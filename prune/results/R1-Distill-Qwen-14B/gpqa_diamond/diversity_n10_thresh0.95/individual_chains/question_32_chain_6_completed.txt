--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The options given are A to D, and I need to calculate which one is correct.

Hmm, first, I should make sure I understand the problem. I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and here X is a specific nucleus. So X is Li-6? Because Li usually has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes 6 nucleons in total. So the mass number A is 6. But wait, wait. Lithium typically has isotopes. For example, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so A=6. Li-7 would have 4 neutrons, but here the problem says 3 neutrons, so yeah, it's Li-6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed v is 0.96c. I think this is about relativistic energy. Because when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects are important.

The basic formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to calculate gamma first.

Wait, but the question is about the energy of the collider. I think that usually, the kinetic energy is what's considered in particle accelerators, but sometimes they might refer to total energy. Wait, no, in colliders, the energy given is the kinetic energy per particle, or the total energy? Hmm, I think in this context, since it's a heavy ion collider, the energy probably refers to the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic). But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The problem says 'the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c'. So perhaps the kinetic energy is the energy being calculated. Or maybe it's the total energy.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous, but in physics problems, unless specified, I think when they say the energy of the collider, they mean the kinetic energy. Or wait, no. Wait, let me think again. In particle accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic energy. But in the context of colliders, when they talk about the collision energy, they often refer to the total energy (gamma*m c²), but sometimes it's the kinetic energy. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-examine the question.

Wait the problem says, 'the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c'. So if the speed is given, and the energy is the total energy (including rest mass), then E = gamma m c². Alternatively, if it's the kinetic energy, then K = (gamma - 1) m c². So which one is it?

In accelerator physics, the energy of the collider is usually the kinetic energy. Because, for example, when they say the LHC operates at 6.5 TeV, that's the kinetic energy per proton. But wait, wait, no, actually, the LHC's energy is given as the proton's total energy, not the kinetic. Because the LHC's energy is 6.5 TeV per proton, which is the total energy, not the kinetic. Because the rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV, which is much smaller than 6.5 TeV. So the total energy is gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So in this problem, if the question is asking for the energy of the collider, they might be referring to the total energy, E = gamma m c².

But in the question, it says 'the energy of RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c'. So perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy. Wait, not sure, but let's proceed and see.

So first, let's compute gamma.

v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Calculating v²/c²: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Now, I need to find the mass of the nucleus X, which is Li-6. The mass number A is 6. So the mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a nucleon. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But for heavy nuclei, people often approximate each nucleon as about 938 MeV/c². But perhaps for better accuracy, we should use the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, but the problem states that X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6. So the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately? Let me think. The exact mass can be found from the periodic table or from standard tables. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the mass of a nucleus, considering the binding energy, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe we can find the mass of Li-6 in terms of u (atomic mass units), then convert to GeV/c².

I think I'll need to look up the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximate method where each nucleon is about 938 MeV/c², but that might lead to a small error.

Wait, the mass of Li-6: the atomic mass is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Because Li-6 has a mass of about 6.015 u. Each u is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg, but we can also convert u to GeV/c².

The conversion factor is 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c², so 0.9315 GeV/c².

So for Li-6, mass m = 6.015 u * 0.9315 GeV/c²/u.

Calculating that: 6.015 * 0.9315.

Let me compute that. 6 * 0.9315 is 5.589, 0.015 * 0.9315 is ≈0.01397. So total m ≈ 5.603 GeV/c².

Wait, let me compute 6.015 * 0.9315:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589.

0.015 * 0.9315 = 0.0139725.

Add them: 5.589 + 0.0139725 = 5.6029725 GeV/c².

Approximately 5.603 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01512 u. So perhaps it's 6.01512 * 0.931494 GeV/c²?

Let me compute that with more precision.

6.01512 * 0.931494 = ?

Let me calculate 6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.01512 * 0.931494 = ?

0.01 * 0.931494 is 0.00931494.

0.00512 * 0.931494 ≈ 0.00512 * 0.9315 ≈ 0.00477888.

Adding them: 0.00931494 + 0.00477888 = 0.01409382.

So total m = 5.588964 + 0.01409382 = approximately 5.6030578 GeV/c².

So m ≈ 5.60306 GeV/c².

So now, with gamma ≈3.5714, E = gamma * m c², which would be 3.5714 * 5.60306 GeV.

Calculating that: 3.5714 *5.60306.

Let me compute 3 *5.60306 =16.80918.

0.5714 *5.60306: 0.5 *5.60306=2.80153, 0.0714 *5.60306 ≈0.4013.

So 2.80153 + 0.4013 ≈3.2028.

Adding to 16.80918: 16.80918 +3.2028≈20.01198 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.012 GeV.

But let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 * 5.60306.

Break it down: 3.5 *5.60306 = 19.61071.

0.0714 *5.60306 ≈0.4013.

So 19.61071 + 0.4013 = 20.01201 GeV.

So about 20.012 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait let's recalculate gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2)) = 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.9216)) = 1/(sqrt(0.0784)).

What is sqrt(0.0784)?

0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714286.

So E = gamma * m c^2.

m c^2 is 5.60306 GeV.

So 3.5714286 *5.60306.

Let me compute 3.5714286 *5.60306.

Compute 3 * 5.60306 = 16.80918.

0.5714286 *5.60306 = ?

0.5 *5.60306 = 2.80153.

0.0714286 *5.60306 ≈0.4008.

Adding 2.80153 + 0.4008 = 3.20233.

Adding to 16.80918: 16.80918 +3.20233 = 20.01151 GeV.

So approximately 20.0115 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. But that's about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, I used 6.01512 u, which is the exact value from the periodic table. Let me confirm.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.01512 u.

Yes, so m = 6.01512 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01512 * 0.9315 GeV.

Wait, 6.01512 *0.9315 = ?

6 *0.9315 =5.589.

0.01512 *0.9315 = let's compute that accurately.

0.01512 *0.9315:

Compute 0.01 *0.9315=0.009315.

0.005 *0.9315=0.0046575.

0.00012 *0.9315=0.00011178.

Adding these: 0.009315 + 0.0046575 = 0.0139725; plus 0.00011178 gives 0.01408428.

So 6.01512 *0.9315 =5.589 +0.01408428=5.60308428 GeV/c².

So m c² is about 5.603084 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.5714286 *5.603084 ≈?

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.5714286 *5.603084.

I can write it as (3 +0.5714286)*5.603084.

3 *5.603084 =16.809252.

0.5714286 *5.603084.

Compute 0.5 *5.603084=2.801542.

0.0714286 *5.603084.

0.07*5.603084=0.3922159.

0.0014286 *5.603084≈0.007999.

Adding 0.3922159 +0.007999=0.4002149.

So 0.5714286 *5.603084=2.801542 +0.4002149=3.2017569.

So total E =16.809252 +3.2017569=20.0110089 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options again: option C is 20.132, option D is 21.419. Hmm, my calculation is 20.011 GeV, but the closest option is C at 20.132. Could I have made a mistake in the mass?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

If E is the total energy, then KE = E - m c^2 = (gamma -1)*m c^2.

So let's compute KE.

Gamma is 3.5714286, so gamma minus 1 is 2.5714286.

So KE = 2.5714286 *5.603084 GeV.

Compute that:

2 *5.603084 =11.206168.

0.5714286 *5.603084 ≈3.201757 as before.

So 11.206168 +3.201757≈14.407925 GeV.

But the options are all in the ~20 GeV range, so that can't be it. So perhaps the question is referring to the total energy, not the kinetic.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the conversion from u to GeV. The exact conversion is 1 u = 931.49406 MeV/c², which is 0.93149406 GeV/c².

So m =6.01512 u * 0.93149406 GeV/u.

Compute 6.01512 * 0.93149406.

6 *0.93149406=5.58896436.

0.01512 *0.93149406.

Calculating 0.01512 *0.93149406:

= (0.01 *0.93149406) + (0.00512 *0.93149406)

=0.0093149406 + (0.005 *0.93149406 + 0.00012 *0.93149406)

=0.0093149406 + (0.0046574703 + 0.0001117793)

=0.0093149406 +0.0047692496=0.0140841902.

So 6.01512 *0.93149406 =5.58896436 +0.0140841902=5.60304855 GeV/c².

So m c²=5.60304855 GeV.

So gamma is 3.5714286, so E=3.5714286 *5.60304855.

Compute 3.5714286 *5.60304855.

Let me compute this accurately.

First, 3 *5.60304855=16.80914565.

0.5714286 *5.60304855.

Compute 0.5*5.60304855=2.801524275.

0.0714286 *5.60304855.

0.07 *5.60304855=0.3922134.

0.0014286 *5.60304855≈0.0080147.

Adding 0.3922134 +0.0080147=0.4002281.

So 0.5714286 *5.60304855=2.801524275 +0.4002281=3.201752375.

So total E=16.80914565 +3.201752375=20.010898025 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. So perhaps I messed up the mass?

Alternatively, maybe the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, so the total energy is E = gamma * m c², which we have as ~20.01 GeV, but none of the options are exactly that.

Wait, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV.

So 20.01 GeV would be closest to option C (20.132), but it's about 0.12 GeV higher. Hmm. Could I have miscalculated the gamma?

Wait, let me recheck gamma.

v = 0.96c.

beta = v/c = 0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So correct, gamma is 1/0.28=3.57142857...

So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) with more precision.

Compute sqrt(0.0784):

We know that 0.28^2=0.0784, but let's compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

0.28 *0.28=0.0784 exactly, so sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So no mistake there.

Hmm. So perhaps the error comes from the mass of the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for the mass of Li-6.

Looking up exact mass: the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.015122786 u.

So m =6.015122786 u * 0.93149406 GeV/u.

Compute 6.015122786 *0.93149406.

Let me compute it step by step.

6 *0.93149406 =5.58896436.

0.015122786 *0.93149406.

Compute 0.01 *0.93149406=0.0093149406.

0.005122786 *0.93149406.

Let me compute 0.005 *0.93149406=0.0046574703.

0.000122786 *0.93149406≈0.00011433.

Adding 0.0046574703 +0.00011433=0.0047718.

So 0.015122786 *0.93149406=0.0093149406 +0.0047718=0.0140867406.

So m c²=5.58896436 +0.0140867406=5.6030511 GeV/c².

So E=3.57142857 *5.6030511.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.6030511 = ?

Let me compute 3 *5.6030511=16.8091533.

0.57142857 *5.6030511.

0.5*5.6030511=2.80152555.

0.07142857 *5.6030511.

0.07 *5.6030511=0.392213577.

0.00142857 *5.6030511 ≈0.00801472.

Adding 0.392213577 +0.00801472=0.400228297.

So 0.57142857 *5.6030511=2.80152555 +0.400228297=3.20175385.

Adding to 16.8091533: 16.8091533 +3.20175385=20.01090715 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest is C)20.132 GeV. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not 6.01512 u, but I think that's correct. Let me look it up.

Upon checking, the exact mass of ^6Li is indeed approximately 6.01512 u.

So I think my calculation is correct, but options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the kinetic energy.

Kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

So K =2.57142857 *5.6030511 GeV.

Compute that:

2 *5.6030511=11.2061022.

0.57142857 *5.6030511≈3.20175385 as before.

So K=11.2061022 +3.20175385=14.407856 GeV.

But the options don't have 14 GeV. So that can't be right.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem is that I'm using the total mass of the nucleus, but RHIC accelerates ions with their binding energy considered. Wait, no, because the rest mass already includes the binding energy. So E = gamma m c² is the correct approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is referring to the energy per nucleon, but no, the question states it's the nucleus X.

Wait, wait. Another thought: perhaps the mass is given as the atomic mass, including electrons, but no, in particle physics, the mass of the nucleus is given without the electrons. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, another thing: perhaps I'm supposed to use the atomic number and neutron number to calculate the mass, considering the exact binding energy, but that would complicate things, and I think the question expects us to use the approximate mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but the question is about the kinetic energy, not the total. But in that case, as I calculated, K is about 14.4 GeV, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the energy is per nucleon? Let me think. No, the question says 'the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c.' So it's per nucleus.

Unless the question is referring to the energy in a different way, but I can't think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question states that the speed is 0.96c, but the energy is the kinetic energy. So let's compute K = (gamma-1) m c². Which was 14.4 GeV, but that's not an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy, but I think I did that correctly.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the wrong value for the mass. Let me check the exact mass again.

Wait, ^6Li has an exact mass of 6.015122786 u.

So m c² =6.015122786 u * 931.49406 MeV/u.

Compute that.

6 *931.49406 MeV=5588.96436 MeV.

0.015122786 *931.49406 MeV.

Compute 0.01 *931.49406=9.3149406 MeV.

0.005122786 *931.49406= approx 4.7719 MeV.

So 9.3149406 +4.7719≈14.0868 MeV.

So total m c²=5588.96436 +14.0868≈5603.051 MeV=5.603051 GeV.

Which matches what I had before.

So I'm confident that the energy is about 20.01 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mass is not 6, but the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, which would be Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass number 6. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of 3.57142857 *5.6030511 is wrong.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6030511.

Use calculator-like approach:

3 *5.6030511=16.8091533.

0.57142857 *5.6030511.

Compute 0.5 *5.6030511=2.80152555.

0.07142857 *5.6030511.

Compute 0.07 *5.6030511=0.392213577.

0.00142857 *5.6030511≈0.0080147.

So 0.07 part is 0.392213577 +0.0080147=0.400228277.

Adding to 2.80152555: 2.80152555 +0.400228277 =3.201753827.

Total E=16.8091533 +3.201753827=20.0109071 GeV.

Hmm, same as before.

So unless the options have a typo or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the energy is calculated using the relativistic work-energy theorem, where the kinetic energy is the integral of force over distance, but that's the same as the approach I took.

Wait, perhaps the collider's energy is given per nucleon, but the question says 'nucleus X', so it's per nucleus.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The correct calculation gives about 20.01 GeV, and option C is 20.132, which is close. Could there be a rounding difference?

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is considered to be 6 *938 MeV/c². So 6 *0.938 GeV=5.628 GeV.

Then, E=gamma *m c²=3.57142857 *5.628.

Compute that:

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628 ≈3.207.

Total E≈16.884 +3.207=20.091 GeV.

Closer to 20.09 GeV. Now, option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, maybe using 6 *938.272 MeV/c² for the mass.

So 6 *0.938272 GeV=5.629632 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.629632.

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.57142857 *5.629632≈3.209.

So E≈16.888896 +3.209=20.097896 GeV.

Approximately 20.098 GeV, which is closer to 20.1, but option C is 20.132.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 *938.272 MeV, which is 5.629632 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.629632 GeV.

Compute that:

3.57142857 *5.629632.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.629632.

Alternatively, 3.57142857 *5.629632:

Calculate 3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.57142857*5.629632.

0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.07142857 *5.629632≈0.400228.

So 2.814816 +0.400228=3.215044.

So total E=16.888896 +3.215044=20.10394 GeV.

Approx 20.104 GeV.

Still, option C is 20.132. Hmm. Maybe this approach is what the problem expects, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for the mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 *938 MeV. So 5.628 GeV.

Then gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 = let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.628.

Compute 3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628=3.210.

So E=16.884 +3.210=20.094 GeV.

Which would be approximately 20.094 GeV. Closer to 20.1, but option C is 20.132.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the exact gamma is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, I think I've made a mistake in considering gamma.

Wait, v is 0.96c. So beta = 0.96.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571.

So that's correct.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy equation but with a different approximation, such as using the total energy as gamma * m_nucleon * A, where m_nucleon is each nucleon's rest mass.

But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula E = gamma * m c², and the mass is 6 * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass. But that would ignore the binding energy, leading to a higher mass.

Wait, let's compute that.

If I take m =6 *938.272 MeV/c² =5.629632 GeV/c².

E=gamma *5.629632 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.629632 = approx 20.1039 GeV.

Which is about 20.104 GeV. So option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher, but perhaps the calculation in the problem used more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a more precise value for gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 -beta^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2)=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So same as before.

Hmm. If I compute 3.5714285714 *5.6030511 GeV, I get about 20.0109 GeV.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the intended approach is to calculate the kinetic energy, but that gives around 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy given is the kinetic energy, and one of the options is in that ballpark. But option C is 20.132, which is higher than 14.4. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mixing up speed with something else, but that's unclear.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, but the relativistic energy calculation is being done using the rest mass energy as m_p c², not the actual mass. But that would be incorrect, but perhaps the problem expects that approach.

So let's try that.

Assume each nucleon has a rest mass of 938 MeV/c², so for 6 nucleons, m=6 *0.938=5.628 GeV/c².

E=gamma *5.628 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.628=20.1039 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.104 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132). The difference might be due to using more precise figures for gamma or the mass.

So perhaps the correct answer is C)20.132 GeV.

But wait, why is the calculation giving 20.104 when option C is 20.132? There's a discrepancy of about 0.028 GeV.

Hmm. Let me compute more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628= let's compute it.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628≈0.400228.

So 2.814 +0.400228=3.214228.

So total E=16.884 +3.214228=20.098228 GeV.

Approximately 20.098 GeV.

Hmm, which is still 20.098, but option C is 20.132. So perhaps the problem used a more accurate value of the mass, such as using 6 *938.272 MeV.

So 6 *938.272 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.629632.

Compute this:

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.57142857 *5.629632.

Let me compute 0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.07142857 *5.629632=0.400228.

So 2.814816 +0.400228=3.215044.

Summing to 16.888896: 16.888896 +3.215044=20.10394 GeV.

Approximately 20.104 GeV.

So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but it's still a bit off. Perhaps the problem expects rounding to four decimal places, or perhaps the options have a typo.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but that wouldn't make sense because the speed is for the nucleus as a whole.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula but the mass is taken as 6 times the mass of a proton, without considering that neutrons have slightly higher mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and my calculation is missing a factor. Wait, I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise beta.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta^2 is 0.9216. Then 1 - beta^2 is 0.0784.

The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, as 0.28^2=0.0784.

So no error there.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation leads me to approximately 20.01 GeV, but the option is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the speed. Wait, 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precision.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly, so no issues there.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to compute the total energy as (gamma * m_p * A), but that's the same as what I did.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic momentum formula, but that's not applicable here.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy as 5.6 GeV, and wanted to compute E = gamma * m c² as 3.5714 *5.6 GeV.

Which would be 3.5714 *5.6=20.0 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.0.

Well, perhaps the intended answer is C)20.132 GeV, considering the rounding of the mass or gamma to more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again using more precise numbers.

Wait, beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Compute 1 - beta^2 =1 - (0.96)^2 =1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

Compute sqrt(0.0784) precisely.

Well, sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571...

So that's correct.

Hmm. I can't find any error in my calculation. Thus, the closest option to my calculation is not present, but perhaps the intended answer is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer should be around 20.01 GeV, but it's not among the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 20.132 GeV.

Which is about 0.12 GeV higher than my calculation.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps the problem considers the rest mass as 6 *938 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV, and then gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628=20.1039 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1039 GeV. So the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher but perhaps due to more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as 6 *938.272 MeV, which is 5.629632 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.629632=20.1039 GeV.

Still, the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma, like using more decimal places.

Wait, let me compute gamma with more precision.

gamma =1/(sqrt(1 -0.96^2)) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So precise.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Since my precise calculation gives approximately 20.01 GeV, but that's not an option, I might have to choose the closest option, which is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question, but among the options, C is the closest.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy principles. The nucleus \( X \) is Lithium-6 (\(^6\text{Li}\)), which has a mass number \( A = 6 \). The energy of the collider is calculated using the total energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed \( v = 0.96c \), so:

\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = 0.96, \quad \beta^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rest mass energy of \( ^6\text{Li} \)
The mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \) is approximately \( 6.01512 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.494 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to GeV:

\[
m = 6.01512 \, u \times 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/u \approx 5.6031 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

Thus, the rest mass energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 5.6031 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.6031 \approx 20.011 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.011 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:

- **A)** \( 18.475 \, \text{GeV} \): Too low.
- **B)** \( 23.069 \, \text{GeV} \): Too high.
- **C)** \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \): Closest to the calculated value.
- **D)** \( 21.419 \, \text{GeV} \): Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher than the computed value due to potential rounding differences or approximations in the problem setup.

Answer: C
