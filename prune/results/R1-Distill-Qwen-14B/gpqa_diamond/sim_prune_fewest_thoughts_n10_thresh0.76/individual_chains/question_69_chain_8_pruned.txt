Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The setup includes an energy of 27 GeV and a mass of X⁰ being 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that particle decay problems often involve the concept of the proper lifetime and the observed lifetime. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when we observe it in the lab frame, we have to account for time dilation due to special relativity.

So the formula for the observed lifetime τ is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is equal to E/(m c²) since for a relativistic particle, the energy E is much larger than the rest mass. Oh wait, but in this case, the energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So E is much larger than m, so γ would be E/(m c²) — but wait, the units here, since E and m are given in GeV, and c is a big number, but maybe when we're using E and m in the same units, the c² cancels out. Hmm, yeah, because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). Oh wait, but since both E and m are in GeV, and c is in m/s, but when we're taking E/(m c²), the units would be (GeV) / (GeV * (m/s)^2) ) → 1/(m²/s²) ) → s²/m²? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the units here. I'll proceed with the formula.

So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but wait, E is the total energy, which is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Oh, but wait, in high-energy physics, energy is often given as E = γ m c², so if E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV
