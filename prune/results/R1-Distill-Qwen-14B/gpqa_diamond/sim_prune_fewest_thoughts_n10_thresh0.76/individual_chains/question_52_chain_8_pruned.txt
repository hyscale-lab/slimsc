Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Hmm, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when spots are present versus when they're not.

Wait, so the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The options are given as A to D.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the population of different energy levels is determined by the Saha equation and the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy levels to the temperature.

The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of populations (n_i / n_j) is proportional to exp(- (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where E_i and E_j are the energies of the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the transition wavelength is given as about 1448 Å. That's in the near ultraviolet range. So this transition corresponds to a photon with energy E = hc/λ. Hmm, but maybe I don't need the exact energy difference, but perhaps just the ratio based on the temperature.

So let's think. The ratio without spots is n1/n2 before, and with spots it's n1/n2 after. I need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, no, the question says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots, which would be a number greater than 1.

The ratio of populations depends on the temperature because the exponential term changes with T. So the main thing is to compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors at the two temperatures.

Wait, let me think. The ratio is (n1/n2) = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Or wait, if the energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1, then the ratio n1/n2 would be exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) if E2 > E1, because if E2 is higher, fewer atoms are in E2, so higher ratio for n1/n2.

Wait, wait, let's be precise. Let's say level 1 has energy E1, level 2 has E2. If E2 > E1, then the ratio n1/n2 = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )? No, wait—no, the Boltzmann distribution is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i > E_j, then the exponent is negative, so n_i / n_j is less than 1, meaning fewer atoms in the higher energy level.

Wait, so when E2 > E1, the ratio n1/n2 = exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

Now, the transition between the two levels is at a wavelength of 1448 Å. The energy difference is given by E = hc/λ. So let's compute ΔE.

But wait, maybe I don't need the actual energy. Because I can express the ratio in terms of the temperatures.

Let me denote T1 as 6000 K (no spots) and T2 as 5500 K (with spots). The ratio when no spots: R1 = n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

The ratio when spots: R2 = n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor is R1 / R2 = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / exp( (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ) )

Wait, because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So let me compute the exponent:

(-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, no, more accurately:

The exponents are subtracted when you divide: exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). So in this case, a is (-ΔE/(k T1)), and b is (-ΔE/(k T2)), so a - b = [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) ] - [ (-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ]

So that becomes (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

But wait, 1/T2 is less than 1/T1 since T2 < T1. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is negative, so the exponent is negative. Thus, the factor R1/R2 is exp( negative number ), so less than 1. But wait, wait, when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So R1/R2 should be greater than 1. Hmm, but according to this, if T2 is smaller than T1, then 1/T2 > 1/T1. Wait, no, T is in the denominator.

Wait, let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1. T2 is 5500 K, T1 is 6000 K.

So 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667. So 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151.

So positive. So (ΔE/k) * 0.0000151. So the exponent is positive. So exp( positive number ), which is greater than 1. So R1/R2 is greater than 1, which makes sense because when spots are present, the ratio R2 is lower than R1.

Wait, let me get the exact value. Let me compute the term:

(ΔE/k) * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

But ΔE is hc/λ. Let's compute hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1.448e-10 meters.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-10 = approx 1.372e-15 J.

But J is kg·m²/s², so converting to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-15 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56e3 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.56 keV.

Wait, that's a bit high; typical atomic transitions are in the eV range, but maybe for Ti it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate hc/λ:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, but for calculation, 6.626e-34 is fine).

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s, but approx 3e8 for rough calculation.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m? Wait no, wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 1448 Angstroms is 1.448e-7 meters?

Wait
