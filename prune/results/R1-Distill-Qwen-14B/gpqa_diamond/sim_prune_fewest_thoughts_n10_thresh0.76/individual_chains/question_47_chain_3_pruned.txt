Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data. Let's see, the compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's think about what that could be.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are strong to medium. Those are broad peaks, probably O-H stretching. Wait, no, maybe N-H? Because O-H usually has a broader peak, but sometimes N-H can be around there too. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a key one. That's probably a carbonyl group. A carbonyl could be from an amide, ester, ketone, or maybe an acid. But in this case, the options don't have a ketone or acid. Let's look at the options.

Looking at the options, I see options with amides and esters. Option A is 3-ethoxybenzamide, which has an amide group. Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, another amide. Option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which is an amide as well because it's an amino acid derivative. Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester because it's an ester of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol.

So the IR shows a strong peak at 1720. For esters, the carbonyl is usually around 1720-1750. For amides, it's a bit lower, maybe around 1650-1700. Wait, but the given peak is at 1720, which is more in line with an ester. Or maybe it's an amide if it's a less substituted carbonyl. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet. Let's look at the NMR.

The 1H NMR data: 1.20 ppm triplet (3H). That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet would come from being next to a CH2 group. Next, 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H). Broad singlet could be an NH2 group, but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: if that's an NH, but the integration is 2H, maybe it's an -N-CH2- group. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group. Hmm. Then 4.5 ppm quartet (2H). Quartet with 2H suggests it's adjacent to a CH2 that's split into a quartet. So maybe this is a CH2 connected to an O or N, and next to another CH2.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 8.0 ppm doublet (2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and split into doublets
