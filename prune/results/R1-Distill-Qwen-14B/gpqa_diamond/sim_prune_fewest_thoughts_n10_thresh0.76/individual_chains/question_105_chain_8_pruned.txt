Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes, which they observe as periodic variations. It's mentioned that this situation can mimic an exoplanet's signal. The question is asking what the radius of such a hypothetical exoplanet would need to be relative to the star's radius to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with the change in brightness when a planet transits in front of the star versus when spots rotate into and out of view.

First, let's understand both scenarios.

When a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness (the dip) is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius. So that's the planet's signal.

In the case of the star spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they face us (as the star rotates), they contribute less to the total brightness. So the dip in brightness depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, so the star's total brightness without spots would be different. The spots are 20% of one hemisphere, but wait, noâ€”the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So each hemisphere is a sphere, right? No, wait, the star is a sphere, and each hemisphere is half the surface. So the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere.

Wait, the way the problem is written, one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, 20% of that would be 10% of the total star's surface. Wait, no. Wait, the star's total surface area is 4
