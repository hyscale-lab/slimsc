Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says I prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that tells me there's an O-CO-O group somewhere. Esters have a carbonyl group, which usually shows up around 1700 cm^-1 in IR. So that's a key point.

The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's break that down. There are two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons could be in different environments. Wait, di-substituted—so maybe it's para, meta, or ortho. If para, the two H's are equivalent, so one peak. But maybe the substituents are such that each substituent affects the ring differently. Hmm, but the problem says two signals, so maybe two sets of aromatic Hs. Oh wait, para substitution would lead to two equivalent H's, but if substituents are different, maybe that's not the case. Or maybe it's a vinyl group attached to the ring. Wait, I need to think about the other parts.

The NMR also mentions two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets would mean coupling with two sets of protons, maybe each with different J values. Wait, maybe it's a trans coupling? Or perhaps adjacent to a CH2 group?

Lastly, two signals for –CH3 groups. So two different CH3 groups. That suggests maybe two different substituents each attached with a methyl group, or perhaps the same substituent but in different environments.

And there are no signals for –CH2 groups, so the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups. That's important. So maybe all the CH2 groups are either part of substituents that are more complex but don't have CH2 in their structure.

So putting this together. The compound is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group. Let's think about possible structures.

Ester groups could be either aromatic esters or aliphatic esters. For example,
