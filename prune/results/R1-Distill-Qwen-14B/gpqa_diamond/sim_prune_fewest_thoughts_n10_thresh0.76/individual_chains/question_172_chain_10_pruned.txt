Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms is related to their temperature. Oh wait, this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution, right?

So the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. In this case, since both stars are in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), I can apply that here.

In the question, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote this as ΔE = E_i - E_j, assuming the higher energy level is i and lower is j. Or wait, the problem says the energy difference is between the considered levels. So whether it's E_i - E_j or E_j - E_i, the difference is the same in magnitude. But the populations depend on the exponent.

Wait, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n_i^1 / n_j^1 = 2? Or wait, wait. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Does that mean the population in the higher energy level is higher for star_1? I think so. So for each star, we have n_i / n_j equals some function of their temperature.

So the ratio for star_1 is (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) and for star_2 is (n_i^2)/(n_j^2). The problem says that star_1 has twice as many in the excited state, so maybe n_i^1 = 2 * n_i^2, but wait no, because the denominator n_j is different for each star. Hmm, maybe it's better to take the ratio between the two stars.

Wait, the question states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps in star_1, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) is twice
