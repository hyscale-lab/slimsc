Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about completing two reactions and picking the major products. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as the base. I remember that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, it's probably an example of a conjugate addition, like the Aldol reaction but maybe more specific. Wait, wait, another possibility is that it's a Diels-Alder reaction. No, wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, maybe it's an enolate formation. Oh wait, since ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, it could act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder, but that would require a diene. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexanone is acting as a nucleophile, but I think more likely it's a conjugate addition.

Wait a minute, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 are each substituted: position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl), and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, wait, actually, 2-ethyl would mean one substituent is ethyl at C2, and the 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at C2 and C6. Wait, noâ€”wait, the numbering: the ketone is at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group (since 2,6-dimethyl would mean C2 and C6 have methyl groups). Wait, no, no: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the substituents are at C2: ethyl and methyl. And C6 has a methyl. So C1 is the ketone, C2 has ethyl and methyl (so perhaps a geminal di-substitution? Like, two substituents on C2: one ethyl, one methyl. So it's 2-ethyl-2-methyl-6-methylcyclohexanone. So the structure would have the ketone at C1, and C2 has ethyl and methyl groups, and C6 has a methyl.

So, when we treat this with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. t-BuOK would deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate would then attack the alpha, beta-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition.

Wait, but in such cases, the enolate can form at either the more substituted position if possible, considering steric factors. So the cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens at which positions? The ketone is at
