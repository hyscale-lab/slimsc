Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both, so each compound is a disubstituted or tetrasubstituted benzene with some methyl groups, I think. 

The NMR data shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. That probably means there are two different sets of aromatic protons, each as a singlet. Wait, but singlets in aromatic regions usually mean that the protons have equivalent neighboring groups or perhaps are in symmetric positions so they don't split each other. 

Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. 2.2 ppm is typical for methyl groups attached to something, like maybe an aromatic ring. So these are probably CH3 groups. The ratio is 2:1:1, which might mean that there are three different types of methyl groups. Wait, but 2:1:1 sums to four? No, wait, the area ratios: if the integral is 2:1:1, that suggests maybe two methyl groups of one type, and one each of two others? Hmm, but each compound in the mixture has four methyl groups, perhaps? Because each is a tetramethylbenzene. Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14: for benzene, C6H6. Each methyl group is CH3. So if it's a tetramethyl, that's 4 methyl groups. So the molecular formula would be C6H6 plus 4*(CH3) → C6+4= C10, H6 + 4*3 = H18. Wait, but the given formula is C10H14. Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Benzene has C6H6. Each methyl is CH3. So 4 methyl groups would give 4*3=12 H, so the total would be 6 +12=18 H. But the formula is C10H14. Hmm, that suggests that the molecule has less hydrogen. Oh wait, perhaps the substituents are not all methyl? Or maybe some substituents are more complex. Wait, looking at the options, all are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl is two CH2CH3 groups, so maybe that's one of the compounds. 

Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, so option C includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let's calculate the molecular formula for each compound.

Tetramethylbenzene would have 4 methyl groups. So each is C6H5(CH3)4. Wait, but that would be C10H14, because benzene (C6H6) plus 4*(CH3) → 4* (C=1, H=3) → 4 C, 12 H. So C6+4=10, H6+12=18. But the formula here is C10H14. Hmm, discrepancy. So wait, perhaps the substituents are not all methyl.

Wait, wait... Let me think again. The molecular formula is C10H14.
