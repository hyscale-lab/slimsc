Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options given are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene.

Hmm. So first, I should think about what the molecular formula C10H14 implies. Benzene has six carbons, so with four substituents (since it's tetramethyl), each substituent is a methyl group. Wait, wait. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. For C10H14: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four DoU. Benzene has three (a ring and three double bonds), and the four methyl groups add one each, but wait, actually, each methyl is a single bond, so no additional DoU. Wait, no. The benzene ring is three DoU (one ring and two double bonds, but each double bond is one DoU; a ring is one, so benzene contributes three). The C10H14 must be benzene with four substituents, each being a methyl group. Because each CH3 is a single bond. So four methyl groups on benzene would give C6H5(CH3)4, which is C10H14. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene isomer.

Wait, but wait: the options include 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me check its molecular formula. Diethyl groups: each ethyl is -CH2CH3. So benzene with two ethyl groups would be C8H10. But the molecular formula given is C10H14. Wait, wait: C6H5-C2H5-C2H5? No, that's 6 + 2 + 2 = 10, but the formula would be C10H14? Let me calculate.

Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5. Two ethyl groups would add 2*(C2H5) = C4H10. So total C:6+4=10. H:6-2*5=6-10? Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, each ethyl group is -CH2CH3, so each has 2 carbons and 7 hydrogens? Wait, no, no. When you attach an ethyl group to benzene, each ethyl contributes 2 carbons and the benzene loses a hydrogen. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Adding one ethyl group (CH2CH3) would make it C7H7, but that's not right. Wait, the formula for ethylbenzene is C6H5CH2CH3, which is C8H10. So two ethyl groups would be C6H5(CH2CH3)2, which is C10H14. Oh, right, because each ethyl is two carbons and five hydrogens (since the benzene ring has one H replaced). So two ethyl groups would be 2*(5 H) + the other H from the benzene ring. Wait, maybe it's better to count all H's. Benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group replaces one H, so two ethyls would replace two H's, so 6-2=4 H left on the ring. Each ethyl contributes 2*2=4 H (since
