Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation for a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a pretty complex molecule with double bonds and branching.

Wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I think I need to calculate it using bond energies. The formula for that is usually the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum for the products, but I might be mixing that up.

The data given includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, I remember that the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element and form atoms. So for carbon, each C-C bond would require 1000 kJ/mol to break into two C atoms.

Wait, but for bond energies, each bond is per mole. So for example, a C-C bond has an energy of 200 kJ/mol. So when you break a C-C bond, you're using 200 kJ per mole of bonds.

The molecule given: let me try to count the number of each type of bond. So, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me draw it out mentally.

So, each (CH3)2C=CH- group. That's a substituted double bond. Similarly, on the other end, there's a CH=C(CH3)2. So the molecule likely has two double bonds, each of which is a C=C bond.

Wait, let me count all the bonds. Each C-H bond is 400 kJ/mol. Each C-C bond is 200 kJ. Each C=C is 300 kJ. H-H is 100, but since H's are diatomic, but I don't think any H-H bonds are present in the product, only in the reactants.

Wait, the process is: to calculate the enthalpy of formation, we assume the reaction is from the elements in their standard states. So, the reactants would be carbon (graphite or diamond) and hydrogen gas (H2). The products are the given molecule and any other substances like water or CO2? No, wait, enthalpy of formation is for the compound from elements, so probably the product is the molecule and maybe H2O if oxygen were involved, but the problem doesn't mention O. So assuming this compound is purely from C and H.

So for the reaction: Elements (C and H2) → Compound.

The formula for the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) using bond energies is:

ΔHf = [Σ (Bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]

Wait, wait. Alternatively, another approach: the enthalpy of formation is calculated assuming bonds are broken in the reactants and formed in the products. So, the formula is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond
