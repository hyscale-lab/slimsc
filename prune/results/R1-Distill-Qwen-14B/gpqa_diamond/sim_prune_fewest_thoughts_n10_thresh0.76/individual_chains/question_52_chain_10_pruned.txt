Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Oh, no, that's not right. Because when spots cover part of the surface, the overall temperature would decrease. Oh wait, but in the question, it says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So without spots, it's 6000 K, with 40% spots, 5500 K.

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (levels 1 and 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And the question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

So, the ratio is N1/N2 without spots divided by N1/N2 with spots. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio without spots is higher, so the factor is greater than 1.

They mention that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. So that's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. And they assume LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies.

Hmm. So for each part of the photosphere, the ratio N1/N2 would depend on the temperature. The ratio of the populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)).

Wait, but wait: the energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1, right? So if E2 is higher than E1, then the ratio would decrease as temperature increases.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is lower. But the
