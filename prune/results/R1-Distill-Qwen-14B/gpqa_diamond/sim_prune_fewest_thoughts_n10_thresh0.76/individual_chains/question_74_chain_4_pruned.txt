Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, 32% of such atoms would have decayed on average. Now, the twist here is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, is that the next 150 minutes from now, so 50 to 200 minutes total? Or is it the next 150 minutes after the initial 100? No, wait, the initial decay probability is given for 100 minutes, but the time that has passed is 50, so the remaining time would be 150 minutes after that, making it 200 total. But maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says the atom hasn't decayed in the past 50 minutes. So we're looking for the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start is 50+150=200 minutes. But what matters is the conditional probability now that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The decay probability is not dependent on the time already passed; each atom has a constant probability per unit time of decaying. So the decay process is memoryless. That means the probability of decay in a certain future period depends only on the remaining time, not on how long it's been already.

But wait, how is the given 32% within 100 minutes used? Let me think. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life, but perhaps it's easier to model using the probability formula.

The probability that a nucleus decays within time t is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt). Wait, but that's the cumulative distribution function. Alternatively, the decay follows an exponential distribution, so the probability of decaying after time t is the same as a new process starting at t. Since the process is memoryless.

Wait, so after 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. The
