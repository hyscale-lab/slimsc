Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about expectation values, right? I've studied a bit about this, but let me think carefully. 

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. I remember that σz is the Pauli z matrix, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. And I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

So, expectation value formula is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So O here is 10σz +5σx. I can probably break this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Since expectation is linear, that should be okay.

Let me write down the state ψ first. ψ is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, let me check the normalization. The squares of the coefficients: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Sum is 1, so it's properly normalized. Good.

Now, for σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, the expectation value is straightforward. The state ψ is a linear combination, so ⟨σz⟩ is 0.5^2*(+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2*(-1). Let me compute that.

0.5 squared is 0.25, times 1 is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75, times (-1) is -0.75. So adding 0.25 and -0.75 gives -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the expectation value of 10σz is 10 times that, which is 10*(-0.
