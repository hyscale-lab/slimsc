Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and we need to determine the final product after a series of reactions. The reagents used are in three steps: first, NaNO2 and HCl; second, H2O; and third, aqueous KOH with heat. The options provided are four different aldehydes with substituents.

First, I should analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Let's break down the NMR signals:

1. 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so likely an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. A triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, could be adjacent to a CH2 group, like in a CH2CHO structure.

2. 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Two protons, each coupled to one neighbor. Maybe from an aromatic ring with substituents. The downfield shift suggests electron-withdrawing groups, but wait, the aromatic protons in the next peak are lower.

3. 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. Since it's a doublet, perhaps they're adjacent to the substituents on the ring. Maybe this is a para-substituted benzene ring.

4. 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an acidic proton, perhaps from a phenol or an enol. Two protons here. Maybe a di-substituted ring with two hydroxyl groups? Or maybe they are part of a conjugated system, like an enol.

5. 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This looks like a CH2 group. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring group. A CH2 connected to something with one proton, maybe an oxygen or another CH.

Putting this together: the molecule probably has an aldehyde group, an aromatic ring, and some substituents that might include oxygen. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1 )/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond (1). Or maybe a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (1). Hmm.

Looking at the NMR, I see an aldehyde (9.72 ppm), so that's one group. The aromatic signals suggest two different sets of protons, maybe two benz
