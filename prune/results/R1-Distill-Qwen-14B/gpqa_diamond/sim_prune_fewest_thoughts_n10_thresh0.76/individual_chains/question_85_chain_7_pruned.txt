Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives a lot of data. The star has 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radii, and a Teff of 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but for equilibrium temperature, maybe it's about the absorbed energy.

The question mentions transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method measures the dip in brightness as the planet passes in front of the star, which can give the radius of the planet and the size of the orbit. Radial velocity detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. That gives the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Oh, right, because the planet absorbs energy from the star and radiates it as blackbody radiation. Here, albedo is the same for both, so that factor will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio of temperatures T1/T2 would be sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2)) ), which simplifies to sqrt(a2/a1). Because the R_star and 2 are constants, they cancel out. So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, no, wait, because the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star, a. Because T scales as (L/(16πσ a²))^0.25, and L is the star's luminosity.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. The star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star^2 σ Teff^4. Then the flux at distance a is F = L/(4π
