Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about the percentage of a particular cobalt complex in solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

So, the setup is that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think corresponds to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Or wait, wait. Let me think. Cobalt can form complexes with different numbers of SCN- ligands. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2-n), where n is the number of ligands. So, n=1, 2, 3,4.

Stability constant βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from Co^2+ and n SCN-. The higher β, the more stable the complex. So, the most stable complex is the one with the highest β. Looking at the given values, β3 is 63, which is the highest. Oh wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm not sure which complex is blue. I think in some cases, Co(SCN)_2^2+ is blue, and Co(SCN)_3^- is something else, maybe pink or another color. But the question specifies the blue dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- per Co^2+. So the complex we're interested in is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So, to find the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species, I think we need to calculate the fraction of total Co that is in this particular complex. The total cobalt is the sum of all possible complexes and the free Co^2+.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the log of the stability constants, but I'm not exactly sure how. Maybe using the formula for the fraction of each species based on their stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

Wait, the general approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step. The formation of each complex depends on the availability of Co^2+ and the ligand SCN-.

The formation of each complex can be represented as:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} 

Each with a stability constant βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^{2−n} ] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

But since multiple complexes can form, the distribution of Co among the complexes depends on these β values, the ligand concentration, and the total Co concentration.

Wait, given that the ligand concentration is much higher than the metal concentration (0.1 M SCN- vs 1e-2 M Co^2+), we can assume that the ligand isn't limiting. So, the formation of higher-order complexes is favored.
