Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question. Hmm, let's read it again carefully.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Then there's a variant where instead of 2V, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

The question is about how the E particles' energy spectrum changes in the variant compared to the original. The options are about whether the spectrum becomes discrete or remains continuous, and whether the endpoint increases or decreases.

Wait, I remember something about beta decay and the energy spectrum of beta particles. In beta decay, a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. The electron's energy can vary, with a continuous spectrum up to a maximum value. That's because the Q-value is shared between the electron and the neutrino. So the maximum energy is when all the energy goes to the electron, but that's not possible because momentum must be conserved. Oh wait, no, the maximum is when the neutrino gets zero energy, but that's not allowed. So the electron's energy is continuous up to a maximum Q.

But in the variant, another particle is emitted. Oh wait, in the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. In the variant, 2E and M are emitted. But M is a massless particle, I think that's like a photon or a neutrino, which has zero mass. So in the original decay, each E and V would carry some energy.

But how does emitting another particle affect the energy spectrum of E? Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum. In the original case, 2E and 2V are emitted. Since V is a lighter particle, maybe a pion or something similar. But in the variant, 2E and M are emitted. Since M is massless, maybe it's like a photon or a neutrino.

In the original decay, when two particles are emitted (E and V), the energy of E can vary. But wait, in the original, it's 2E and 2V. So perhaps each E and each V carry away energy, but the system's energy is divided among all four. So the E particles' energy would depend on the V's as well.
