Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They're using a plasmid with an inducible promoter, and they've introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the overexpression didn't happen as expected.

Looking at the construct's plus strand sequence provided, I need to figure out why the protein isn't being expressed. The options given are A to D.

Hmm, let's break it down. The sequence provided is the coding (sense) strand, meaning it's the same as the mRNA except T instead of U. They added an HA tag at the N-terminus, so the HA should be the first part of the protein.

Wait, the HA tag is an antigenic determinant, so it's a short peptide. I think the HA tag is typically about 10 amino acids. Let me recall: the HA tag is usually derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. The coding sequence for the HA tag is something like YPYDVPDYA, which is about 10 amino acids. That's 30 nucleotides (since each amino acid is 3 nt, except sometimes with reading frame considerations). 

Looking at the given sequence starting from the beginning: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So ATG is the start codon. Then TAC is Tyr, CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr again, GAT is Asp, G is G... Wait, that's the HA tag? Let me check. The HA tag's DNA sequence is usually like ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAT CCG CGG, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the start.

Wait, the start codon is at the beginning, ATG. Then TAC is Tyr. So that's the HA tag starting. Let's see: the HA tag's nucleotide sequence is often: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GAT CCG CGG. But wait, looking at the given sequence, the first part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So that would be TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), G... Hmm, wait, perhaps the HA tag is correctly present here. So the sequence starts with ATG, then TAC CCA TAC GAT G... which is the HA coding part.

But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed. So why might that be?

Looking at the options:

Option A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

Hmm, a missense mutation would change an amino acid. But if the HA tag isn't working,
