Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what an algorithm does based on some examples, and then apply it to a new input. Let's break it down step by step.

The examples given are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176
And I need to find the output for ACAGTGACC.

Hmm, first I should look for a pattern between the input strings and their outputs. The inputs are DNA sequences, made up of the nucleotides A, T, C, G. The outputs are numbers, so the algorithm probably converts each nucleotide into a number and sums them up or does something like that.

Let me list each nucleotide and its position in the input strings:

For AGG:
Positions are A, G, G.
Output is 115.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a value. Let's think about their possible values. Like, A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Or maybe the other way around, or some other arrangement.

Wait, if I compute for AGG:

A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. Sum is 1+4+4=9. That's way less than 115. So maybe not just summing. Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide is multiplied by a certain weight, or perhaps the positions matter.

Another approach: looking at the second example. TGCTGA has 6 letters. Let's see:

T, G, C, T, G, A.

If I assign values to each:
T= maybe 20, G=7, C=3, A=1? Let's test that.

Wait, let's compute the sum for TGCTGA with some assignments.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's based on the molecular weight of each base. Because DNA is made of nucleotides which have molecular weights.

The molecular weights are approximately:
A: 330 g/mol (adenine)
T: 304 g/mol (thymine)
C: 307 g/mol (cytosine)
G: 346 g/mol (guanine)

Wait, but adding these up for each sequence.

Let's try the first example: AGG.

Adenine (A) is 330, G is 346, another G is 346. So total
