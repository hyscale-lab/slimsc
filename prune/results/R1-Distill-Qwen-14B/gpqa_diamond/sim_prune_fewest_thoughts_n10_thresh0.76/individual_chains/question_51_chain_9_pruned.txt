Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that probably means its potential is zero, right? Or wait, no, grounding usually means it's connected to the Earth, which is at zero potential, so the sphere's potential is zero.

So when the charge q is placed near the sphere, it will induce charges on the sphere. Because the sphere is conductor, the induced charges will reside on the surface. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge on it will adjust such that the potential of the sphere remains zero. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the sphere remains at zero potential because it's grounded, so any excess charge would flow into the ground.

Wait, no. Let me think again. A grounded conducting sphere will have charges that adjust so that its surface is an equipotential. But if it's neutral, then no charges would be on it. If I bring a charge q near it, the sphere will have induced charges. Since the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will be on the surface. But because it's grounded, any charge that induces on it would cause a current to flow to the ground. So the sphere will have an induced charge that depends
