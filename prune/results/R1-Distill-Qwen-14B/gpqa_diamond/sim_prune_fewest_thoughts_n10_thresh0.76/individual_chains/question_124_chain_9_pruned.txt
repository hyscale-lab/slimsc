Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again.

So, particles are being collided in the center of a spherical detector. When they collide, new particles are produced. These new particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, and their Lorentz factor is about 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls?

Wait, I think I remember something about particles decaying and how their lifetimes relate to whether they reach the detector walls. Oh right! It's about the proper lifetime and the dilated lifetime due to special relativity.

So, when a particle is moving at a high velocity (ultra-relativistic), its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The formula for the Lorentz factor gamma is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But more importantly, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau), so t = gamma * tau.

The particles are produced at the center of the sphere, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. The time it takes for them to reach the wall is the distance divided by their speed. But since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So, t = R / c, where R is 30 meters.

But wait, actually, since the speed is very close to c, it's better to use t = R / beta c, where beta is v/c. Because v = beta c. So, for ultra-relativistic particles, beta is very close to 1, so beta ≈ 1. But for exact calculations, we should keep it as beta.

So, the condition is that the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma must be greater than or equal to the time it takes to reach the wall. Because if the particle's lifetime is longer than the time to reach the wall, it will make it before decaying.

Wait, no. Wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau. So, if that time is greater than or equal to the time it takes to reach the wall, then the particle will survive to reach the detector. Otherwise, it decays before.

So, the fraction of particles that reach the detector is the fraction of particles whose gamma * tau is greater than or equal to the time to reach the wall, which is t = R/(beta c).

But wait, in the problem, the current setup is that with gamma =20, one third reach the walls. So, we need to find the gamma that would make two-thirds reach the walls.

Hmm. So, I think the key is to find how the fraction of particles that reach the detector depends on gamma.

Wait, perhaps the probability that a particle reaches the detector is the probability that its lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. Assuming that the decay is exponential, the probability of a particle decaying before time t is 1 - exp(-t/tau). So, the probability of it surviving is exp(-t/
