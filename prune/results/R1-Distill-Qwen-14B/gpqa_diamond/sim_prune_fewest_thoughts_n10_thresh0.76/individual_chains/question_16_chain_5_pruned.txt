Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity. Hmm, I remember that optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? And that's related to having chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry in the molecule. Let me think about each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon are Cl and two methyl groups on one side, and maybe a hydrogen and another methyl on the other? Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CR2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, actually, 1-chloro means Cl is on C1. So structure is Cl-CR2=CHCH2CH3? Wait, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is a CH2 group. Wait, wait, but wait. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be Cl attached to C1 (which is CH2Cl), and C2 has a methyl group (since it's 2-methyl). So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(R)=CHCH2CH3? Wait, but wait. Let me draw it correctly.

But-1-ene: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl. So C1 is CH2Cl, connected by a double bond to C2. C2 is CH(CH3). Because it's 2-methyl. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the actual structure is Cl-C(
