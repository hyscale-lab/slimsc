Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to visualize the structure. Benzene ring with substituents. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. So positions 1,2,3 each have a group. But wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering might depend on substituents' priority. Wait, substituents' priority according to IUPAC is based on the functional group. The nitro group has higher priority than ethoxy, which in turn is higher than the tert-butyl. So the numbering should start from the nitro as position 1? Or maybe I should think about the substituents as given.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So in the order, the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other where applicable.

Now, I'm starting with benzene. The reactions in each option use various reagents. Let's think about the steps needed.

I remember that benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. Common substituents include nitration, sulfonation, alkylation, etc. The order in which these substituents are introduced will determine their positions relative to each other because substituents direct incoming groups.

Let me think about each substituent's directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy is an activating group and is an ortho/para director. tert-Butyl is a bulky group but is a meta director since it's an alkyl group (but wait, actually, tert-butyl is a strongly activating group because it's an alkyl, which is an ortho/para director, but it's bulky so it might prefer para over ortho? Or wait, no, the directing is about where the incoming group goes, regardless of steric factors. So activating groups are ortho/para, deactivating are meta. So tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director.)

Wait, no. Wait, alkyl groups are activating (since they are electron-donating via induction), so they are ortho/para directors. But because tert-butyl is bulky, when it's added, the next substitution might be more likely in the para position than ortho, but the directing is still ortho and para. So when you have multiple substituents, the directing can be influenced by the existing groups.

So, let's think about the target: positions 1,2,3 have substituents. Let's imagine the substituents are placed in a way that each is in a certain position relative to the others.

Wait, maybe it's easier to plan the order of adding substit
