Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs due to Einstein's theory of relativity. So, the spacecraft is going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast.

The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to reach Earth. From the astronaut's perspective, how long will the trip take? Hmm, I think I need to consider both the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) and the time measured by someone on Earth.

Wait, the problem says it's from the astronaut's point of view. So I should probably use the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where τ is the proper time (the astronaut's time), t is the time measured in Earth's frame, and v is the speed of the spacecraft.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because in the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth would be length-contracted. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be less. Alternatively, Earth would see the spacecraft taking a certain time, but the astronaut's clock runs slower.

Wait, no. Proper time is the shortest time between two events (departure and arrival) and is measured in the rest frame of the traveler. So the astronaut's own time is the proper time.

Wait, let me clarify. The time experienced by the astronaut (τ) is the
