Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's see what that could mean. The molecular formula can give me an idea about the possible functional groups. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or double bond. The formula is C8H9NO. 

The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, but here it's O and N. Oh wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Let's plug in the numbers. C is 8, H is9, X is 0, N is1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe one ring and four double bonds? No, that's unlikely. Maybe two rings and a triple bond, but more probably, like a benzene ring (which is three degrees) plus a double bond and an amide or something else.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet, one proton. High up, that could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but wait, aldehydes are usually deshielded and split based on adjacent groups. 

Then 6.98 ppm, doublet with 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring. The 6.51 ppm is another doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. So, two sets of doublets in the aromatic region. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring, with two substituents. Wait, but wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be a pair of doublets indicative of a trans coupling in a para-disubstituted benzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent on a benzene ring that's causing these shifts.

Then 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests perhaps exchange with something else, like an -OH group. Maybe those are protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a phenol or an enol structure. Or maybe they are part of an enol ether or something else.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet with 2H. That's probably a methylene group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or part of an ether.

Putting it together: The molecule has an aldehyde group (9.72 ppm), aromatic rings, and an oxygen-containing group. The O in the formula could be part of a phenol or an ether or a carbonyl group. Wait, but the aldehyde is already a carbonyl.

Let me think about the structure. The high ppm aldehyde (9.7
