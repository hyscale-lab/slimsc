Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptidic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but let me think through this step by step.

So the question says that the 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right, except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason, so it's not like they're splitting each other. 

What else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Well, maybe something to do with the structure itself. Like, if the proton is in a different environment due to some kind of stereochemistry. Wait, but if it's a diastereomer, different environments could cause different shifts. Or maybe it's a question about tautomers or something else.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So same mass means same molecular weight. But why two peaks then? Oh, because they might have different retention times, which suggests different structures in the mixture. But the mass spectrum is the same, so same molecular formula. So what's the same but different?

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a lower mass than the product, right? Because the product is formed from the precursor. But in the LC-MS, the mass is the same as expected, so this probably isn't it. Unless the precursor somehow has the same mass, but that doesn't make much sense.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same mass, so the mass spec would look the same. On LC-MS, if the column is chiral, the enantiomers would separate. But if the column is achiral, they might elute at the same time. Wait, but the question says two clearly defined peaks. So if it's enantiomers, they'd have same mass, same retention time (if the column isn't chiral), but maybe the MS would show the same thing. But in the NMR, enantiomers would look the same because the peaks are identical. So in the NMR, youâ€™d see just one peak, not two for the same proton. Because enantiomers have the same environment for each proton. So that doesn't explain the two peaks.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during an amide-bond forming reaction. Hmm, double coupling? I'm not sure. Could it be that during the reaction, like in an amide formation, some kind of coupling happened that created two different products? Or maybe if the reaction didn't go to completion, or something like that. But how does that affect the NMR? If the coupling is between two protons, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. So maybe it's not that. Wait, maybe it's a case of geminal coupling or something else. Or perhaps the reaction formed two different products with the same alpha proton environment, causing two peaks. Not too sure about this one.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers
