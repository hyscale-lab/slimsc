Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different values, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula must involve the lifetime and the speed. But wait, how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters?

I think the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ. So Γ is the total decay width, which is approximately equal to ħ/τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I should double-check the exact relation. Oh right, the uncertainty principle gives Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). That makes sense because a larger width (more uncertain energy) corresponds to a shorter lifetime.

Once I have the lifetime, I need to find the velocity of the meson. To find the velocity, I can use relativistic mechanics. The energy E of the particle is given, which is 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is related to the rest mass and the kinetic energy. But wait, in particle physics, energy is often given as the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic), so I can use E² = (pc)² + (m c²)² to find the momentum p.

So let's compute the momentum. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E² = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Rearranging, (p c) = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c. Wait, no, let me write it correctly. Let's express it in natural units where c=1 for simplicity, but then remember to convert back.

Wait, no, better to write it in terms of units. Let me think. Energy E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So if I solve for pc:

pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

But E and m are in GeV, so perhaps I should convert them to the same units. Wait, but since we're dealing with ratios, maybe the units will cancel out. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the velocity beta (β = v/c) from the energy. Because βγ is E/(m c²), where γ is the Lorentz factor. So βγ = E/(m c²). Hmm, but again, I need to be careful with units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the velocity using the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. Let me think. The relativistic energy is E = γ m c², where γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²). So γ = E/(m c²). Let's compute that.

Given E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². So E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ is approximately 6.6667.

Now, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²), so sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/γ → 1 - β² = 1/(γ²) → β² = 1 - 1/(γ²) → β = sqrt(1 - 1/(γ²)).

Plugging in γ = 6.6667, which is 20/3. Let me calculate:

γ = 20/3 → γ² = (400)/(9) ≈ 44.4444.

So 1/(γ²) is 9/400 ≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking square root of that: sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So β ≈ 0.9887. That's the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.

So the velocity v is approximately 0.9887 c. Which is pretty fast, as expected.

Now, the mean decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula for decay length is L = v * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, L is in the lab frame. Since the particle is moving at velocity v, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by the Lorentz factor γ. So the lifetime in the lab frame τ_lab = γ τ. So the decay length is L = v * γ τ.

But earlier, I thought τ = ħ / Γ, but Γ is given in MeV. Wait, what units are we dealing with here? Let me make sure I get the units right.

The decay width Γ is given as 320 MeV. Planck's constant ħ has units of GeV·s when using natural units where c=1, but I might need to convert units properly.

Wait, more precisely, in particle physics, when energies are in GeV, ħc is about 197.33 MeV·fm (femtometers). But I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Alternatively, the
