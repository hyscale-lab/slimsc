Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question says that we have a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. First, let's think about the molecular formula C10H14. The degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=10, H=14, so (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degrees, which could be one ring and three double bonds, but more likely one ring and three double bonds would be too much. Wait, no. Benzene has three double bonds, so that's three degrees, and one ring, making four. So each compound is likely a substituted benzene with some substituents.

Wait, actually, each compound is C10H14. Let me calculate that. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents would add 4 carbons and 8 hydrogens, because 10-6=4, 14-6=8. So substituents are four carbons and eight hydrogens. Wait, no, each substituent is a group attached to the benzene. So for example, if the substituent is a methyl group, that's -CH3, so each adds one C and 3 H. But if the substituent is ethyl, like -CH2CH3, that's two C and five H. Wait, but in the options, the substituents are tetramethyl or diethyl.

Looking at the options, the first three are tetramethylbenzenes, so four methyl groups. Let's see: each methyl is -CH3, so four would add 4 C and 12 H. Benzene has 6 C, so total would be 6 +4 =10 C, which matches. Hydrogen: benzene has 6 H, each methyl adds 3
