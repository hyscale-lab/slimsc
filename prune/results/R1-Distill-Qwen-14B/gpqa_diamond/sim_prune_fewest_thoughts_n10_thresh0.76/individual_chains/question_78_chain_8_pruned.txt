Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges are moving, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about the scalar and vector potentials, not the fields directly.

Let me think. The scalar potential, V, is usually associated with the electric field. For a stationary charge, V is straightforward, like Coulomb's law. But when the charge is moving, things get a bit more complicated because of relativity and the retardation effect.

Wait, the problem mentions a trajectory s(t), and the vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, the field at the observation point at time t depends on the charge's state at an earlier time tr, because the effects travel at the speed of light. So, the charge's position at tr is important.

The velocity of the charge at tr is given as v. So, I think I need to consider the potentials using the retarded time. Oh right, the scalar potential in the presence of a moving charge is not just q/(4πε0 r), because the charge's velocity affects things.

I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge involves the velocity of the charge and the direction of observation. Also, I think there's a term in the denominator that includes the relative motion between the charge and the observer point. Oh wait, maybe it's something like (d c
