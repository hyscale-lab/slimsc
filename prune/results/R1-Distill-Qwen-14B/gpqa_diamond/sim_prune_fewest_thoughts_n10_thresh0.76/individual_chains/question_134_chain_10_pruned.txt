Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy change for these reactions is usually exothermic, which is why the options are all negative values, I guess.

The problem says we're mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Neutralization typically involves an acid and a base. So what's happening when we mix three solutions? Oh, maybe some of them are reacting with each other.

Let me read the question again. It says calculate the enthalpy when these are mixed. So all three are in the same mixture. Hmm, but wait, maybe first I should figure out what each component contributes in terms of acid or base.

HCl is a strong acid, right? So it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl- ions. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, I think it's a diprotic acid. So in solution, it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, right? Because the formula is Ba(OH)2, so it's Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. The reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O, and this releases heat, so the enthalpy change is negative.

But wait, there are three solutions here. Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base. Then, I can see which is in excess and how much neutralization occurs.

First, let's find the moles for each solution.

For HCl:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one H+. So moles of H+ here are 0.1.

For H2SO4:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, so H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. Since H+ is more, the OH- will be the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be 0.08 moles of H+ left.

But wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the H+ is in excess. So the neutralization reaction is between all the OH- and some of the H+.

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases a certain amount of energy. The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol, I think. Or wait, sometimes it's around -55.8 kcal/mol. Wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers. Wait,
