Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully.

Hmm, the question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. When they collide, new particles are produced. These particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, the thing is, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so the original has a Lorentz factor of 20, and one third reach. We want two-thirds to reach, so we need to find the new Lorentz factor.

I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since these particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime. So the particles can travel further before decaying.

The key here is probably the relation between the particles' lifetime, the detector's size, and the Lorentz factor. Let me think.

The proper lifetime of the particle is tau (τ). The observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by tau (γτ). The distance the particle travels before decaying is velocity (v) multiplied by the observed lifetime, so v * γτ.

But wait, the particles are ultra-relativistic, so v is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance is approximately c * γτ.

Now, the detector's radius is 30 meters. So, a particle will reach the detector's inner wall if the distance it travels is at least 30 meters.

So, the condition is c * γτ ≥ 30 meters.

But in the original case, gamma is 20, and one third reach the wall. So, perhaps the probability that a particle decays after traveling the required distance depends on the gamma.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The particles decay exponentially. The number of particles that have not decayed after time t is N = N0 * exp(-t/(τ)). But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, the time in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so t_lab = gamma * t_proper. Alternatively, the lifetime is longer by gamma,
