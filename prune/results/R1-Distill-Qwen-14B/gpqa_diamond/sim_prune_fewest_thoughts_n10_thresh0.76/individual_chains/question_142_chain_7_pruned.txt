Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Pure states are density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ><ψ|, but this one is a mixed state because it's a sum of projectors divided by 2.

Wait, so when I expand this rho, what does it look like in matrix form? Let me write it out. The |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (1,1). Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. But since it's multiplied by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. So rho is a 2x2 matrix:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, okay. Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Oh right, I think qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices correspond to points in a higher-dimensional space, but perhaps this particular rho has a specific position.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? So for a mixed state, the density matrix lies in the Bloch sphere's interior. The density matrix can be represented using the Bloch vector, which has components (x, y, z). For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices.

The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, I can express the given rho in this form and find r.

Given rho = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1| ), let's compute it. The identity matrix I is 2x2 with all diagonal elements as 1. So (I) would be:

[ [1, 0],
  [0, 1] ]

But our rho is (I) multiplied by 1/2, because:

rho = (1/2)|0><0| + (1/2)|1><1| = (1/2)(I). Because |0><0| + |1><1| is I, so yes.

So, rho = (I)/2. Comparing this with the general form (I + r·σ)/2, that would mean r·σ is zero. So r must be zero vector.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I got that right. So, if rho = [I]/2, then the equation becomes:

[I]/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I =
