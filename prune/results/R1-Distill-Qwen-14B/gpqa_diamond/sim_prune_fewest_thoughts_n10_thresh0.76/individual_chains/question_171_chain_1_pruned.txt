Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about electrophilic substitution reactions of different benzene derivatives with excess bromine. I need to arrange the substances from the least to the most yield of the para-isomer. 

Let me start by recalling what I know about electrophilic substitution. Bromine adds to the benzene ring through this process. The substituents on the ring can direct the incoming electrophile (in this case, Br+) to specific positions. If the substituent is meta-directing, the bromine will add in the meta position, but some substituents are para-directing and others are ortho/para-directing. 

Wait, no, wait. Actually, substituents can be activating or deactivating and also direct the incoming groups ortho, meta, or para. Let me think again. Electron-donating groups are activating and typically direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Electron-withdrawing groups are deactivating and often direct meta. 

Looking at each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So when bromine adds, it would go to ortho or para. Since the substituent is bulky (methyl is a bit bulky), maybe para is more favored? Or does the steric effect matter more? I think in monobromination, the major products are ortho and para, but for toluene, the para isomer might be more stable because of less steric hindrance than the ortho. So for substituent 1, the major product would be para.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's benzene with an ester group (COOEt). The ester is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would predominantly go into the meta position. So the para isomer would have a lower yield here.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group but it's ortho/para-directing because it's an activating group? Wait wait, no. Wait, chlorine is a halogen. Halogens are deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing because they can donate electrons through resonance when the lone pairs are available. Wait, is that right? So Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. So the bromine could go to ortho or para. But wait, in chlorobenzene, the major product upon monobromination is para? Or is it more ortho? I'm a bit confused. I remember that for chlorobenzene, the para position is more favored because the ortho product might be hindered by steric effects, especially since Cl is a moderately bulky group. So the main product is para.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group. It's deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would add in the meta position, meaning the para isomer would be minor. So the yield of the para isomer here is low.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. Similar to toluene but bigger. So when bromine adds, it'll go to ortho or para. But since ethyl is bulkier than methyl, the para position might be more favored because ortho would have more steric hindrance. So the para isomer is major.

6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. The carboxylic acid group is a strong electron-withdrawing group. It's deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would add in meta, leading to a small para isomer yield.

Wait, but some substituents can have different effects.
