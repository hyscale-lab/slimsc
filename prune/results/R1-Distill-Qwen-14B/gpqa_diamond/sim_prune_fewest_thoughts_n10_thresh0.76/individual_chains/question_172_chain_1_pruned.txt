Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between these levels is 1.38e-23 J. They're asking which equation relates the effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming LTE.

Alright, let me think. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the distribution of particles in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states. 

So the formula should be something like (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g are the degeneracies. But wait, in this problem, they're talking about the same iron atoms, so the g factors (degeneracy) for the two energy levels might be same? Or not? Well, the question says the excitation is twice as muchâ€”so I think they're comparing the same energy level in both stars, but I'm not sure. Wait no, the energy difference is given, so maybe each star's own energy levels have that difference.

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the considered energy levels is the same for both stars, about 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the energy levels are E and E + delta E, where delta E is 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, no, the energy difference is given as a specific value, but both stars have the same energy difference? Or each star has their own? I think it's the same for both. Because the question says "the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38e-23 J." So probably, both star_1 and star_2 have the same energy difference between the two levels we're considering.

So, the number of atoms in the excited state (n2) relative to the ground state (n1) for each star would follow the Boltzmann factor.

The ratio for star_1: (n2_1)/(n1_1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - deltaE/(k T1) )

Similarly for star_2: (
