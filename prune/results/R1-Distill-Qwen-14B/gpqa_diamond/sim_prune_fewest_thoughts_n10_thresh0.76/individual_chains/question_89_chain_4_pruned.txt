Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think each step is a reaction that changes the structure, so I'll need to figure out what each product is.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? 1,3-dibromo would have bromines on adjacent carbons maybe? When treated with KOH, especially under heat, I think it's an elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so it's likely dehydrohalogenation. But wait, dibromide elimination. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate to form an alkene.

Wait, but how? If it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when KOH is added, it would probably eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond. Which positions? Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3, right? Because each Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination would link the two. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that. Wait, but wait, the NMR of product 1 is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Oh, wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diol? Wait, no, KOH is a base, but if it's in a high enough concentration and heat, maybe it's an E2 elimination, not substitution. But 1,3-dibromide elimination would form a diene?

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane: if each Br is on adjacent carbons, like 1 and 2, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but the compound is 1,3, so maybe the structure is such that when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you form a conjugated diene? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably an -OH group? Or maybe an -OCH2- group? Or maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. Then, 2.41-2.23 (10H) which suggests a lot of equivalent protons, perhaps in a bridge structure, like adamantane. And 1.94 (2H
