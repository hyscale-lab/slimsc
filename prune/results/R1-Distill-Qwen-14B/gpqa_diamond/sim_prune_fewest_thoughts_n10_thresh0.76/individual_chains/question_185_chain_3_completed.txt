Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it says. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that Hamiltonians are related to the energy of a system, and eigenvalues give the possible energy levels.

The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So σ is a vector made up of the Pauli spin matrices. Each component σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is an arbitrary unit vector, so it's like a direction in space. ε is a constant with energy dimensions.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix depend on how you combine them. Wait, but in this case, it's the dot product of σ and n. So it's like σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H is a matrix proportional to this combination.

So I need to find the eigenvalues of H. Remember that for a spin-1/2 system, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1/2 when multiplied by something like ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. Each Pauli matrix individually has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you have a combination like σ · n, what are its eigenvalues?

Wait, I think when you have a spin operator in the direction of n, the eigenvalues are plus and minus ħ/2 times the magnitude. But wait, the magnitude here is... Let me think. The operator σ · n is a matrix. Oh, but wait, each Pauli matrix is traceless and has eigenvalues ±1. So when you have a linear combination, the eigenvalues might be ± something.

Wait, but the problem says the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So each Pauli matrix component is multiplied by the corresponding n component and then by ε. Let's write that out. σ · n is n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H is ε times that sum.

Now, the eigenvalues of σ · n. Since σ · n is a sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by n's components, what's its trace? Each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so the sum will also have trace zero. The eigenvalues must be symmetric around zero. So the eigenvalues must be λ and -λ, where λ is some value.

What's the magnitude of λ? Since the Pauli matrices are 2x2, the maximum eigenvalue for σ · n would be 1. Because each component's maximum eigenvalue is 1, and n is a unit vector. So the maximum of σ · n's eigenvalues is 1. So H has eigenvalues ε multiplied by ±1, right? Because H is ε times σ · n. So the eigenvalues of H would be ±ε.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, but when you have σ · n, it's like a direction. So the maximum eigenvalue of σ · n is 1, because n is a unit vector. So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1, so H would have eigenvalues ε*(±1) = ±ε. So the eigenvalues of H are +ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. Option C has ε multiplied by ħ/2, which reminds me of the spin operators where S = (ħ/2) σ. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as ε σ · n, not involving ħ. So without ħ, the eigenvalues are ±ε. So the correct answer should be option B.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with energy dimensions. The task is to determine the eigenvalues of \( H \).

The term \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) expands as \( n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \), where \( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \) are the Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \), and the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are also \( \pm 1 \) because \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector. This ensures that the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are symmetric and range between \( +1 \) and \( -1 \).

Since \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the Hamiltonian does not involve \( \hbar \).
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Answer: B
