Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Alright, so first, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime because of time dilation. The formula for the dilated lifetime is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

The Lorentz factor γ is given by (1 - (v²/c²))^(-1/2), but another way to write it is γ = E/(m c²), where E is the total energy of the particle. Oh wait, but since E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV, that should make things easier.

Wait, particles' energy and mass are related by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But in this case, since E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV, maybe I can just compute γ as E/(m c²)? Let me think. Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But wait, since the units are in GeV, perhaps I can just ignore the c² for now, treating E and m in compatible units.

So, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see: 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8=27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. Let's compute it more accurately. 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917 ≈ 7.92.

So γ is approximately 7.92.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s.

Calculating that: 7.92 *8 = 63.36, so τ ≈ 63.36e-16 s.

Hmm, so the lifetime in the lab frame is 6.336e-15 seconds.

But wait, why is this important? Because the particles travel some distance before decaying, and the chamber's resolution needs to be good enough to detect that.

The distance L the particle travels before decaying is given by L = v * τ. But I need to find v in terms of γ or something else.

Alternatively, another approach: the mean proper decay length is c * τ. But wait, because τ is in the lab frame, so the distance the particle travels is L = v * τ.

Wait, but perhaps using the relation between velocity and γ. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) * c.

Let me compute that. For γ=7.92, (1/γ²) is approx (1/(7.92)^2) ≈ 1/(62.72) ≈ 0.01594. So 1 - 0.01594 ≈ 0.98406. Taking square root gives sqrt(0.98406) ≈ 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992c. That's a high speed, which makes sense given the high γ.

So then L = v * τ = 0.992c * τ.

But wait, earlier calculation: τ is 63.36e-16 seconds. So τ = 6.336e-15 s.

So L = 0.992 * c * 6.336e-15 s.

Let me compute that. c is about 3e8 m/s.

So L ≈ 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.336e-15 s.

Let me compute step by step:

First, 3e8 * 6.336e-15 = (3 *6.336) * 1e8 *1e-15 = 19.008 * 1e-7 = 1.9008e-6 meters.

Multiply by 0.992: 1.9008e-6 * 0.992 ≈ 1.884e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. That's the average decay length. But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of
