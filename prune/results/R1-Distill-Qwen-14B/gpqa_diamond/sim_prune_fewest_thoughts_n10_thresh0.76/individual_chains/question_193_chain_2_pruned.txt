Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the equation would be something like N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I remember that parallax (often denoted as 'plx') is inversely related to distance. Like, as distance increases, parallax decreases. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So, plx is inversely proportional to distance, which means distance (r) is inversely proportional to plx.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, I need to express N in terms of r, and then see how N varies with r.

Let me write down what I know. 

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx = 1/r, plx is 1 divided by distance. So substituting that in, I get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Wait, so the number of stars is proportional to r^5?

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. So maybe I'm looking for the derivative of N with respect to r, or perhaps just the scaling when considering a small change in r. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the differential number of stars per distance interval.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about how N depends on plx, and plx depends on r. 

We have N = k * (plx)^-5, where k is a constant. Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k * (1/r)^-5 = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as r increases, N increases with the fifth power.

But wait, the options given are about how does the number per unit distance change. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance
