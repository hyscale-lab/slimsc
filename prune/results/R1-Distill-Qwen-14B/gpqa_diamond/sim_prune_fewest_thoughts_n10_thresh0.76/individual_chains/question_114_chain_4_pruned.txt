Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question has two parts. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to select the correct pair of reagents from the options given.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. The reaction is with NaCN. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. In such reactions, the nucleophile (like CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon.

So, when a ketone reacts with CN- (like in NaCN), it typically forms a cyanohydrin. Wait, a cyanohydrin is when the product has an alcohol (from the protonation) and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. The structure given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but with the hydroxy on the same carbon as the methyl groups. So, the product has two methyl groups, a hydroxyl, and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin formation.

But how does the reaction proceed? The general reaction for a ketone with CN- is: ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But what conditions are needed? Oh right, the reaction usually involves an acid catalyst. The acid helps to generate the nucleophilic CN- by protonating the nitrile, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Alternatively, maybe the acid is used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic.

Wait, but in the first step, the reagent is A. So for the first reaction, butan-2-one + NaCN + A → product. So A is the catalyst. Commonly, such additions (like with HCN) require an acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe in this case, A is H3O+ (which is option A and B), or perhaps something else.

Wait, let me think. When NaCN is added to a ketone, it's a nucleophilic addition. But in some cases, the reaction may require an acid to generate the necessary conditions. So perhaps A is H3O+.

Wait, but another possibility is that the reaction is done in a protic solvent with acid. So in the first step, the ketone reacts with NaCN in the presence of H3O+ as a catalyst. That would make sense because the acid would help the nucleophilic attack.

So for the first reaction, A is likely H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. It's reacting with reagent B in water to form the corresponding butanoic acid. So the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. The nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, but under certain conditions. What's the typical reagent for that?

Wait, oxidizing a nitrile to a carboxylic acid usually involves strong oxidizing agents. Common ones include KMnO4 or other strong oxidizing agents. Alternatively, under acidic conditions, maybe with H2O and an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O with something else. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. But nitriles hydrolyze under different conditions. Let me think about nitrile hydro
