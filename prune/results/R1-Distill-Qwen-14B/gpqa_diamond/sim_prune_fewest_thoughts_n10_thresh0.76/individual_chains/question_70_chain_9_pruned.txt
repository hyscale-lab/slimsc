Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions between substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I'll try to break down each reaction to identify the possible compounds involved.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents... that's a lot. Maybe A is something that reacts in an 8:1 molar ratio. I'm thinking of metals reacting with halogens, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's a reaction where a solid metal reacts with a gas to form a compound. Wait, 8 equivalents could mean 8 moles of B reacting per mole of A. So maybe A is a diatomic element and B is another diatomic? Let me think. For example, if A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl₂), but sodium reacts with chlorine in a 2:1 ratio (2 Na + Cl₂ → 2 NaCl). That's not 8. Maybe another combination.

Alternatively, maybe the product C is something like NaCl, but in a different stoichiometry. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas that reacts to form a compound. But I'm not getting it yet. Let's move on and maybe come back.

The second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So C is reacting with D in a 2:1 ratio. Hmm, C could be a compound that reacts with another gas. For example, if C is NaCl, maybe D is something else, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride, and D is a gas like Cl2 again? Or maybe D is something like O2 or another diatomic gas.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is dissolved in water, it produces A (which is solid, so maybe a metal hydroxide or something that precipitates) and two acids. Wait, strong and weak acids. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak are like CH3COOH. So, if C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid, what would that be?

Wait, for example, maybe C is sodium sulfide (Na2S). When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NaOH (strong base) and H2S (which is a weak acid). But wait, in the problem, it's the salt producing two acids. So maybe C is a sulfide or another compound that upon hydrolysis releases two different acids. Alternatively, perhaps the salt is a nitride. For example, Na3N reacts with water to produce NH3 (weak base, but maybe it's not an acid). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the acids. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps F is like HCl (strong) and G is like H2S (weak). So, if C is a sulfide salt, like Na2S. Then, Na2S + H2O → 2 NaOH (which is a base, but in the problem, it's said to reform A plus two acids. Wait, perhaps A is NaOH, but that's a solid. Or maybe A is Na, but that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2 reacts with water to produce NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. Wait, but the problem says acids F and G. So maybe the hydrolysis of C produces two acids. Let me think of another possibility. Maybe C is a metal carbonate, but that usually produces a weak acid, like CO2 (which is a weak acid in water as H2CO3). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfite or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chlorate or something else. Wait, not sure. Let me think about the initial reaction again.

First reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). Bright red product—maybe a compound with a strong color. For example, perhaps C is a metal hexachloride? Or maybe a chromium compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CuCl2, but that's blue, not red. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal like sodium, B is chlorine gas, but the ratio is 8:1, which doesn't fit the typical stoichiometry. So perhaps A is a diatomic element. Wait, perhaps A is Fe and B is Cl2. Let me see: 8 equivalents of Cl2 reacting with Fe. Fe reacts with Cl2 in a 1:3 ratio (2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3). But that would be 1.5 equivalents, not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe A is something else. Let's think about the second reaction. C + 2 D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas, like HCl, but that doesn't seem right. Or maybe E is something like sarin gas, but that's probably more complicated.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the first reaction, where A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2. The ratio is 8:1. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are consumed. So perhaps A is a metal that forms a +8 oxidation state? That's unusual. For example, Os can have +8, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a 1+ ion, and B is Cl2, so each A combines with 8 Cl atoms. So the formula would be ACl8. But I'm not sure of any common metal that forms such a compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal with a higher valency.

Alternatively, perhaps A is O2 (a gas, but the question says it's a solid). So that's not right. Maybe A is a solid metal, and B is Cl2. For example, if A is Na, but 8 Cl2 would form 8 NaCl. Hmm, but that would require 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na, which is 16 moles of Cl per Na. That would give NaCl8, which I don't think exists. Alternatively, perhaps A is Be and B is something else, but I'm not sure.

This approach isn't working yet. Let's move to another reaction. The third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So, C is likely a salt that, when it reacts with water, undergoes hydrolysis to produce two different acids. Let's think about such salts. For example, sodium sulfide (Na2S) reacts with water to produce S^2- + H2O → HS^- + OH^-, but eventually, H2S can form. But in that case, it produces a weak
