Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime they experience depends on their speed relative to the observer. Since the proper lifetime is the shortest possible, moving particles will experience time dilation. So the lifetime τ is given by τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

To find γ, I think I need the velocity or the energy of the particle. Oh, the energy is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV, so I can use the relativistic energy equation: E = γmc². But wait, let me get the units straight. Since E is in GeV, mc² would be in GeV as well because mass is given in GeV/c² (since E=mc², so GeV = (GeV/c²)*c² → GeV).

So let's compute γ. E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but since we're working in units where c is 1 (GeV, GeV/c² etc.), the equation simplifies. So γ = E/m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = approximately 7.918.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that exactly. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 × 7 is 23.87, and 3.41 × 7.9 is 27? Let me compute 3.41 ×7.9: 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.9=3.069 → total 26.939, which is almost 27. So γ is about 7.9. Close enough for our purposes.

But wait, is the energy the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic energy? Yes, E is the total energy. So yes, γ is correct as E/(m c²) → since in these units, E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so E/(m c²) = (GeV) / ( (GeV/c²) * c² ) ) → units cancel, giving dimensionless γ.

So τ, the dilated lifetime, is γ τ₀. τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.918 *8 is about 63.344 → so 63.344e-16 s → 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Wait, no, 7.918 * 8 is 63.344 → so 63.344 ×1e-16 s is 6.3344e-15 s. Hmm, okay.

Now, the next part is about the decay length. The particles will travel some distance before decaying. The decay length L is the average distance they travel before decaying, which is L = βγc τ₀, where β is v/c.

Wait, another approach: The average lifetime from the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. The speed v is βc, so the distance L is v * τ = βc γ τ₀. Alternatively, since L = βγc τ₀.

Wait, I think another way to compute this is using the velocity. Since γ = 1/√(1 - β²) → β = sqrt(1 - (1/(γ²))). Since γ is about 7.918, (1/(γ²)) is about 1/(62.71) ≈ 0.01594. So 1 - 0.01594 is 0.98406 → sqrt of that is around 0.992.

So β is approximately 0.992. Close enough. So v ≈ 0.992c.

So the distance L would be v * τ. Because τ is the lifetime in the lab frame. So L = v * τ = β c τ.

Wait, but wait, the proper lifetime is τ₀. So τ = γ τ₀. So L = v * τ = β c * γ τ₀.

Yes, that's correct. So L = β γ c τ₀.

Now, substituting the values: β is about 0.992, γ is about 7.918, c is 3e8 m/s, and τ₀ is 8e-16 s.

Let me compute L.

First, compute β γ: 0.992 *7.918 ≈ Let's calculate that. 0.992 *7 is about 6.944, 0.992 *0.918 is about 0.908? Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 7
