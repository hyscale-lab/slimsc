Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure. So, triplet and quartetâ€”maybe it's something like an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, for a triplet in NMR, that usually means the protons are next to a CH2 group. So maybe the 6H are from two equivalent CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Let's think: if you have a CH2 group that's connected to two CH3 groups, each CH3 would couple with the CH2 protons, giving a triplet. But wait, the integration is 6H, which would be two CH3 groups (each 3H). So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH3 attached two times? Like maybe an ethyl group connected to something else, but wait, maybe it's a diethyl group.

Wait, another possibility: if the triplet is from a CH2CH3 group, but if there are two equivalent such groups, that would make 6H. Or perhaps it's a geminal diethyl group? No, that's less common. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane? No, I don't think so. Let me think again.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H is probably two methyl groups (each 3H) next to a CH2. But wait, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, maybe a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's an isopropyl group. No, isopropyl would give a septet or something else. Alternatively, perhaps a diethyl group attached to something else. Or, maybe it's a gem-diethyl group attached to an oxygen, like an ether.

Wait, but let me think about the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So if it's a CH2 next to another CH2, the protons would be a quartet. Because each H in CH2 would couple with two H
