Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem says that a chemist does two reactions, Reaction 1 and Reaction 2. Each involves treating either (E)-oct-4-ene or (Z)-oct-4-ene with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Both reactions go to completion, so no partial reactions. Then the products are combined, and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. We need to find out how many peaks each chromatogram shows.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used as oxidizing agents, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions and the stereochemistry might play a role here.

So, for each starting material, Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide. Oh, right, because mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, so for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other. When epoxidation occurs, the oxygen adds across the double bond, creating an epoxide. But wait, more specifically, the mCPBA adds the oxygen in a way that the new oxygen atoms are on the same side (cis addition), right? Because the peracid attacks the double bond in a way that forms the epoxide with a particular configuration.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Epoxidation with mCPBA is stereospecific. The peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen atoms end up on the same face. So for a trans (E) double bond, the resulting epoxide would have the oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a certain configuration.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite (trans). So when mCPBA adds, the epoxide formation leads to which configuration?

Wait, the reaction of mCPBA with an alkene leads to the formation of an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are added across the double bond with the same stereochemistry as the alkene. Because mCPBA adds the oxygen as a cyclic intermediate, leading to a trans addition? Or is it a cis addition?

Wait, no. Wait, I think mCPBA adds in a way that the peracid's oxygen comes in from the same face as the alkene's substituents. Let me recall: when peracids react with alkenes, the epoxidation occurs with syn addition. Syn addition means that the oxygen atoms add to the same face of the double bond.

So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which has a trans configuration, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. Adding oxygen in a syn fashion would
