Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. From what I remember, the intrinsic angular momentum operator components are related to the Pauli matrices. So, the setup here is that Ay is equal to c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is h divided by 4π. Oh wait, I think Planck's constant is often written as h, but sometimes it's h-bar, which is h/(2π). So c here is h/(4π), which would be half of h-bar.

The matrix S is given as a 2x2 matrix. The first row is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right! The Pauli matrices. The sigma matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Wait, let me think. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], and sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Oh yeah, so S here is the sigma_y matrix. So S is sigma_y.

Wait, but in the question, Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, which is sigma_y. So I can write that as Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Now the problem says to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I need to find Ay's eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

Let me compute Ay first. Wait, sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So Ay is (h/(4π)) times that. So each element of sigma_y is multiplied by c. So Ay = [[0, -(i h)/(4π)], [(i h)/(4π), 0]].

The eigenvalues are found by solving the equation (Ay - a I) = 0. So the matrix becomes:

[ -(a)       -(i h)/(4π)      ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -(a)      ]

Wait, wait, no. The determinant is |Ay - a I| = 0. So Ay is the matrix with elements:

Ay_11 = 0, Ay_12 = -(i h)/(4π)
Ay_21 = (i h)/(4π), Ay_22 = 0

So subtracting a I, which is [[a,0],[0,a]], from Ay:

[Ay_11 - a, Ay_12]
[Ay_21, Ay_22 - a]

So the matrix becomes:

[ -a        -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a     ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h)/(4π) * -(i h)/(4π) ) ] = a² - [ (i^2
