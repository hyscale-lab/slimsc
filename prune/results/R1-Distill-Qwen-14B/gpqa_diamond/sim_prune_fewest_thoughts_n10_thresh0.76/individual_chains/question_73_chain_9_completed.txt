Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says astronaut A has a mass of 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but wait—when they talk about relative speed, do they mean the speed of one as seen from the other's frame? Because in classical mechanics, you just add or subtract the velocities, but relativistically, it's different.

Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). So let me plug in the values. Wait, but wait— astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what would B's speed be? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, relative speed is symmetric in a way, but I think the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2*v1)/c²) if you're finding the speed of B with respect to A. Or maybe, no, I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²), depending on which frame you're moving from.

Wait no, maybe it's better to think as the relative speed between A and B. Let me make sure I get the formula right. The relative speed v_rel is (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²))), assuming we're finding the speed of B as seen from A's frame. Wait, no, actually, if you're in frame S, and the other frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, then the velocity u' of an object in S' would be (u - u_obj)/(1 - u u_obj / c²). Wait, maybe I should think of it as, for the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction.

Wait, another approach: the relative velocity formula when two objects are moving with velocities u and v relative to the lab frame (same direction). The speed of the second object as seen from the first would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, in this case, A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed? Since B is moving slower than A, the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

So numerator is (-0.1c). Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is positive, it's 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So that would be the relative speed between the two, which is option C or D, looking at the options.

Wait the options for v_rel are 0.14c in C and D. Now I need to compute the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each astronaut, we'll compute their gamma and multiply by their respective masses.

So astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. So gamma for A is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So A's energy is 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma for B is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So B's energy is 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So E is about 5.96, so the correct option for energy is C or B. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc².

So the relative speed calculation gave me 0.14c, which matches both C and D. The energy calculation led to about 5.96, so option C is correct.

Wait, but wait one more thing: when adding relativistic energies, do we consider the kinetic energy or the total energy? The question says total energy of the system, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, let me recheck the energy calculations:

A: 2m * gamma(0.6c) = 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m c².

B: 3m * gamma(0.5c) = 3m * (1/ sqrt(1 - 0.25)) = 3m * (1/sqrt(0.75)).

What's 1/sqrt(0.75)? Let's compute sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So 3 * 1.1547 = about 3.464.

So 2.5 + 3.464 is 5.964, which rounds to 5.96 mc².

So the correct answer would be option C: v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Wait looking at the options again:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Option B: v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96. So no, C is correct.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The formula for the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

Since speed is positive, \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = 2m \cdot 1.25c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For astronaut B (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = 3m \cdot 1.1547c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2\).

This matches **Option C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\).

### Final Answer
ANSWER: C
