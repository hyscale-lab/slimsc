Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But in this case, the medium is moving.

So the glass is moving at velocity v. How does that affect the light's speed as observed? I'm a bit confused. Do I just add the velocities? Like in special relativity, you can't just add them because you have to consider the frame of reference.

Wait, no, this isn't necessarily a relativistic problem because the velocity v is probably much less than the speed of light. So maybe I can use the Galilean transformation here.

In Galilean relativity, velocities add up. So if the medium is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, then the speed of the light relative to the lab frame would be the speed in the medium plus v.

Wait, let me think again. The light's speed in the medium is c/n. So normally, in the medium's rest frame,
