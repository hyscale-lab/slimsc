Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we mix 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, there are three components here, so I need to think about how they all react together.

First, I'll probably need to calculate the moles of each substance. Moles are calculated by Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters). Let's see:

For CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is a weak acid:
Moles = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl is a strong acid:
Moles = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.
Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Oh, and since each gives 2 OH-:
Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's think about the reaction. The HCl and Ba(OH)2 are both strong, so they'll react quickly. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't react as much unless in a neutralization.

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, the H+ from the acid will react with the OH- from the base to form water. So the H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH, but CH3COOH only partially ionizes.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely ionize. So the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

So let's find the net moles of H+ or OH- after mixing. Because H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

Total H+ available: from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but wait: CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully ionize. Hmm. But wait another thing: when you mix all these solutions, the strong acid (HCl) and strong base (Ba(OH)2) will react first, and then the weak acid (CH3COOH) will come into play if there's any excess H+ or OH- left.

Wait, maybe I should proceed in steps. First, calculate the total H+ from HCl and the total OH- from Ba(OH)2, and see which is in excess.

So, HCl gives
