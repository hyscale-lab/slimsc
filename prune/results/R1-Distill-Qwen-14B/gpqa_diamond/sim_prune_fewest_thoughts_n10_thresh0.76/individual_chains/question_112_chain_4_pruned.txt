Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities require the state to have a norm of 1. Wait, right, the state is proportional, so I should compute the normalization factor.

So, the state can be written as |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 is (1+i) and c2 is (2-i). Hmm, the normalization condition is |c1|^2 + |c2|^2 = 1, but since it's proportional, I need to find the coefficient to make that sum equal to 1.

Calculating the mod squared of c1: |1+i|^2 is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For c2: |2-i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1=5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because (1/sqrt(7))² times (2+5) = 1. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix Aij. A is defined as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. Wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out.

Since the basis is |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of Sz, the operator A would have elements:
- A_11 =0, A_12= ħ/2
- A_21= ħ/2, A_22=0
So the matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. That looks familiar; this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So this operator is (ħ/2) σx. 

Wait, but the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. The eigenstates of σx are the same as the eigenstates of the X operator. Oh wait, no, the eigenstates of σx are the same as the eigenstates of A, because A is a multiple of σx. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σx, which are the superpositions (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Let me confirm that.

Yes, σx has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates of A are these two states, since A
