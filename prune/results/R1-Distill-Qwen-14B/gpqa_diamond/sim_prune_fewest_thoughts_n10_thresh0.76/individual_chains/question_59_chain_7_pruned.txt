Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The problem says that we have three different solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to determine the pH of the resulting mixture.

Wait, CH3COOH is acetic acid, a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, I think. So when you mix an acid and a base, they should neutralize each other. But since there are two acids and one base, maybe the base will neutralize some of the acids first?

Let me plan this out. I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base, then see how they react.

So, for each solution, I'll calculate the moles:

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters).

For CH3COOH:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L.
Molarity is 0.1 M. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
400 mL is 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates completely in water into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^- per formula unit. So the moles of OH^- from Ba(OH)2 will be 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the acids are HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl^- ions. So 0.08 moles of HCl gives 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But in solution, it does donate some H+ ions. But wait, in the presence of a strong base, maybe the H+ ions from HCl would react first with the OH- from the base.

So, the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, the reaction between acid and base is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So first, the strong acid HCl will donate H+ which will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.
