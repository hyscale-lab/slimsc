Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in different organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a compound has chiral centers. But wait, sometimes even if there are chiral centers, like if there's a plane of symmetry or some kind of internal compensation, the compound might not be chiral overall. So I need to check each compound one by one.

Let me go through each compound listed:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be ClCH2CH(CH3)CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is Cl attached to the first carbon. So structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, I think I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. So it's Cl-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. The substituents are 1-chloro and 2-methyl. So the first carbon (CH2) has Cl, and the second has a methyl. So structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is four carbons. So 1-chloro is on C1, which is CH2Cl, and C2 has a methyl. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but butene is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl. And 2-methyl would be a CH(CH3). Wait, that can't be right because the structure would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2? But that's only three carbons. Oh, wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about whether this compound has a stereocenter. For a double bond, (Z) configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond. So in this case, the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl and CH2 on either side? Wait, C1 is connected to Cl
