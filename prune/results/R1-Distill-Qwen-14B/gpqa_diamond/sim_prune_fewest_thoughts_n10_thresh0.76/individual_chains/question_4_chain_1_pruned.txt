Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations... right, they are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me think about each one. The first equation is Gauss's law for electric fields, which relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed. The second is Gauss's law for magnetism, which says that the magnetic flux through a closed surface is always zero, implying that there are no isolated magnetic monopoles. Oh, right, because in our universe, you can't have a single north or south pole—they come in pairs.

So if in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that must change something. Oh yeah, the second equation would have to be different. Because Gauss's law for magnetism (equation 2) would no longer hold. Instead of the divergence of B being zero, it would be equal to some term related to magnetic charge density.

Wait, so the second Maxwell equation is ∇·B = 0. If there are monopoles, that equation should change. I think the modified equation would be ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 is definitely different.

Then the other equations. Faraday's law (equation 3) relates the curl of the electric field to the time derivative of the magnetic field. But does having monopoles change that? I'm not so sure. Because Faraday's law is about induced electric fields due to changing magnetic fields. I think that equation remains the same unless magnetic current is involved. Wait, but equation 4 is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which involves the displacement current. That equation might not change because it's more about how electric fields and currents create magnetic fields.

Wait another thought: What about the other equations. The third equation is about the curl of E. If we have magnetic monopoles, would that affect the curl of E? Hmm, maybe not directly. Because Faraday's law is about the changing B field creating E fields. So that's equation 3, which probably stays the same.

So what changes is equation 2. But looking at the options, the question says which equations are different. So
