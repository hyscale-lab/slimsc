Okay, so I have this question about immunology, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to break it down. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that someone tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and fed them to mice. Then, when they did in vivo imaging, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, they saw high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm, so the scenario involves rotavirus, GFP tagging, and the immune response in mice. I remember that rotavirus is a pathogen that causes gastroenteritis, and it's known for infecting the small intestine. The inner capsid proteins are probably part of the virus structure, and GFP is used to track them.

The mice received the tagged proteins via oral gavage. So, the proteins would enter the stomach. The problem mentions that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is HCl, right? So it's probably breaking down some of the GFP-tagged proteins. But others made it through the stomach acid and got into the intestines, but then got entangled in the mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include things like Peyer's patches, lymph nodes, and the spleen. Peyer's patches are located in the small intestine and are part of the immune system, acting as sites for immune cell surveillance.

They found the fluorescent Peyer patches, which suggests that the tagged proteins made it there. Then, they isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in an immune context are likely B cells or T cells that are activated and dividing. The sequencing showed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. High variability in variable regions is a hallmark of an immune response, perhaps due to processes like somatic hypermutation or V(D)J recombination.

Wait, so what processes are involved in immune responses? Let's think.

VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the B cell receptor. This happens early on and leads to the generation of a diverse set of B cells. However, this process is during the maturation of B cells, not necessarily during a response to an antigen.

Somatic hypermutation is a process that happens after B cells are activated, typically in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. Here, B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This helps in fine-tuning the immune response to specific antigens, leading to higher affinity antibodies.

Class switching recombination, also known as isotype switching, is when the class of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. This doesn't affect the variable regions but the constant regions. So, the variable heavy chain sequencing wouldn't show much in terms of variability from class switching. Also, the question focuses on variable heavy chain genes, so this might not be the answer.

So the options are A) somatic hypermutation, D) VDJ recombination.

The key is to figure out when these processes occur. The question involves an immune response to the rotavirus proteins. The mice were fed the proteins, which would be processed by the digestive system. Some got to the Peyer's patches, which are part of the mucosal immune system, particularly the GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue).

In the Peyer's patches, B cells encounter the antigen. Activated B cells then go through processes like proliferation and differentiation. In the germinal centers, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation. This hypermutation increases the diversity of the antibodies, as each cell's BCR (antigen receptor) might have slight variations, leading to high variability in the variable regions when sequenced.

VDJ recombination happens earlier, during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. So if you're seeing high variability after an immune response, it's more likely to be somatic hypermutation.

So in this case, the cells isolated are proliferating, which would be in germinal centers. Therefore, the process is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The question involves an immune response to GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus in mice. After oral gavage, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, while others reached the Peyer patches, where they were isolated from proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes revealed high variability, suggesting an immune process that increases diversity.

To analyze the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, leading to mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors. It increases diversity and affinity of antibodies, aligning with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves the complement system attacking pathogens but does not directly affect the variability of the variable heavy chain genes. It is unrelated to the observed phenomenon.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions. Since the question focuses on variability in the variable heavy chain genes, this is not relevant.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in the variable regions. However, it happens before the immune response and is not responsible for the observed high variability in this context.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the proliferating cells at the Peyer patches is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in germinal centers. This process fine-tunes the immune response and increases antibody diversity.

Answer: A
