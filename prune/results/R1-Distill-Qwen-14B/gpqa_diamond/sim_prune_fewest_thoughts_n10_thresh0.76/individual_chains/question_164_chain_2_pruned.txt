Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass. The question is asking me to find out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Both systems have eclipses with certain periods, and there's some radial velocity data given. Right, I remember that radial velocity curves can help determine the masses of the stars in a binary system.

Wait, the periods are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Oh, but wait, the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. So the orbital period of the binary system is the same as the eclipse period, I think. Because in a binary, the stars orbit each other, so when one passes in front of the other from our point of view, we get an eclipse. So the time between eclipses is the orbital period.

The radial velocity (RV) data shows sinusoidal variations in each star's velocity. The amplitude of these variations depends on the mass of the companion. Oh right, the more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity amplitude because it's orbiting a closer center of mass. Wait, or is it the larger mass has a smaller amplitude? Let me think. The center of mass (barycenter) is the balance point between the two masses. So a more massive star would have a smaller orbit around the barycenter. So the radial velocity amplitude (which is the maximum speed) would be inversely proportional to the mass of that star.

Wait, the formula I vaguely remember is that the RV amplitude K is given by (M2/M1 + M2) * (other terms). Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function. Oh, right, the mass function relates the observed radial velocity semi-amplitude to the mass of the companion. The formula is something like (M2³ sin³i) / ( (M1 + M2)² ) = some function involving the period and the velocity.

But wait, in this problem, both stars in each system are showing their own RV variations. So for system_1, the two stars have velocities with amplitudes 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, 15 and 10 km/s.

Wait, so in each system, the two stars have different velocities. Because the more massive star moves slower. So the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses. So for system_1: v1 = 10, v2 =5. So the mass ratio q = M1/M2 = v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2 in system_1? Or wait, no, because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if star A has velocity v1 and star B has v2, then M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A. So in system_1, M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M2 is twice M1.

Wait, let me get that straight. Suppose M1 is more massive than M2. Then M1's velocity would be smaller. So if M1 has velocity 5, M2 might have 10. Then M1/M2 = velocity of M2 / velocity of M1 = 10/5=2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me think again.

The center of mass requires that M1 * v1 = M2 * v2. Because their momentum vectors must cancel each other. So M1*v1 = M2*v2. So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So in system_1, v1 is 10, v2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is 0.5 times M2. So M2 is twice as massive as M1.

Wait, but the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2. If M2 is twice M1, so M1 + 2*M1 = 3 M1. So total mass is 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So M1' / M2' = v2' / v1' = 10/15 = 2/3. So M1' is 2/3 of M2'. So M2' is 1.5 times M1'.

The total mass for system_2 is M1' + M2' = (2/3 M2') + M2' = (5/3) M2'.

But wait, I might be getting the star indices wrong. Because in system_1, which star is which? Well, the velocities are given as the two stars, but probably in each system, the stars are labeled star A and star B, with their respective velocities. So in system_1, star A's velocity is 10, star B's is 5. So the mass ratio is M_A/M_B = 5/10 = 0.5.

So, M_A = 0.5 M_B. So M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B = 1.5 M_B. So the total mass of system_1 is 1.5 M_B.

Similarly, system_2 has star A's velocity 15, star B's 10. So M_A / M_B = 10/15 = 2/3. So M_A = (2/3) M_B. So total mass is (2/3 M_B) + M_B = (5/3) M_B.

Wait, but how do I compare the masses of the two systems? Let's think.

Wait, perhaps the periods can be used to relate the masses. Because the orbital period is determined by the masses and the separation. Hmm, Kepler's third law comes into play here.

The formula for binary stars: (M1 + M2) * P² = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, the formula can be written in terms of the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, another approach: the velocity amplitudes are related to the orbital motion. The velocity of each star is given by v = (2π a sin i) / P. But wait, a is the semi-major axis, but in a binary system, a is the distance between the two stars. So each star's velocity is proportional to their semi-major axis (their distance from the center of mass) times the orbital frequency. But perhaps
