Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that two stars have the same mass, each is similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. Using the RV method, they detected the planets. The first planet caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and the second caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift relates to the star's velocity towards or away from us. The bigger the shift, the higher the velocity.

But how does this relate to the orbital period? Oh right, the orbital period is the time it takes for the planet to orbit the star, which is the same as the star's wobble period. So the same period for planet and star.

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is involved here. The formula is something like K = (v * sin i) where v is the star's velocity, but wait, what determines that velocity? Oh, the formula for K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (1 AU)^0.5 )

Wait, maybe another approach. I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but I might be mixing up the exponents. Alternatively, the formula might be K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between K, the semi-amplitude, and the period. I think that K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, but I'm not entirely sure. Or wait, perhaps K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Let me think.

Another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ] / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (2 pi)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I can relate K to the period. Let's see, rearranging the formula to solve for P.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler way is to consider that for two planets where the star mass M* is the same (since both stars have same mass as Sun), and the planet masses are same (Neptune-like), then the ratio of their K values relates inversely to the cube root of the ratio of their periods.

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p)
