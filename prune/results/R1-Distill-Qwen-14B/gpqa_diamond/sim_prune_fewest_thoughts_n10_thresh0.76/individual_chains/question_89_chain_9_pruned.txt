Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to make product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, 1,3-dibromo would have Br's on adjacent carbons in a bridge structure. Heating with KOH would likely form a double bond between those two carbons, making an adamantylene or something similar.

Wait, more accurately, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? Because each Br is on a bridgehead, so elimination would form a double bond. So product 1 is likely adamantane with a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on adjacent bridgeheads. Eliminating two HBr would form a double bond there, making 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

But looking at the NMR data of product 1: the 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but product 1 is from elimination, which usually forms an alkene. So why the C=O?

Oh wait, maybe I was wrong. Another possibility is that KOH in such conditions could cause a substitution reaction, but not elimination. Wait, no, with two adjacent bromines, elimination is more likely. But if elimination leads to an alkene, then where is the carbonyl coming from?

Wait, maybe the base isn't just causing elimination. Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes a different type of reaction. Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's an example of a pinacol-like elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more like a nucleophilic substitution, but with two bromines adjacent, perhaps leading to an epoxide? No, that would require something else.

Wait, wait, maybe the KOH is causing the elimination of two HBr molecules, but not just forming a double bond. Because the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests formation of a ketone or ester. Hmm, but elimination would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So maybe it's a different process.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol ether or something else.

Wait, let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two non-adjacent bridgeheads? Or adjacent? Wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So
