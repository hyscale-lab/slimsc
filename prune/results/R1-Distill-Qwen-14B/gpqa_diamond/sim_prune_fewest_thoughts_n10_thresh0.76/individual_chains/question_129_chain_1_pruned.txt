Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions leading from compound A to E, and we have to identify compound E based on the given information and options. There are also some hints provided, so I should pay attention to those.

First, let me outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B undergoes reduction with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints given:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are four different cyclic ketones: A, B, C, D.

Let me think about each part.

Starting with the first reaction: A reacts with HCN to form B. HCN is typically a nucleophile. When it reacts with a ketone or aldehyde, it forms a cyanohydrin. Wait, but wait: if A is a ketone, then adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, same thing. But sometimes, HCN can also be used in other reactions, like in the formation of nitriles from alcohols, but that's more with HCN and a base, like in the Stephen reduction maybe. Hmm, but more likely, if A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would add across the carbonyl group to form a cyanohydrin.

Wait, but looking at the second step: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. So if B is a cyanohydrin, which has a ketone and a nitrile group, then reducing that could affect each functional group. Wait, H2 with Pd is a hydrogenation catalyst. The nitrile group (CN) is not
