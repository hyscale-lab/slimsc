Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

So the question is about why there's no green signal when visualizing the mice. The setup involves a bicistronic vector with a ligand and receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter often used for transgene expression. The receptor has an IRES element upstream, which typically allows it to be expressed as a separate transcript from the same mRNA, so that's a way to have two genes in one construct.

Looking at the vector: the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, followed by mCherry, but there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). So the ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop would prevent any further expression downstream unless the stop is excised. Then, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, with a different stop cassette, lox2272. So the ligand and receptor are each under separate regulatory elements but in the same construct.

They used a bicistronic vector with loxP sites, which makes me think about Cre/Lox recombination. The mice are homozygous for this construct. Then they crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice, which are hemizygous. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is likely expressed in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes or other glial cells.

When they breed the mice, the Cre should recognize the loxP sites. The ligand is under CBA, which is constitutive, I believe. The receptor has an IRES, which is internal ribosome entry site, allowing it to be co-translated from the same mRNA as the ligand but as a separate ORF.

Wait, the bicistronic construct uses loxP and lox2272. LoxP is a 34 bp site, and lox2272 is a variant. The Cre recombinase will excise the stop cassettes. The ligand and mCherry are in one cassette, and the receptor and eGFP in another. So when Cre is present, it should remove the stop cassettes, allowing both the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So in the Western blot, they expected to see both proteins, but maybe in the mice, the expression depends on Cre.

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct. The cross is with SOX10-Cre hemizygous. SOX10-Cre would express Cre in certain cells. So in the offspring, the Cre would be present, and the Cre should recombine the lox sites.

In the construct, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. So when Cre is active, it would delete the stop casset
