Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some mutations. Let me try to break it down. So, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the mutants. The problem is to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so the idea is that the gene product (probably a protein) is causing the anti-nutritional compound. To eliminate it, the gene's function needs to be disrupted. That can happen through a few mechanisms: maybe a frameshift causing a premature stop codon, or a missense mutation that disrupts the enzyme's function, or perhaps a nonsense mutation.

Looking at the sequences given. The intact gene's first part is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Each mutant has a change in the first exon area.

Let me look at each mutant.

Mutant 1: The sequence starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGT... Wait, comparing to the wild type, in the first part, the wild type is TTTCTCGC. So in the mutant, it's TCTACGC. Wait, let me count the letters. Maybe the mutation is a substitution. Let me see:

Original: positions 4-10: T T C T C G C

Mutant 1: T C T A C G C

Wait, so the fourth base changes from T to C? Or maybe the fifth? Let me check:

Original sequence: positions maybe around there. Alternatively, perhaps the first part is ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT... So, in mutant 1, the CT C becomes CT A? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution in the first exon causing a change in the amino acid.

But regardless, I need to look for which mutation would disrupt the gene's function.

Mutant 2: Looking at its sequence, the first part is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACT... So, the wild type has CGCT, I think. Wait, the wild type's sequence is ...TTCTCGCTGGT..., so the CGCT part in the wild type. In mutant 2, maybe it's AAGCT. So perhaps a substitution from CG to AG? Or perhaps a larger change. Let me see, the wild type had CT CGC TGG, so maybe in mutant 2, the CGC becomes AGCT? Not sure. Wait, maybe that's an insertion or deletion? No, because all sequences are same length, so it's a substitution.

Mutant 3: The sequence starts with ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTC... So, the wild type was TTTCTC, so here it's TTTTAC. So, perhaps a substitution from C to A at a certain position. Also, looking further, in the wild type, maybe the next part is GGTACT, but in mutant 3, it's GTGTCA. So in the middle, maybe a substitution from T to C in one position. So perhaps two substitutions here.

Mutant 4: The sequence is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTG... Comparing to the wild type, the wild type after TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT... So in mutant 4, the ...GCTGGT... becomes ...GCTACT... So perhaps a substitution from GGT to ACT? Or maybe an insertion? Wait, the wild type has GGTACT, and mutant 4 has ACTTCT? Let me see. Wait, the wild type is ...GGTACTTCTGT..., and mutant 4 is ...GCTACTTCTGT... Hmm, maybe a substitution in the middle. Let me count the letters.

Alternatively, perhaps in mutant 4, a segment is changed. Let me see: the wild type has GCTGGTACT, and mutant 4 has GCTACT. So perhaps a substitution of T for the A in ACT? Or perhaps a larger change.

But what's important is whether the mutation would disrupt the gene's function. For that, a premature stop codon is effective. So looking for a frameshift or a stop codon.

Looking at each:

Mutant 1: Let's look at the amino acids. The original sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then TTT is Phe, next CT is His (CAT is His, but wait, the codon is TTTCT... Wait, perhaps the exons are in the same reading frame.

Wait, perhaps each mutation is in the coding sequence, so any change could affect the protein.

Mutant 1: The sequence changes from TTCTCGC to TCTACGC. Let me see the codons. The wild type would have TTCTCGC as three codons: TTC (Phe), TCG (Ser), C G something? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think in triplets.

Wild type: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

Mutant1: ...TTT CT A CGC TGG... Wait, maybe the third codon is changed. For example, in the wild type, the third codon is CTC (Leu), but in mutant1, it's TAC (Tyr)? Wait, let me see:

Wild: positions 1-3: ATG (start)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: CT C (so next codon is CTC (Leu))
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
16-18: ACT (Thr)
19-21: TCT (Ser)
...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TT...

Wait, let me parse it as triplets:
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG TAC TT...

Wait, no, looking at the mutant1 sequence: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC T... So, the third codon in the wild type was CTC (Leu), and in mutant1, it's CT A (so the third codon becomes CTA (Leu again? Because CTA is also Leu, so same amino acid. Hmm. Then the next codon is CGC which is Arg. Wild type was GCT (Ala). So mutant1 has CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala). So that's a substitution from Ala to Arg. Then TGG is same as wild type (Trp). So this is a missense mutation. Not a frameshift, so the reading frame is maintained. So it changes an Ala to Arg. Probably not a null mutation; the protein may still function, but perhaps less active. But if the compound is being made, maybe that's not enough.

Mutant2: sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Breaking into triplets: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC T...

So first codon same: ATG (Met)

Second: TTT (Phe)

Third: CTA (Leu)

Fourth: AGC (Ser)

Fifth: TGG (Trp)

Sixth: TAC (Tyr)

So wild type at fourth codon was GCT (Ala), but mutant2 has AGC (Ser). So another substitution. So missense again. Again, not a frameshift.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTC... so triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...

Wild type was ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So first three: same (Met Phe).

Fourth codon in wild: CTC (Leu); in mutant3, it's TAC (Tyr). So substitution from Leu to Tyr.

Fifth codon wild: GCT (Ala); mutant3 has GCT same? Then sixth: GGT same, then GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So after that, perhaps another change.

So again, a few substitutions, but no frameshift. So perhaps altering some amino acids but not causing a stop.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT G...

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So first three: same (Met Phe).

Fourth codon: wild is CTC (Leu); mutant4 has GCT (Ala). Then fifth codon: wild is GCT (Ala) → mutant4 has ACT (Thr). Sixth codon: wild is GGT (Gly) → mutant4 has CTG (Leu). 

Wait, but wait, looking at the sequence, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) in mutant4. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the codons wrong. Let me write the wild type and mutant4 sequences:

Wild type first part: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Mutant4: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGT...

So, the wild type triplet after ATG TTT is CTC, then GCT, then GGT, then ACT, then TCT, etc.

Mutant4: after ATG TTT is TTA CGC TAC T...

Wait, the mutant4 sequence from the question is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, the fourth codon is TAC (Tyr), fifth is GCT (Ala), sixth is ACT (Thr), seventh is TCT (Ser), then GTG (Val), etc.

In the wild type, the fourth codon is CTC (Leu), fifth is GCT (Ala), sixth is GGT (Gly), seventh is ACT (Thr), etc.

So in mutant4, the sequence from the fourth codon is TAC GCT ACT, so the fourth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), fifth is same (GCT), sixth is same (ACT?), no, wait, wild type sixth codon is GGT (Gly) in position 13-15, and in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr) in position 13-15?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me write out the first 18 bases.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, the fourth codon in wild is CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a substitution. But then fifth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), same as mutant4. Sixth codon in wild is GGT (Gly), in mutant4, next is ACT (Thr). So perhaps a substitution from Gly to Thr. Hmm, but that's still a missense mutation.

Wait, but looking further, perhaps a frameshift? No, because all the sequences are same length, so it's substitution only.

Wait, but in the question, the mutants have changes in the first exon. Exons are the coding regions, so any substitution there could affect the protein.

The key is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene function, either by creating a premature stop codon or by completely altering the protein structure.

Looking for a nonsense mutation which introduces a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA).

Let me check each mutant:

Mutant1: Let's look for stop codons in the sequence.

Mutant1's sequence: ...TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT G... So the first few codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CT A (Leu?), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. No stop codon here.

Mutant2: ...CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT... AGC is Ser, TGG Trp, TAC Tyr. No stop codon.

Mutant3: ...TAC GCT GGT GTC... TAC is Tyr, GCT Ala, GGT Gly, GTC Val. No stop.

Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... TAC Tyr, GCT Ala, ACT Thr, TCT Ser, GTG Val. No stop codon yet.

Wait, what about later in the sequence? The wild type ends with ...TGA, which is a stop codon (the last three bases are TGA).

Wait, looking at the original gene's sequence: ...GTCGT…TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So in all the mutants, the TGA is still at the same place, as all end with TGA.

So the only way a premature stop occurs is if a TGA, TAG, or TAA appears earlier.

Looking through each mutant's sequence:

Mutant1's sequence: ...CGC TGG TAC TT... so no TGA before the end.

Mutant2: ...CGA GCT ... No.

Mutant3: ...GTC GGT ... No.

Mutant4: ...ACT TCT GTG ... No.

Hmm, then maybe none of the mutations introduce a premature stop. But perhaps one of them causes a frameshift, leading to a different reading frame and a premature stop.

Wait, but the sequences are same length, so it's substitutions, not indels.

Alternatively, perhaps a missense mutation that completely disrupts the enzyme's active site.

Wait, but the anti-nutritional compound is being synthesized by the gene. To eliminate it, the enzyme that makes it must be nonfunctional.

So the best way is to disrupt the gene so that the enzyme isn't made or is nonfunctional.

Another approach is that perhaps the mutations are in the promoter region, but the question says the target gene in all mutant lines was sequenced and changes are in the first exon. Exons are coding regions, so mutations are in the coding sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps some mutations lead to the production of a truncated protein (early stop), which might not function.

Wait, but in the sequences I don't see any early stop codons.

Wait, perhaps looking more carefully. Let me look at the exact sequences.

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, looking at the sequences, perhaps I can spot where the changes occur.

Comparing the sequences:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGC GCT GGT ACT... 

Wait, perhaps in the wild type, it's TTT CTC GCT, and in mutant1, it's TTT CT A CGC. So the third codon is CTC (Leu) in wild, and in mutant1, it's CT A (so third codon is CTA, which is Leu again). Then the fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), and in mutant1, it's CGC (Arg). So the codon changed from GCT to CGC. So that would change the amino acid from Ala to Arg. So a missense mutation.

Similarly, wild type has ACT (Thr) in the sixth codon, and in mutant1, it's same as wild? Or not. Hmm, but no stop codon.

Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT...

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, the third codon in wild is CTC (Leu), in mutant2, it's CTA (Leu). So same amino acid. The fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), mutant2 has AGC (Ser). So substitution from Ala to Ser. So again, a missense.

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Third codon: wild CTC (Leu) → mutant3 TAC (Tyr) → substitution. So amino acid change from Leu to Tyr. Fourth codon in wild is GCT (Ala), same in mutant3. Fifth codon in wild is GGT (Gly) → mutant3 has GTC (Val). So substitution from Gly to Val. So two changes here, but no stop codon.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Third codon: wild CTC (Leu) → mutant4 TAC (Tyr). Another substitution. Fourth codon wild GCT (Ala) → same as mutant4. Fifth codon wild GGT (Gly) → mutant4 has ACT (Thr). So substitution from Gly to Thr.

So, all four mutants have substitutions, but none introduce a premature stop codon. So how to decide which would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound?

Perhaps the most disruptive mutation is one that changes a critical amino acid in the enzyme's active site, rendering it nonfunctional. Alternatively, a mutation that creates a splice site issue, but since the mutations are in the first exon, maybe splicing isn't affected because introns are later.

Wait, the gene has five exons and four introns, but the mutations are in the first exon. So perhaps splicing isn't directly affected.

Another thought: perhaps the mutations cause a large change in the protein structure, leading to loss of function.

Looking at each mutation:

Mutant1 changes codon 4 from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). Alanine is a small, nonpolar amino acid; arginine is large and positively charged. So this substitution could significantly alter the protein's structure or function.

Mutant2 changes codon4 from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). Both are polar but different. Ala is less polar, Ser is hydroxyl. This change could affect the structure but perhaps not completely disable the enzyme.

Mutant3 changes codon3 from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Leu is hydrophobic, Tyr is aromatic and has a hydroxyl group. This substitution might disrupt the structure more, but it depends on the position.

Mutant4 changes codon3 from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and codon5 from GGT (Gly) to CTG (Leu). Gly is very flexible, Leu is hydrophobic. So changing Gly to Leu might disrupt structure.

But without knowing the exact function of the gene, it's hard to say which substitution would be most effective.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for a frameshift, but since the lengths are the same, it's substitution only.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the key is that the anti-nutritional compound is a product of the gene's enzyme. If the gene is knocked out, the compound won't be synthesized. So any mutation that disrupts the gene product would be beneficial.

So the best options are those that cause a loss-of-function mutation, perhaps via a premature stop. But none of the mutants introduce a stop codon in their sequences.

Wait, but perhaps I missed something. Let me check each mutant's sequences again for any stop codons.

Looking at mutant4's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So after the start, the codons are:

1. ATG (Met)
2. TTT (Phe)
3. TAC (Tyr)
4. GCT (Ala)
5. ACT (Thr)
6. TCT (Ser)
7. GTG (Val)
8. GAT (Asp)
9. GAA (Glu)
...

No TGA, TAG, or TAA before the end.

Mutant3: ...ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ... So codons after start:

Met, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Gly, Val... No stops.

Mutant2: ...AGC TGG TAC TCT... AGC is Ser, TGG is Trp, TAC is Tyr, TCT is Ser. No stops.

Mutant1: ...CGC TGG TAC TT... CGC is Arg, TGG Trp, TAC Tyr. No stops.

Hmm, so none of the mutations introduce a premature stop. Then, perhaps the correct answer is the one that changes the most critical part of the gene, like the start codon or the beginning of the coding region.

Wait, the first codon is ATG in all, so no changes there.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation is present but I missed it. Let me look again.

Wait, the wild type ends with TGA, which is a stop. All the mutants end with TGA as well.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence again: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

So the sequence after the start is: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... Then it goes on to ...CGT … TGA.

Wait, perhaps in the middle, there's a TGA?

Looking at the sequence, after GTG GAT GAA, does any triplet form a stop?

Mutant4: ...GTG GAT GAA ... So codons are Val, Asp, Glu. No stop.

Wait, perhaps in another part, but I don't see it.

So without a premature stop, perhaps the best bet is a mutation that disrupts a critical region of the gene.

Another approach: looking for a silent mutation or synonymous change. But that's not likely to affect the compound.

Alternatively, perhaps a missense mutation in a critical region like the active site.

But without knowing the structure, it's tricky.

Wait, another possibility: the question asks which mutation would eliminate the compound. So perhaps the gene product is an enzyme that produces the compound. If the enzyme is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

So, any mutation that disrupts the enzyme's function would be good. The most effective would be a mutation that causes a frameshift, but since all are substitution, perhaps the best is a missense in a critical position.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations disrupts a critical domain, like the active site.

Looking at the sequences, perhaps mutant4 changes two codons: TAC and ACT (from wild type's CTC and GCT). But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about another angle. The anti-nutritional compound is made by this gene, so the gene encodes an enzyme that produces it. So if the enzyme's structure is altered beyond function, the compound won't be made.

Which mutation would most likely cause this? The one that changes the most in the primary structure.

Looking at the mutations:

Mutant1 changes CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala). So a big change.

Mutant2 changes AGC (Ser) from GCT (Ala). So also a change.

Mutant3 changes TAC (Tyr) from CTC (Leu), and GTC (Val) from GGT (Gly). So two changes.

Mutant4 changes TAC (Tyr) from CTC (Leu), and ACT (Thr) from GGT (Gly).

Which of these would have a more drastic effect? Gly to Thr is a bigger change than some others, perhaps.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a frameshift, but I don't think so because the length is same.

Wait, perhaps looking for a nonsense mutation. If I missed any, perhaps in a later part.

Wait, looking at mutant4's sequence: ...CGT … TGA. So the last part is ...CGT GGA TGA. The last codon is TGA, which is the stop. So no premature stop.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which mutation would disrupt the reading frame, but since all are substitution, not indels, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a change in the sixth codon. Let me count the codons.

Wait, perhaps Mutant4's sequence is as follows:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So codon 3 is TAC (Tyr), codon4 GCT (Ala), codon5 ACT (Thr), codon6 TCT (Ser), etc.

In the wild type, codon3 is CTC (Leu), codon4 GCT (Ala), codon5 GGT (Gly), codon6 ACT (Thr).

So, in mutant4, codon3 changed from Leu to Tyr, codon5 from Gly to Thr.

Gly is a small, very flexible amino acid, so changing to Thr (which is also small but has a hydroxyl group) might have a significant effect in the structure, especially if Gly is in a loop or a turn.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon. But earlier analysis suggests none of the options do that.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in looking at the sequences. Let me re-examine the given sequences.

Original gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, the first few bases of the wild type are ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1 is ATG TTT CT A CGC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So, in the wild type, the third codon is CTC (Leu), fourth GCT (Ala), fifth GGT (Gly), sixth ACT (Thr). In mutant1, the third codon is CT A (so third codon is CTA (Leu), four CGC (Arg), fifth GCT (Ala), sixth ACT (Thr). So, only the fourth codon changes from Ala to Arg.

So, in this case, it's a substitution that changes a small, nonpolar to a large, charged amino acid. That could disrupt the structure.

Mutant2's sequence: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT...

So wild type third codon CTC (Leu), mutant2 third codon CTA (Leu); same. Fourth codon wild GCT (Ala) → mutant2 AGC (Ser). So substitution from Ala (nonpolar) to Ser (polar). This could affect the structure, but perhaps less so than mutant1.

Mutant3's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC...

So, wild type third codon CTC (Leu) → mutant3 TAC (Tyr). Fourth codon GCT (Ala) same. Fifth codon GGT (Gly) → GTC (Val). So substitution from Gly (flexible) to Val (hydrophobic). So changes in two positions.

Mutant4's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Third codon CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr); fifth codon GGT (Gly) → ACT (Thr).

So, two changes. Both are amino acids that have different properties.

But without a stop codon, it's hard to know which would disrupt the gene the most.

Wait, but perhaps the question is looking for a mutation that introduces a stop codon. But I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the sequences. Let me check the exact sequences for each mutant.

The original gene sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1:

5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part:

Wild: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

So, the change is at the CGC in wild to CGC in mutant1? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the exact positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to look for which mutation is a nonsense mutation, creating a stop codon.

Wait, another look at the sequences:

Mutant4's sequence is: ...ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So, the codons after that are TGA. So, in mutant4, after GAA comes TGA as the next codon.

So, GAA is Glu, then TGA is stop. So in mutant4, the sequence is ...GAA TGA..., which would be two consecutive codons: Glu followed by stop.

Wait, but the wild type ends with TGA as the last codon. So in mutant4, does the mutation cause an earlier stop? Let me see.

Wild type sequence: ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

Breaking into triplets:

GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

So, the last codon is TGA (stop).

Mutant4's sequence: ...GTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

Wait, but in mutant4, the sequence is ...GCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA...

Breaking into triplets: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

So, codons are GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), ... TGA (stop).

So, the stop is at the end, same as wild type.

Wait, but the question is about the first exon area. So perhaps the mutations are in the beginning, but some of them could result in a frameshift or stop codon elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct approach is to look for a mutation that changes a critical part of the gene, perhaps the start codon or an early termination.

But looking at all mutations, none introduce a stop codon early. So perhaps the best way is to choose the mutation that disrupts the most critical part of the gene.

Another angle: the question says "eliminate the anti-nutritional compound". So a mutation that causes a nonfunctional enzyme would be desired. So, the best candidate is a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon.

Wait, but I don't see any in the options. So perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mutated sequence leads to a frameshift downstream, but the sequences are same length, so it's not a frameshift.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function. If the gene is nonfunctional, the enzyme isn't made.

Looking for a frameshift would be ideal, but all sequences are same length. So substitution.

The most effective substitution would be one that creates a stop codon. Since none do that, the next best is a substitution that disrupts a critical amino acid.

Mutant4 has two substitutions, but perhaps in a critical area.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the exons are spliced, but since the mutations are in the first exon, perhaps the introns are elsewhere, so the splicing isn't affected.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations affect the promoter, but the question says the changes are in the first exon, which is coding.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene via a nonsense mutation. But since none of the options do that, perhaps the correct answer is the one that has the most drastic amino acid changes.

Looking at the mutations:

Mutant1: one substitution (Ala→Arg)

Mutant2: one substitution (Ala→Ser)

Mutant3: two substitutions (Leu→Tyr, Gly→Val)

Mutant4: two substitutions (Leu→Tyr, Gly→Thr)

So, Mutant3 and 4 have two substitutions. Maybe that's more likely to disrupt function.

But which of these is more likely?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, because the substitution from Gly to Thr could disrupt a loop or structure where Gly's flexibility is important.

Alternatively, perhaps the best way is to look for a mutation that changes a critical part of the gene, like the start codon. But all start with ATG.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the anti-nutritional compound is a storage protein, and disrupting the gene would stop its synthesis. So the gene is expressed, but the mRNA is translated into a nonfunctional enzyme.

But without a stop codon, the enzyme would be full length but nonfunctional.

So the best bet is the mutation that changes the most critical amino acids.

In that case, perhaps Mutant4, which changes two codons, would be more likely to disrupt function.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

Which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound?

If the correct mutation is the one that introduces a stop codon, but none do, perhaps the best is to pick the mutation that changes a codon to a stop.

But all end with TGA.

Wait, perhaps looking again at the sequences for any TGA earlier.

Mutant4's sequence: ...GAA TGA...

In the wild type, the TGA is the last codon, so in mutant4, does the TGA appear earlier?

Let me count the number of codons.

Wild type sequence:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

So, the TGA is the last codon.

Mutant4's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

So, in mutant4, after GAA comes CAT. So, the codons are GAA (E), CAT (H), ATT (I), etc., then TGA (stop).

So, no, the TGA isn't earlier. So no premature stop.

Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of what each mutation does.

Mutant1: changes a codon from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg). So, in the protein, position 4 would be Arg instead of Ala.

Mutant2: changes GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So, position 4 becomes Ser.

Mutant3: changes CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and GGT (Gly) to GTC (Val). So positions 3 and 5 are changed.

Mutant4: changes CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), and GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). So positions 3 and 5 changed.

Now, the anti-nutritional compound is made by this enzyme. So, if the enzyme is nonfunctional, the compound isn't made.

So, the best way is to disrupt the enzyme's active site. But without knowing the structure, perhaps the most drastic change would be the best bet.

Mutant4 changes two codons, which could have a bigger effect. Alternatively, perhaps the change in position 3 (Leu→Tyr) is more critical.

In that case, maybe Mutant4 is the best option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3.

Wait, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon area. So perhaps the first exon is the beginning of the gene. So disrupting the start could be bad, but the start codon (ATG) is intact in all.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 introduces a stop codon through a different reading frame. But since it's a substitution, the reading frame remains the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon in a different frame. But no, because it's a substitution, not a frameshift.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a new stop codon in the same frame.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence again, perhaps I can look for any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons.

In Mutant4: ...GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So, any triplet in that sequence is a stop?

ACT is Thr, TCT is Ser, GTG is Val, GAT is Asp, GAA is Glu. No stop codons.

So I'm back to square one.

Given all that, perhaps the answer is Mutant4 because it has two substitutions, which would more likely disrupt the gene's function.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the anti-nutritional compound's synthesis is dependent on a specific domain of the enzyme, and the mutations that alter that domain would be more effective.

If the first exon includes the start of the coding region and perhaps a critical domain, then Mutant4, which changes two early codons, could have a bigger impact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 because it changes from Gly to Val, which is a bigger structural change.

But without knowing which amino acids are critical, it's hard to choose.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the change from Gly to Thr might disrupt a loop or a critical region where Gly's flexibility is important.

Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are A to D, with the four mutants. The correct answer is likely Mutant4 (option D), because it has two substitutions, which could have a more significant effect on the enzyme's function.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3 (option B), because it changes two codons.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the correct answer is the one that has the most number of changes in the critical regions. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, looking back, the wild type sequence is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant4 is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing:

Wild: positions 4-6: TTT → same in mutant4? No, because mutant4's sequence starts with TTTT.

Wait, perhaps the comparison is better done in the first few bases.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG ...

So, in wild type, after ATG TTT, comes CTC GCT GGT ACT...

In mutant4, after ATG TTT, comes TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the third codon in wild is CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr).

So, this substitution is from Leu to Tyr.

Leucine is a hydrophobic, aliphatic amino acid, while tyrosine is hydrophobic, aromatic. This substitution could significantly affect the structure if it's in a hydrophobic region.

Additionally, the fifth codon in wild is GGT (Gly), which in mutant4 is ACT (Thr). Gly is very flexible, while Thr is less so and has a hydroxyl group. This substitution could disrupt any structure that relied on Gly's flexibility.

So, two changes in important positions. Thus, Mutant4 is the most likely to disrupt the gene's function.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or by significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **Wild Type Sequence**:  
   The wild type sequence starts with `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`. The last codon is `TGA`, a stop codon.

2. **Mutation Analysis**:  
   Each mutant sequence was compared to the wild type to identify substitutions and their potential effects on the protein.

   - **Mutant 1**:  
     Substitution occurs at the fourth codon, changing `GCT` (Ala) to `CGC` (Arg). This changes a small, nonpolar amino acid to a large, positively charged one, which could disrupt the protein's structure.

   - **Mutant 2**:  
     Substitution occurs at the fourth codon, changing `GCT` (Ala) to `AGC` (Ser). This changes a nonpolar amino acid to a polar one, which could also affect the protein's function.

   - **Mutant 3**:  
     Two substitutions occur:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr): Changes a hydrophobic amino acid to an aromatic one.  
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `GTC` (Val): Changes a highly flexible amino acid to a hydrophobic one.  
     These changes could significantly disrupt the protein's structure.

   - **Mutant 4**:  
     Two substitutions occur:  
     - `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr): Changes a hydrophobic amino acid to an aromatic one.  
     - `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr): Changes a highly flexible amino acid to a polar one with a hydroxyl group.  
     These changes could disrupt critical regions of the protein, especially if Gly's flexibility was essential.

3. **Stop Codon Analysis**:  
   None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon before the natural stop codon `TGA` at the end of the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is the one that disrupts the gene's function the most. Mutant 4 has two substitutions that alter critical amino acids, potentially disrupting key structural or functional regions of the protein. While Mutant 3 also has two substitutions, Mutant 4's changes are more likely to have a significant impact due to the nature of the amino acid alterations.
