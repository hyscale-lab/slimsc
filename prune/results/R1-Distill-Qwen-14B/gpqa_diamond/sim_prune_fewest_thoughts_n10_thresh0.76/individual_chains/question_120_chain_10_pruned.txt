Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So I guess that means they're spread out evenly in all directions, no big clusters or anything. Now, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx, from 1 over plx to 1 over plx to the fourth.

Wait, parallax. Right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that parallax (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. That means as the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So more distant stars have smaller parallaxes. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars at a certain distance would depend on how many are in that distance range.

Wait, when you have a uniform distribution in space, it's not just about the number per distance, but how the volume works. I think the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dr. So N is proportional to 4πd² dr.

But the question is about number per unit parallax. So I need to relate this to parallax instead of distance. Since plx (p) = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So let me substitute that into the expression.

So N is proportional to d² dr. Substituting d as 1/p, so d² becomes (1/p)^2, which is 1/p². And dr is the change in distance, but since we're dealing with parallax, I need to express dr in terms of dp (the change in parallax). Let me think about that. How does dr relate to dp?

Since p = 1/d, then dr = (dp) * (-d²), because derivative of 1/d is -1/d². Wait, perhaps better to express dr in terms of dp. Let's take p = 1/d → d = 1/p → dr
