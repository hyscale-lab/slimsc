Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be carboxylic acids with some branching. 

Starting with the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since all the options end with COOH, which is a carboxylic acid, that makes sense. The COOH group has both O-H and C=O bonds. The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely the C=O stretch of the carboxylic acid. So that's consistent.

Now onto the 1H NMR. The question says there are several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds, so no vinyl (CH₂=CH-) groups. All options have structures without double bonds, so that's fine.

Looking at the specific NMR signals:

1. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets.
2. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm. That sounds a bit complicated. Let me break it down. The splitting patterns indicate the neighboring protons. When a proton is next to a CH group with two different neighboring groups, the splitting can get complex.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at each option and their possible NMR signals.

Let me list the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, let me write them more clearly:

Option A: The structure is (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, no, perhaps I should draw each structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each structure is a gem-dimethyl or gem-diethyl group attached to a central carbon, followed by a CH2 or another carbon before the COOH.

Wait, let's parse each option properly.

Option A: The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the central carbons are each attached to two substituents. Let me think: the molecule is (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the central part would be two carbons, each attached to two different groups.

Wait, maybe it's better to see each structure as:

Option A: The central chain is CH2-COOH, with two substituents on adjacent carbons.
