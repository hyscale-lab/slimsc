Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about three different reactions labeled A, B, and C. Each involves different reactants and conditions, and their products are given with options. I need to figure out which set of products is correct.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH as the catalyst. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. Wait, no, wait. In the presence of NaOEt, which is a base, I think dimethyl malonate would deprotonate to form the enolate. The enolate then attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

So, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the acrylate is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So, methyl acrylate would be CH₂=CHCOOCH3. Then 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. Oh, wait, no. Acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, so the structure would be CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 for methyl acrylate. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. So it's CH₂-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)
