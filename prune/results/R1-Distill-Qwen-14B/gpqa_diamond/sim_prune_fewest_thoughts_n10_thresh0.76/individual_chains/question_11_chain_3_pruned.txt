Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about SARS-CoV-2's molecular biology, and I need to find the incorrect statement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each option one by one.

The question asks which statement is incorrect. So I need to go through each option and see if I can spot the wrong fact.

Starting with option A: It says that nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN work as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The ExoN domain binds to nsp10, forming an active exonuclease complex that prevents dsRNA breakdown. Wait, I remember that SARS-CoV-2 has an exonuclease activity that's involved in replication. I think nsp14 has an ExoN domain, and nsp10 might be a cofactor. Oh right, the nsp14-ExoN along with nsp10 form a heterodimer. Their role is in removing mismatches, like in proofreading during replication. But wait, does this complex prevent dsRNA breakdown? Or does it actually cause it? Because exonucleases usually break down nucleic acids. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the ExoN is a 3'â†’5' exonuclease. So it would remove nucleotides from the 5' end of the RNA strand. But in the context of replication, the virus uses this to correct errors. So I think this statement is correct. Or maybe not? Because if this complex prevents dsRNA from breaking down, that might not be right. Or maybe it's the other way around. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I'll come back to this.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation, which is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Bcl-2 is involved in the intrinsic pathway, mitochondrial. The statement says ORF3a doesn't affect Bcl-2 levels, so apoptosis is via extrinsic. I remember that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a can induce apoptosis. Caspase-8 is indeed part of the extrinsic pathway. But does ORF3a affect Bcl-2? I think some studies suggest that it might interfere with mitochondrial function, but if this option says it doesn't affect Bcl-2, maybe that's
