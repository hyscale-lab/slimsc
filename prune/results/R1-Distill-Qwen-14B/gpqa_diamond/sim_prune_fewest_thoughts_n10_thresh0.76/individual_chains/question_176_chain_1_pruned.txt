Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). I'm assuming these are the components of a vector in a 3-dimensional space because the matrices for the operators are 3x3. So the state vector is ψ = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Oh, so the actual state vector is this vector divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. Because in quantum mechanics, state vectors must have a norm of 1. So the state is ψ = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

The problem involves two observables, P and Q. Their corresponding operators are given as matrices. The matrix for P is:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

And the matrix for Q is diagonal:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

We are to find the probability of measuring P=0 and Q=-1, in that order. So first, someone measures P, and if the result is 0, then they measure Q, and the probability of getting -1 in that case.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, it's the probability of getting P=0 first and then Q=-1. So the measurement of P first, and given that outcome, then the measurement of Q.

Wait, but the way the question is worded: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" So it's the joint probability of P's outcome being 0 and Q's outcome being -1, but considering that P is measured first, and Q
