Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. 

The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, which is the operator for the z-component of some momentum, I think. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector, and I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So, for P_z, I'll need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Does that mean it's not an eigenstate of P_z? Because in quantum mechanics, if two operators don't commute, their eigenstates are different. P_x and P_z probably don't commute, so the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z. That makes sense because the uncertainty would be zero only if the state was an eigenstate. Since it's not, I'll have to compute the expectation values.

Let me note down the given information. The operator P_x has a matrix form given. Similarly for P_y and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the matrices are written in the eigenbasis of P_z. That would make sense because usually, when you're working in a basis of eigenstates of an operator, the matrix is diagonal for that operator.

The state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me represent this as |ψ⟩. So, the components are [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ]^T.

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, the expectation value of P_z. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each basis vector |k⟩ corresponds to P_z |k⟩ = p_z^k |k⟩, where p_z^k are the eigenvalues.

Looking at the matrix for P_z:

It's a 3x3 matrix where the first row is (ℏ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0, 0, -ℏ). So the diagonal elements are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So the eigenvalues for P_z are ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

So the basis vectors are probably |+⟩, |0⟩, |-⟩ corresponding to these eigenvalues. Then, the state |ψ⟩ is expressed in terms of these basis states.

So, when I compute ⟨P_z⟩, it's the sum of the components multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait. The state is given as a vector in the eigenbasis of P_z, so each component is the amplitude in the corresponding eigenstate. So the first component is the amplitude for eigenvalue ℏ, the second for 0, and the third for -ℏ.

Therefore, ⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2) )^* * ℏ + (1/√2)^* * 0 + ( (-1/2) )^* * (-ℏ). Since all the components are real, the conjugate doesn't change anything.

So, let's compute each term:

First term: (-1/2) * ℏ = -ℏ/2
Second term: (1/√2) * 0 = 0
Third term: (-1/2) * (-ℏ) = ℏ/2

Adding them up: (-ℏ/2) + 0 + (ℏ/2) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So the matrix of P_z squared would have (ℏ)^2, 0, (-ℏ
