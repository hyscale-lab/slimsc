Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because quantum mechanics isn't my strongest subject. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The well has a length L, and we're supposed to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = pi² ħ² / (2mL²), so all the energies will be multiples of E.

Wait, right, identical particles. Oh, right, they must obey either the Pauli exclusion principle if they're fermions, which spin-1/2 particles are. So, each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a single particle in state n is E_n = (n² E), because E scales with n². So the energy levels go E, 4E, 9E, 16E, 25E, etc. Each level n can hold a certain number of particles, but because of the spin, each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, so for each energy level n, there are two possible spin states (spin up and spin down), meaning each n can hold 2 particles.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, so each can't have the same quantum state. So each particle must have a unique combination of n and spin. So for each n, two particles can occupy that state, one spin up and one spin down.

So now, we have four particles. Let's think about how they'll fill the energy levels.

The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. So, we need to fill the lowest possible energy levels with the four particles.

Starting with the lowest energy level, n=1. Since each level can hold two particles, n=1 can hold two. So two particles go into n=1 with spins up and down.

Then, the next level is n=2. That can hold two more particles. So with four particles, they all fit into n=1 and n=2. So the ground state configuration would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, each n can hold two particles, so for four particles, we'll have
