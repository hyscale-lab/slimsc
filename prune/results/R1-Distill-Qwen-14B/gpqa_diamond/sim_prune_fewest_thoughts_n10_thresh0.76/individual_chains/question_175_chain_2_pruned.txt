Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, and the symmetry axis is along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, which is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and also determine the possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a λ dependence.

Alright, I remember some basics about dipole radiation and antenna patterns. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is typically a function of θ. The power radiated in a particular direction is usually given by a function that depends on sin²θ or something like that.

Wait, but wait. The problem says it's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal. So it's not a simple dipole, but perhaps an oscillating dipole or something similar. But for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the z-axis, I think. The power radiated in a particular direction would depend on the angle θ.

The power pattern for a dipole is usually proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum would be when θ is 90 degrees, since sin(90) is 1, which is the maximum. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90, and zero at θ=0 and 180. So the maximum is at θ=90.

But in this question, the maximum power is A, so perhaps the function f is normalized such that the maximum value is A.

So, the function f(θ) would be something like f(θ) = A * sin²θ, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let's think again. For an oscillating dipole, the power radiated in a particular direction is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum is at θ=90°, which is 1, and the minimum at θ=0 and
