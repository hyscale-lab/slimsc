Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me see. I remember that in nuclear reactions, especially fission, the mass of the products isn't the same as the initial mass because some mass is converted into energy. Oh right, Einstein's equation E=mc² comes into play here.

The problem says that the initial atomic nucleus is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So that's the total energy before fission. Then it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. Wait, but the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh, so M is the initial mass. So M_initial = M, and the sum of the two fragments is 0.99 M. 

Let me break it down. Let the mass of the lighter fragment be m. Then the heavier one is 2m. So m + 2m = 0.99 M → 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the masses are m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M. 

Wait, but wait, does that mean the rest mass of each fragment is 0.33 and 0.66 times the initial M? Because the total is 0.99 M. So the initial rest mass was M, but after fission, the total rest mass is less. The mass difference must have gone into kinetic energy or other forms, like binding energy or radiation, but the problem mentions it splits into two fragments and nothing else. Hmm, maybe the kinetic energy is what accounts for the missing mass.

Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. So their kinetic energies can be found based on their rest masses and velocities.

But the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. And we need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so I have to calculate T1 both relativistically and non-relativistically, then find T1_rel - T1_classical.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about energy conservation. The initial energy is the
