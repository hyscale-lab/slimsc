Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that's a big clue. Ester groups usually have carbonyl (C=O) absorption around 1700 cm-1, I remember that from my notes. So, the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum details: six signals. Two are aromatic-Hs, two are vinyl-Hs (one doublet, the other a doublet of quartets), and two are for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. So I need to figure out what structure fits this.

Let me think about the aromatic substitution. Di-substituted benzene rings can be either ortho, meta, or para. But the substitution pattern for the NMR might help. The aromatic protons: if it's para-substituted, each substituent is opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. That makes sense for two signals. So maybe the substituents are in the para positions.

The ester group would be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no. Esters are usually RCOOR', right? So maybe the ring has an ester substituent. Alternatively, the substituent could be a group like an ethyl ester, or maybe a phenyl ester.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So, perhaps two substituents on the ring. Let me imagine the structure. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, maybe something like -O-CO-O-R or similar. No, wait, more likely, the substituent would be an alkoxy group attached to a carbonyl, making an ester.

Wait, the ester group itself is a substituent. So, for example, an ester substituent on the benzene ring would be something like -O-CO-R, where R could be an alkyl group or another aryl group.

But let's think about the NMR signals. The vinyl-Hs: a doublet and a quartet. Vinyl groups are typically from double bonds, like in an alkene. So maybe there's a substituent with a double bond, like a vinyl group attached to the ring. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent like a methylene group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, but the vinyl-Hs are showing two signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That makes me think of coupling between two sets of protons. Maybe a group like CH2=CH- attached somewhere. Or perhaps a conjugated system.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an allyl group or a vinyl ester. Let me think of a possible structure.

So, if the aromatic ring has two substituents: one being an ester group, and the other maybe a vinyl group, but wait, it's di-substituted, so two substituents in total. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a group with vinyl protons. Alternatively, the substituents could be such that their
