Okay, so I have this cycloaddition reaction problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione when heated. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. In a Diels-Alder, the diene (the conjugated diene) reacts with a dienophile (a molecule with a good electron-deficient double bond). The reaction forms a six-membered cyclohexene derivative, typically with stereochemistry determined by the endo rule.

Wait, but wait—thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. 2,5-dimethylthiophene would have methyl groups on the 2 and 5 positions. So the structure is like a thiophene ring with methyls opposite each other. Thiophene is aromatic, but when it's part of a Diels-Alder, it would act as the diene. Hmm, or is it the dienophile?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The diene is conjugated, four pi orbitals. The dienophile is usually something like a ketone, or another dienophile like a carbonyl. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups. Furan is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. So furan-2,5-dione has two ketones at positions 2 and 5. So the structure is a furan ring with O=C-O at positions 2 and 5? Wait, no, no. Wait, the numbering. Let me visualize it: furan is O in a five-membered ring. Positions 2 and 5 are adjacent to the oxygen. So furan-2,5-dione would have two ketone groups at those positions, making it a good dienophile because of the electron-withdrawing groups.

So, in the Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition, the diene is the conjugated four-pi-electron system. So 2,5-dimethylthiophene—wait, is thiophene a good diene? Thiophene is a five-membered
