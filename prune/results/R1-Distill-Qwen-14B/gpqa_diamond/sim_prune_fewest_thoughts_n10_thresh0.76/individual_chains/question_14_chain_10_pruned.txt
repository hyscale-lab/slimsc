Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and what happens when different fixation methods are used. Let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, I'll read the question again. So, the scenario is that someone did a ChIP-seq using PFA-fixed samples and an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After sequencing, they found some peaks, but when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. The question is asking where these disappearing peaks are likely to be located.

Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq is a method used to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. The process involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, fragmenting the DNA, immunoprecipitating with an antibody specific to the protein of interest, and then sequencing the DNA fragments that were bound.

PFA (paraformaldehyde) is a common crosslinker used for fixing cells, but sometimes other agents are used in combination. DSG (dithiothreitol) is a reducing agent. Oh wait, I think DSG is used after crosslinking to reduce disulfide bonds, which are strong crosslinks between proteins. So, PFA+DSG fixation might be a way to more thoroughly crosslink proteins to DNA.

Wait, but the peaks disappeared when using PFA+DSG. So the initial peaks were found with just PFA fixation, but not when they added DSG. That suggests that the initial method (without DSG) might not have been as efficient at crosslinking, or maybe it captured something that DSG disrupts.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial PFA alone didn't fix all the necessary interactions. Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. PFA is used to fix the proteins to DNA, right? DSG is used to break certain crosslinks between proteins, like those disulfide bonds, allowing the chromatin to be more open.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. DSG is actually used after crosslinking to digest the crosslinks. So, if you have a longer or more efficient crosslinking, maybe DSG is used to reverse some of the crosslinks, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps I have it wrong. Let me think. Oh, wait, no. I think in some protocols, after you fix with PFA, which crosslinks proteins to DNA, you might then sonicate the nuclei to
