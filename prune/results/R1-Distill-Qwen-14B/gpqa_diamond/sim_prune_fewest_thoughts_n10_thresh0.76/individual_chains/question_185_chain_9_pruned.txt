Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ·n, where σ is a vector of Pauli matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z, each being 2x2 matrices. So, σ·n would be the dot product of the vector of these matrices with the unit vector n.

Hmm, the dot product of vectors in matrix terms. So, if n is (n_x, n_y, n_z), then σ·n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Each σ matrix is a 2x2 matrix, so H is a 2x2 matrix.

Eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found using the characteristic equation, which is det(H - λI) = 0. Alternatively, since I remember that Pauli matrices have some properties, maybe I can find the eigenvalues more directly.

Wait, I think the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix are ±1. But that's when considering each σ_i individually. However, when you have a linear combination like σ·n, the eigenvalues might change. But wait, n is a unit vector, so the coefficients are such that the square of the sum would be a sum of squares. Let me think.

Another approach: the trace of H is the sum of the eigenvalues. The trace of σ·n would be the trace of each Pauli matrix multiplied by their coefficients. The trace of σ_x is zero, same for σ_y and σ_z. So the trace of H is 0, which means the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

What about the determinant? The determinant of σ·n. Wait, σ·n is a 2x2 matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (a d - b c) if the matrix is [[a, b], [c, d]]. But I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, another property: the square of σ·n.

Let me compute (σ·n)^2. Since σ·n is a Hermitian matrix (Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and n is real), (σ·n)² should be the identity matrix times some factor. Let me see:

(σ·n)² = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i squared is the identity matrix I (times something?), because σ_i² = I for each i. And the cross terms σ_i σ_j would be iε_ijk σ_k, but when you add all the terms, maybe the cross terms cancel out or add up in a certain way.

Wait, let's think again: each σ_i squared is I, so (n_x σ_x)^2 = n_x² I. Similarly for the other terms. The cross terms would be 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, etc. But since σ_x σ_y = iσ_z, and similarly for others. However, when you square the entire expression, perhaps the cross terms sum up to
