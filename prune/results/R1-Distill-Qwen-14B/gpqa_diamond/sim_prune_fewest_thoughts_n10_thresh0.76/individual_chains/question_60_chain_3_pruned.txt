Okay, so I have this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. So from the astronaut's perspective, the trip should take less time, right? But wait, the question is about how long it takes from the astronaut's point of view.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. The average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes too long, he might not live long enough. But let's think about the math.

The speed given is 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is really close to c. I think I can use the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t' is the proper time (the astronaut's time), and t is the time measured by someone on Earth. Or wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again.

Oh right, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is the shortest. So for someone on Earth, the spaceship is moving, so the time taken would be longer. But the question is asking from the astronaut's perspective. Wait, no, the question is about how long the astronaut will experience the trip. So the proper time t' is what's important here.

Wait, the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud. I'm not sure about the actual distance, but maybe the problem gives some hint. Wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987*c but doesn't specify the distance. Oh, I think I must have missed something. Oh wait, wait, the problem must assume that the distance is such that it's a certain number of light-years. Or perhaps perhaps it's a standard problem where the distance is considered as one light-year, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the time from Earth's frame. Let's say the distance is D. From Earth's perspective, the time taken is D/(0.99999987 c). But the astronaut's experienced time is shorter because of time dilation. So t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but I don't know D. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is more about the time experienced by the astronaut, given the speed. Oh, but without knowing the distance, how can I calculate the time? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says the astronaut is 22 years old. The average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes more than about 128 years (150 -22=128), then the astronaut might not survive. But the options are between 72 and 81 years. So maybe the trip takes about 77 years from the astronaut's perspective. But why?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's see. Maybe the distance is such that from Earth's frame, it takes a certain amount of time, but from the astronaut's frame, it's less due to Lorentz factor.

Wait, the speed is 0.99999987c. Let's compute the gamma factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v
