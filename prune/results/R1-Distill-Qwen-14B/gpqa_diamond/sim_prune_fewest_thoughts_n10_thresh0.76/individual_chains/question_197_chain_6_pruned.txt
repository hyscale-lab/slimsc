Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided include IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction is a reaction that reduces ketones to alkanes. It's a strong reducing agent. So, if Compound X has a ketone group, reacting it with red phosphorus and HI will remove the carbonyl, turning the ketone into a methylene group (CH2).

Wait, but wait... Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's under different conditions. Or maybe for the reduction of alkenes, but that's more with other reagents like H2 and catalysts. Hmm, no, Clemmensen is definitely for ketones to alkanes.

So, the first step is to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data to determine its structure.

Looking at the IR data: peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, so that's a ketone or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H peak, which might be part of the 3400–2500 region. But the peak at 1720 is more typical of a ketone or an aldehyde, maybe. Also, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So, aromatic rings are present.

The 1H NMR data: Let's break this down.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very downfield peak. Could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but sometimes up to 10.5. Alternatively
