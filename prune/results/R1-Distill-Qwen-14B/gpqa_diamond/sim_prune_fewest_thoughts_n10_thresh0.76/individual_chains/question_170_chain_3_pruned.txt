Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. An electron is in a spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation represents a two-component spinor, right? So the spin state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. And the question is asking for the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by the expectation value formula. For an operator O, the expectation value is ⟨O⟩ = χ† O χ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose. So I need to compute that.

First, I need to figure out what the S_y operator is. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ. So for the y-direction, S_y would be (ħ/2)σ_y.

Looking at the σ_y matrix, it's given as a 2x2 matrix:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So putting that into the S_y operator, it becomes (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, the expectation value is χ† S_y χ. Let me break this down.

First, let me write down the spinor χ. It's [3i, 4], but as a column vector. So χ = [3i; 4].

The conjugate transpose of χ, χ†, would be the row vector [ -3, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3 (since i squared is -1, so 3i becomes -3 after taking conjugate). Wait, no, wait. The original χ is [3i,4], so χ† would be [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i? No. Wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. The complex conjugate of i is -i. So 3i's conjugate is 3*(-i) = -3i. Wait no, 3i is 3 multiplied by i. So the conjugate is 3 multiplied by -i, which is -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

Now, let's compute χ† S_y. Since S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y, I can factor that out.

So χ† S_y = [ -3i, 4 ] * (ħ/2) * σ_y.

Wait, but when I'm computing χ† S_y χ, the multiplication order is important. So the full expression is χ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ.

So let me compute step by step.

First, compute χ† σ_y χ, then multiply by (ħ/2).

Alternatively, I can compute S_y acting on χ first, then take the inner product with χ†.

Hmm. Let me think. Let's compute S_y χ first.

S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. So σ_y * χ:

σ_y is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So when I multiply σ_y by χ = [3i;4], I get:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, that becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y χ = [ -4i; -3 ].

Then, multiply by (ħ/2): S_y χ = (ħ/2) [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, I need to compute χ† (S_y χ). Which is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So that's (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let me compute
