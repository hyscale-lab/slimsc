Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay and the Bubble Chamber at CERN. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, proper time is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, due to time dilation, the lifetime would be longer. So I need to calculate the Lorentz factor gamma, which relates the proper lifetime to the observed lifetime.

Gamma is given by gamma = E / m, where E is the total energy of the particle and m is its rest mass. Oh yeah, because E = gamma * m * c², so gamma is E/(m c²), but since energy is given in GeV and mass is also in GeV/c² (since E=mc²), the units should work out if we just take gamma = E/m.

So here, E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 7.9 is around 27. (3.41 * 8 is 27.28, so 7.95 maybe?) So approximately 7.91.

Wait, more accurately: 3.41 * 7.91 = let's see, 3.41 *7 is 23.87, 3.41 *0.91 is approximately 3.41*(0.9)=3.069, so total 23.87+3.069=26.939, which is close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.91.

So gamma is about 7.91. Then, the observed lifetime tau is gamma times tau_0. So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.91 *8 =63.28, so 63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, lifetime in the lab frame is longer. So the time the particle can travel before decaying is longer.

Now, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed. I think they're referring to the minimum distance resolution required in the Bubble Chamber to observe the decay. So the particle travels a certain distance before decaying, and the chamber needs a good enough resolution to spot that.

So the distance the particle travels is c multiplied by tau (the
