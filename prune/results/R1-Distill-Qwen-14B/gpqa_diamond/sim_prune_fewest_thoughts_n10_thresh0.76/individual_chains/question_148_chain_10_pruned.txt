Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again and break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds known. The substances A1 to A5 are involved in various reactions. My goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me list out the given information:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm. So A1 is probably a strong oxidizing agent. Wait, but fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent. Maybe A1 is some kind of fluoride?

Wait, no. Wait, A1 is a binary compound of fluorine and Y. So it's YF_something. And it decomposes into A2 and F2. So when A1 decomposes, it produces fluorine gas. That suggests that A1 might be a higher fluoride that, when heated, releases fluorine. For example, perhaps YF3 decomposes into YF2 and F2? Or maybe YF4? Wait, but fluorine is F2. So, if A1 is, say, YF3, maybe when it decomposes, it releases F2 and forms YF something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the decomposition reaction. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, then the reaction would be something like:

A1 → A2 + F2

So, if A1 is YF_x, then perhaps A2 is YF_y, and F2 is produced because part of the fluorine is released. But I'm not quite getting it yet.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized suggests that it's acting as a reducing agent. So A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. What fluorides are strong oxidizing agents? Hmm, maybe Y is a non-metal because fluorides of non-metals are often oxidizing. Alternatively, maybe Y is a metal, but that's less likely because many metal fluorides are reducing.

Wait, another point: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y
