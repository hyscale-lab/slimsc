Okay, so I'm trying to answer this Maxwell's equations question. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question is about a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So in our real world, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. I remember something about magnetic monopoles, which are hypothetical particles that act as isolated north or south magnetic poles. So in our universe, such monopoles aren't observed, but in this scenario, they exist.

The question is asking which of Maxwell's equations would be different in such a universe. The options are A to D, each pointing to different equations.

In our universe, Maxwell's equations are four in number. Let me recall them:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

So normally, in our universe, equation 2 says that the divergence of B is zero, which implies that there are no isolated magnetic monopoles. Because if there were, the divergence would be non-zero, like Gauss's law for E where there's a charge (ρ).

In this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles, so magnetic monopoles exist. That would mean equation 2 would change. Because for real monopoles, the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to Gauss's law for electric fields.

Wait, but what about the other equations? Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. Let's think: Faraday's Law deals with the curl of E and how it relates to the time derivative of B. If B has sources (monopoles), does that affect Faraday's Law?

Wait, no. Faraday's Law describes how changing magnetic fields produce electric fields. If B has sources, that doesn't directly change Faraday's Law. Because Faraday's Law is more about the curl of E, which is related to the time rate of change of B. So that equation would stay the same, I think.

What about Ampère's Law? Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the current and displacement current. In our universe, without monopoles, the divergence of B is zero. Does that affect Ampère's equation? Not directly. Ampère's Law is about the curl, not the divergence. So Ampère's equation would remain the same.

Wait, but wait a second. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that imply any changes to other equations beyond equation 2? I'm trying to remember. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, you also have to modify Ampère's Law, I think. Because without monopoles, Ampère's Law plus Maxwell's correction works. But with monopoles, maybe Maxwell's equations get more symmetrical.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Without monopoles, the equations are:

∇·B = 0
∇×E = -∂B/∂t
∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

If there are mon
