Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read through the question carefully.

The reaction pathway is a bit involved, so I'll break it down step by step.

First, benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene typically involves a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. The nitration usually occurs in a meta direction if there are activating groups, but wait, benzene is just benzene, so the nitration would add a nitro group in the meta position. Wait, no, wait. Nitration of benzene produces nitrobenzene, and the nitration is a meta director since nitro groups are deactivating. But wait, wait, benzene's first nitration will give nitrobenzene, where the nitro group is in the meta position relative to itself? No, wait, noâ€”it's a single nitro group. So when benzene is nitrated, the product is nitrobenzene, with the nitro group attached in a certain position. No, actually, benzene is symmetric, so regardless of where the nitro attaches, it's all the same structure. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, sometimes, the nitration can lead to more substitution if more than one nitro group is added, but in this case, the question says product
