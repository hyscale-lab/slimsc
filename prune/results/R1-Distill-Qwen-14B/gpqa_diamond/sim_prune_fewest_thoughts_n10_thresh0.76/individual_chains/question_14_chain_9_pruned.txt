Okay, so I've got this ChIP-seq question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see.

The question is about why certain ChIP peaks disappear when using PFA+DSG fixation instead of just PFA. So, I remember that PFA (paraformaldehyde) is a common fixative used in ChIP experiments. It cross-links proteins to DNA, right? Like, it preserves the interactions so you can pull down the protein-DNA complexes.

Wait, but what's DSG? Oh right, DSG stands for dimethyl sulfoxide with gluteraldehyde, or maybe I'm mixing that up. No, wait, I think DSG is a crosslinker too, maybe a stronger one. Or is it a way to fix different types of interactions?

So the setup is that they did ChIP-seq on human B cells with an antibody against IKAROS, a transcription factor. They used PFA-fixed samples, did the usual steps, and found some peaks. But when they used PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. Hmm.

So the question is where are these peaks likely to be found when they disappear. The options are repeats, introns, random locations, or active promoters and enhancers.

I think I should recall what PFA does. PFA is a mild fixative. It cross-links proteins to DNA, but maybe not as effectively as other methods. DSG, I think, is a more stringent crosslinker. Wait, no, perhaps DSG is used for more efficient crosslinking, like in some protocols where you have to fix for longer or in more challenging conditions.

Wait, another thought: wait, some protocols use PFA as the primary fixative, but sometimes they use other agents like formaldehyde. Oh wait, PFA is formaldehyde-based, right? So when they add DSG, maybe it's a different approach. Or perhaps DSG is used in some other context, like in Douncing or cell lysis steps. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I'm trying to remember: DSG is often used in the context of crosslinking in the presence of DTT? Or is it a crosslinker itself? Alternatively, maybe DSG is a reducing agent. No, wait, DSG is a strong reducing agent? Or is it an oxidizing agent? Wait, DSG is actually a reducing agent, used
