Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, wait. I should clarify: the effective temperature is the temperature of the star as seen from a distance. If parts of the star are cooler (the spots), then the overall emission would be less, right? But how does having spots change the effective temperature? Oh, I think the spots are darker, so they emit less light. So the star's total luminosity would decrease, which would make the effective temperature go down.

The question then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

Hmm. The ratio is n1/n2, I suppose. And they want to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, when there are no spots, the ratio is higher than when spots are present. The factor is (n1/n2)_
