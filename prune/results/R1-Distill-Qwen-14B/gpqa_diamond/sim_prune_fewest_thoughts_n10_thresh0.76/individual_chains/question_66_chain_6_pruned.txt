Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. But what about the symmetries they must obey?

First, I think about Lorentz symmetry. Oh right, because the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all the operators in SMEFT should respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense as an effective theory of the SM because it needs to preserve the same symmetries as the original.

Then Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, the SMEFT is formulated at low energies, and effective theories usually include all the symmetries of the original theory. Since the SM respects Poincare, so must SMEFT. But wait, do effective theories always respect it? Or is it that the underlying theory (like the UV completion) might break it? Hmm, I'm not so sure. Wait, no, because Poincare symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in relativity. So, all terms in the SMEFT Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP symmetry? The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric itself, because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the SM doesn't have CP, then its effective theory, SMEFT, wouldn't either. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

Then CPT symmetry. Hmm, I think the SM is CPT symmetric. Because CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. And the SM is CPT invariant. So any effective theory, like SMEFT, must also respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must obey CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait wait, wait. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz, right? So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So in the question, it says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So the question is about which symmetries are mandatory.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: Poincare symmetry is the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the operators in SMEFT respect Poincare, they must also respect Lorentz. But in this case, the question has options that include both 1 and 2. So if an operator respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz. So why are 1 and 2 both correct?

Wait, perhaps the operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry. Therefore, they automatically respect Lorentz. So option
