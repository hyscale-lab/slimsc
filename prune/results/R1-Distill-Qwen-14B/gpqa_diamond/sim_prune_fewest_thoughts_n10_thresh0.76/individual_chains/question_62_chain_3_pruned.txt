Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to synthesize this compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Whew, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring attached to a carbonyl group (the aldehyde), and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH(OH) group. So, it's like a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a CH2CHO (since aldehyde is CHO, but wait, no, the formula is [cyclohexanecarbaldehyde], which would be a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2CHO group, right? Or maybe it's directly attached. Hmm, maybe I should look at the structure again.

Alternatively, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part would be a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group, which is -CH2CHO attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, carbaldehyde is directly attached. So cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with a -CH2-CHO group? Or is it cyclohexane with a -CHO group attached directly? Wait, no: the formula for cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be cyclohexane with a -CH2CHO group, I think. Because 'carbaldehyde' would be a carbonyl group attached to a methyl group, but wait, maybe it's a substituent on the ring.

Wait, maybe it's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to another cyclohexane, which also has a formyl group. So the molecule has two cyclohexane rings. One is attached to a carbonyl (CHO) group (cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part) and the other is attached as a substituent via a CH(OH) group.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure mentally. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CH2CHO group. Then, attached to the
