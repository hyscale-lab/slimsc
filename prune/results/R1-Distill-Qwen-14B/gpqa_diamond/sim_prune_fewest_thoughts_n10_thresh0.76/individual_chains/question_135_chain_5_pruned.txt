Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f (y). I'm a bit rusty, but I think this is a Yukawa interaction term. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions. The general form looks like a Yukawa coupling where the boson X is mediating between two fermions.

So, the interaction term is something like λ X ψ ψ, right? That would mean that the boson X can decay into a pair of fermions. The possible decays depend on the fermion masses, because for a decay to happen, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of X.

X's mass is 6 GeV. So, I need to list all possible fermion pairs where each fermion has a mass less than 3 GeV, because each fermion would take away some energy, and for the decay to be possible, each must be less than half of X's mass.

Wait, let me think. The mass of X is 6 GeV. If X decays into two fermions, say f and f-bar, then each must have mass less than 3 GeV. Because 2m < M_X, so m < 3 GeV. So I need to list all fermions with mass less than 3 GeV.

What are the known fermion masses? Let me recall.

Electron: about 0.511 MeV, which is way less than 3 GeV. So electron pair is possible.

Muon: around 105.7 MeV. Also less, so muon pair is allowed.

Tau: 1.78 GeV. That's still less than 3 GeV. So tau pair is okay.

Then, the quarks. Up and down quarks are light. Up is about 2.2 MeV, down around 4.7 Me
