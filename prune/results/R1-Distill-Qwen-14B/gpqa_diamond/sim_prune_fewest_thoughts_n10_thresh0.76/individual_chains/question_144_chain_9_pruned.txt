Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and decay distances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't exist long enough to be observed directly; it's more like an excited state that decays quickly.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson X. The given data are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters. 

Wait, I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. Because if a particle lives longer, it can travel farther before decaying. So the decay distance should be related to the lifetime and the speed of the particle.

First, I need to find the lifetime of the meson. Oh, right, the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Wait, no, actually, Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, the full formula is Γ = ħ / τ. So tau is ħ divided by Γ. Let me make sure about the units. I know that ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. But wait, Γ is given in MeV. Oh, right, I need to convert that to GeV. So Γ is 0.320 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, divided by 0.320 GeV. Let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.320 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's the lifetime.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since the production energy is much higher than its rest mass (E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV), the particle is moving relativistically. The mean decay distance is probably given by L = βγ c τ.

Wait, β is the velocity over c, and γ is the Lorentz factor. So, I need to calculate β and γ for the meson.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c². So, solving for γ: γ = E / (m c²). But wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Now, γ is also 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So rearranging that, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let me compute that.

γ is approximately 6.6667. So 1/γ squared is (1/44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is about 0.9887. So β is approximately 0.9887, which is about 0.989 times the speed of light.

Now, putting it all together. The decay length L is βγ c τ. Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute βγ: β is 0.9887, γ is 6.6667. So 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.591.

c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = 6.591 * 3e8 m/s *
