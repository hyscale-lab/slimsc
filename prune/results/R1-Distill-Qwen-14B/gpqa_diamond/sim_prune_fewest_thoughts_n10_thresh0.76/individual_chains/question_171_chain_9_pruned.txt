Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positionsâ€”either ortho, meta, or para. The activating or deactivating nature of the substituent also affects the reactivity of the ring.

The question is asking me to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when they undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. The para-isomer's yield depends on the substituent's directing effects. Let me think about each substituent one by one.

Substance 1: C6H5-CH3. The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. It's an ortho/para director. So when bromine substitutes, the para position is a possible site. But I think the methyl group directs more towards ortho and para. But wait, in cases of steric hindrance, maybe para is more favored if possible. But I'm not sure how that affects the fraction. Anyway, methyl is activating, so the reaction is more likely to occur, but I'm focusing on the position here.

Substance 2: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. That's a phenyl acetate group. The substituent is an ester group (OAc). Esters are electron-withdrawing groups because the carbonyl is deactivating. They are meta directors. So when bromine adds, the para position isn't the main site. Wait, no, meta directors direct to meta positions, so the para position is not preferred. So the para-isomer would be less, maybe, but wait the substituent is in the para position relative to where the substitution occurs. Hmm, no, wait. The substituent itself is in the benzene ring; when the electrophile attacks, the substituent directs where the attack happens. So an ester group directs meta. So the para position would be less likely for substitution. So the para-isomer would be lower in yield for this one.

Substance 3: C6H5-Cl. The substituent is Cl, which is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to the electronegativity of Cl). Cl is a meta director. So substitution occurs mainly in the meta position relative to Cl. So, the para position isn't the major product. Wait, but wait: Cl is a deactivating group, which means it slows down the reaction, but it's ortho/para directing? No, wait, no. Wait no, I think I'm getting confused. Chlorine is a halogen; its substituent is actually ortho/para directing but deactivating. Because the lone pairs can donate electrons through resonance, but the inductive effect is stronger. So Cl is ortho/para. So when Cl is present, substitution occurs at ortho and para positions. So in this case, the para position is a possible site. But since the substituent is already Cl, which is a strong deactivating group, the ring is less reactive, so the reaction may be slower. But in the case of bromine in excess, perhaps the major product is the para isomer? Wait, but wait, when substituents are ortho/para directors, the para product is one of the possible major products, but sometimes the ortho is more favored due to steric reasons. But for Cl, I think the para isomer is a major product, but maybe not the only one.

Substance 4: C6H5-NO2. The substituent is nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the incoming bromine would substitute at the meta position relative to NO2. So the para position isn't a target. Thus, the para-isomer would have a low yield for this substance. Wait, but wait, the nitro group is meta directing. So substitution occurs meta to NO2. So the para position relative to where? Wait, no,
