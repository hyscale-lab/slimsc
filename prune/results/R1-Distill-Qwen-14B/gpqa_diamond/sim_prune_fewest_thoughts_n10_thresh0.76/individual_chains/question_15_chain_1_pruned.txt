Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both were detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. 

The host stars have the same radii. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they have same radii, so that's something to note.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers will choose the one with higher probability.

I think the probability of transit depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, but wait, actually, it's more about the orbital plane alignment. The probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on. But wait, actually, the probability is given by the ratio of the planet's orbital distance's impact parameter or something else... Or is it the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit?

Wait, I remember that the probability P that a planet transits its star is approximately P = (R*/a), where R* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that can't be right because R*/a would be a fraction. Oh wait, I think it's more precise to say that the probability is proportional to (R*/a), assuming that the orbit is randomly oriented. Because for a circular orbit, the probability depends on how likely the orbital plane is aligned edge-on, which relates to the ratio of the star's radius to the distance.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (R*/a) multiplied by (1 + (R_p)/(R*)) ), but when the planet is Earth-like, R_p is much smaller than R*, so maybe we can ignore that part. So the primary factor is (R*/a).

But wait, wait. The probability of a transit is actually given by the formula
