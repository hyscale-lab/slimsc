Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism involves the magnetic properties due to the motion of electrons, and the coupling term probably refers to the Hamiltonian term that involves the magnetic field.

So, the setup: the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. The problem mentions small values of m, which is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l, right? So small m would mean m is near zero. Not sure how that plays in yet.

The transition energy ΔE corresponds to a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series in hydrogen, right? The 486 nm line is the Balmer-alpha line, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2. So ΔE would be the energy difference between these two levels.

I need to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with ΔE. Paramagnetic coupling is usually due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, but in atoms, the magnetic moment can also come from orbital angular momentum, but in this case, since m is small, maybe it's the spin that's playing a bigger role.

Wait, but for orbitals, the magnetic moment is μ = (μ_B) * m / l, or something like that. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic moment μ_orbital is given by μ = (e/(2m_e)) * (L_z)/(c), which simplifies to μ_B * m / l, perhaps? Alternatively, μ = (μ_B) * (m / l), where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Hmm, I think μ_orbital = (μ_B) * (m / l), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's μ = (μ_B) * m, but I think the orbital contribution is μ = (e/(2m_e)) * (L_z)/(c), which is (μ_B) * (m_l / l), because L_z is ħ m_l, so substituting that gives (e/(2m_e c)) * (ħ m_l)/(l), but that might not be right. Maybe I should just think in terms of the magnitude.

Wait, but the paramagnetic term comes from the spin-orbit interaction? Or is it the Zeeman effect? No, the Zeeman effect is the splitting due to the magnetic field. Oh wait, the paramagnetic coupling term would be the energy due to the magnetic field interacting with the electron's magnetic moment.

So the energy is ⟨H⟩ = -μ·B. Let's calculate μ. For an electron, the magnetic moment is μ = -g_s μ_B S_z / ħ, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the spin magnetic moment is μ = -g_s μ_B (m_s), where m_s is the spin quantum number, which can be ±1/2.

Wait, but in the problem, it's the orbital magnetic quantum number m that's small. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is due to the orbital angular momentum, not spin. But wait, in atoms, the dominant contribution is usually from the spin, but maybe in this case, since m is small, the orbital contribution is smaller.

Wait, let's clarify. The orbital magnetic quantum number m can range from -l to +l in integer steps. If m is small, say close to zero, then the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is smaller because μ ∝ m.

So the paramagnetic coupling term would be something like H = -μ·B. Let's model this. For an electron, μ = -g_l * μ_B * m / l, where g_l is the orbital g-factor, approximately 1. So maybe μ ≈ μ_B * m / l.

Wait, but I might have gotten that wrong. Alternatively, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e c) * (m / l), because L_z = ħ m, so μ = (e/(2m_e c)) * (m ħ)/(l), which simplifies to (eħ)/(2m_e c) * m/(l). Since the Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e c), so μ = μ_B * (m / l). So the magnetic moment is proportional to m/(l).

The energy from the magnetic field would then be H = -μ · B. Since B is along Oz (z-axis), and L_z is along Oz, μ is along Oz too. So H = -μ B = -μ_B m B (if I'm considering the orbital part). Wait, no, because μ is μ_B * m/(l), perhaps.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up factors here. Let me double-check. The Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e c). So for orbital angular momentum L, the magnetic moment is μ = (L_z)/(ħ) * μ_B / (2l +1 )? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the expectation value of the magnetic dipole moment is μ = (μ_B) * (m_s) for spin, but for orbital angular momentum, it's μ = (μ_B) * (m) / (l), where m is the orbital quantum number and l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Wait, that might make sense. Because L_z is ħ m, so the magnetic moment would be (e/(2m_e c)) * (L_z)/(ħ). So that would be (e/(2m_e c)) * m. Which is μ_B * m.

Wait, that can't be right because if l is the angular momentum quantum number, then L_z = ħ m. So the magnetic moment μ should be (e/(2m_e c)) * (L_z)/(ħ). So substituting L_z = ħ m, then μ = (e/(2m_e c)) * m. So μ = μ_B m. Because μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e c), so (e/(2m_e c)) is μ_B / ħ. So (e/(2m_e c)) * m = (μ_B / ħ) * m. Wait, that would give μ = μ_B * (m / ħ) * ħ? No, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, maybe the orbital magnetic moment is μ = μ_B * m, and the spin is μ = g_s μ_B * m_s, where g_s is about 2. So for orbital, it's proportional to m, and for spin, it's proportional to m_s, which can be ±1/2.

But the question says m (orbital) is small, so m is near zero. So the paramagnetic term due to orbital would be small. Alternatively, if the paramagnetic term is due to spin, which is m_s = ±1/2, then that's a larger contribution.

Wait, but the paramagnetic coupling term is usually the interaction of the magnetic moment with the field. So if the magnetic moment is due to spin, then the energy would be H = -μ · B = -g μ_B m_s B. Since m_s is ±1/2, and g is about 2, so then H would be about ±2 μ_B (1/2) B = ± μ_B B.

But wait, the question is about the expectation value of H, which would be the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So ⟨H⟩ = μ_B B * something. Let me compute the actual numbers.

Let me compute the paramagnetic term. Let's model it as the Zeeman effect. For an electron, the energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B B m_s. But for spin, m_s is ±1/2. So the maximum shift is μ_B B (1/2). But in the problem, we're considering the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the same as the Zeeman term.

Wait, but the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom." So the transition energy is ΔE, and the paramagnetic term is another energy term. So we need to compare these two.

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states. The wavelength given is 0.4861 μm, which is about 486 nm. Let me calculate ΔE.

Wavelength λ = 0.4861e-6 meters. The energy is given by ΔE = hc / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 486.1e-9 m

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) 
= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (486.1e-9 m)
= 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 J
≈ 4.087e-19 J

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.087e-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. Let's compute that.

I think the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman energy. For an electron, the Zeeman shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m_s, where m_s is ±1/2.

But wait, the actual formula is ΔE = -g μ_B m_s B, where g is the Landé g-factor. For an electron, g ≈ 2.

So the magnitude of the shift would be about 2 * μ_B * (1/2) * B = μ_B * B.

So μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is about 9.274e-24 J/T.

So, with B=1 T, the paramagnetic term is:

⟨H⟩ = μ_B * B = 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but wait, that's the energy per electron. But in the hydrogen atom, how many electrons are there? Only one, so that's the energy shift.

So, now compare ⟨H⟩ = 9.274e-24 J with ΔE ≈ 4.087e-19 J.

Wait, 9.274e-24 is much smaller than 4.087e-19. How much smaller?

Well, 4e-19 / 9e-24 = approx 4e5, or 400,000 times. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE. So the paramagnetic term is negligible compared to the transition energy.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says to compare the magnitude. So if ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, which is the case here, then the correct answer would be option C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

But wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So with B=1 T, the paramagnetic term is 9.274e-24 J.

The transition energy is about 4e-19 J.

So 9.274e-24 is 4.637e-5 times smaller than 4e-19. Wait, no: 4e-19 is 4e-19 J, and 9.27e-24 is 9.27e-24 J. So 4e-19 / 9.27e-24 = approximately 43200 (since 4e-19 / 9.27e-24 = (4/9.27) * 1e5 ≈ 0.432 * 1e5 ≈ 43,200). So 43,200 times smaller.

So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE, so the paramagnetic term is negligible compared to the transition energy. So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the orbital contribution. But earlier I thought m is small, so the orbital term would be even smaller. Or perhaps the paramagnetic term in this case refers to the spin term, which is still much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait, the transition energy is in the order of 10^-19 J, and the paramagnetic term is 1e-24 J, which is six orders of magnitude smaller. So yes, definitely much less.

So the answer should be option C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute their magnitudes.

### Transition Energy ΔE
The transition energy ΔE corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \). Using the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.087 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of an electron with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For an electron, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin quantum number \( m_s \), which can be \( \pm 1/2 \). The energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by:

\[
\langle H \rangle = -g \mu_B m_s B,
\]

where \( g \) is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2 for an electron) and \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton:

\[
\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}.
\]

Substituting \( g = 2 \), \( m_s = 1/2 \), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), we find:

\[
\langle H \rangle = 2 \cdot (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 4.087 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( \langle H \rangle \) is approximately \( 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \). Comparing their magnitudes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{\langle H \rangle} = \frac{4.087 \times 10^{-19}}{9.274 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 43,200.
\]

This shows that \( \langle H \rangle \) is much smaller than \( \Delta E \). Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is negligible compared to the transition energy.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
