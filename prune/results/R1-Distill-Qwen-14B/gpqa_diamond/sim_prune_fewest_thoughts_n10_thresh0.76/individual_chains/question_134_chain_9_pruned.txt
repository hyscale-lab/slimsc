Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

Let me read the question again. It says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases, but this might not be standard concentrations here.

But wait, there are multiple acids and a base. So first, I think I need to find out how much each acid contributes and how much the base contributes, then see which is the limiting reactant.

Looking at the reactants: HCl is a monoprotic acid, H2SO4 is diprotic, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, probably contributing two hydroxide ions per formula unit.

So first, calculate moles of each.

For HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. HCl is a strong acid, so it donates one H+ per molecule.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But H2SO4 is diprotic, so each molecule can donate 2 H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, neutralization reactions: H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ available from the acids is HCl's 0.1 + H2SO4's 0.18 → 0.28 mol H+.

The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 mol.

So comparing H+ and OH-: H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent. No, wait, wait. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, I think it's fully dissociated, so all H+ is available.

Wait, wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so all OH- is available too.

So the reaction will proceed until the OH- is all used up. The H+ in excess will be 0.28 -
