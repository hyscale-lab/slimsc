Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) plus a neutrino. The given masses are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. So the options are A, B, C, D with different KE values.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have really tiny masses, almost negligible. So for this calculation, I think we can treat the neutrino's mass as zero. That should simplify things.

Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So after decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So p_mu = p_nu.

Now, let's think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, because it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi * c². But wait, the units are in MeV, so maybe c² is already factored in. So E_initial = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_final = E_mu + E_nu.

The muon's energy comes from its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu * c² + KE_mu. But again, units are in MeV, so m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², so m_mu * c² is 105.7 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = KE_nu.

So total energy after decay: 105.7 MeV + KE_mu + KE_nu. This should equal 139.6 MeV.

So 105.7 + KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6
Which simplifies to KE_mu + KE_nu = 33.9 MeV.

Hmm, but how do I find each KE? Oh, right, using conservation of momentum. Because the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon's momentum is opposite to the neutr
