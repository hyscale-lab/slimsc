Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which requires at least one chiral center. But wait, I remember there are other possibilities too, like if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not. Oh, and sometimes even if there's a chiral center, the molecule might not be chiral overall if there's a plane of symmetry or some other factor.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Wait, this is an alkene with substituents. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl and a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2CHCH2CH3. No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would have Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure is ClC=CH(CH3)CH2? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(H)=CH(CH3)-CH2-something? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So
