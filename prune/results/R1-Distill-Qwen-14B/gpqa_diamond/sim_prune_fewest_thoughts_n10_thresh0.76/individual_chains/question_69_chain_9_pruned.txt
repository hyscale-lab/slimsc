Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me think... The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. 

Alright, let me try to break this down. I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is measured in their rest frame, but when they're moving, we have to consider time dilation due to special relativity. So the proper lifetime τ₀ is given, which is 8e-16 seconds. But since the particle is moving at a high energy, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame will be longer because of gamma (γ) factor.

Wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Gamma equals total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Oh, right, the energy E is 27 GeV, and the rest mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = E / m = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is around 23.87 (3.41 *7=23.87), and 3.41*8=27.28, which is just a bit over 27. So gamma is approximately 7.915, maybe around 7.92 or so.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ * τ₀. Plugging in the numbers, τ ≈ 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.92 times 8 is 63.36, so τ is 63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 seconds. Wait, is that right? Because 7.92 *8 is 63.36, yeah, so 63.36e-16 s is 6.336e-15 s.

Now, the next thing is about the decay being observed. The problem says we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. I remember that the number of particles that decay is given by N = N₀ (1 - e^(-t/τ)), where t is the time the particle is moving, and N₀ is the initial number. But wait, actually, the question is about the minimum resolution, which I think refers to the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying, so that we can detect it. Or perhaps it's about the minimum distance that distinguishes the decay products.

Wait, maybe I should think about how much of the decay path needs to be detected. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The average lifetime is τ, so the average distance is c * τ, multiplied by beta (β), since the particle is moving at velocity v = βc.

Wait, right, the particle's speed is v = βc. So the distance it travels is L = β c τ. Because the lab frame sees the lifetime as τ, so the particle moves at speed v for τ time, so L = v * τ = β c τ.

So first, I need to find beta. Beta is v/c, and since gamma is known, how can I find beta? Oh, right, the relation is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So I can find beta using gamma.

Let me compute beta. Gamma is about 7.92. So 1 - β² = 1/(gamma²) → 1/(7.92^2) ≈ 1/62.7264 ≈ 0.01595. So β² ≈ 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405. Taking square root, beta is sqrt(0.98405) ≈ 0.992. So beta is approximately 0.99
