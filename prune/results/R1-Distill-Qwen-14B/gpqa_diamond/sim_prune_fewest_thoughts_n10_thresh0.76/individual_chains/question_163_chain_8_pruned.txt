Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so to dissolve it, we probably need an acid. Strong acid, like HCl or H2SO4, but since it's monobasic, it must donate one H+ per molecule. So maybe HCl.

First, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams, and I'll need its molar mass to find moles.

Fe has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85. 106.85 * 0.000936 is roughly 0.1. So that's correct.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, but when it reacts with a strong acid, it'll form Fe^3+ ions and water. The reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole provides one mole of H+. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, I need 3 moles of acid.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter (1000 cm³). So the volume (in dm³) needed is moles / concentration.

Wait, the acid is 0.1 M, so 0.1 mol per liter. So the volume V (in liters) is moles / 0.1.

So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but the options don't have 28.08 exactly. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. That's close. But why is that? Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe=55.85, O=16, H=1.

So 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17=55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol = 0.0009358 mol. So approximately 0.0009358 mol.

Then, H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009358 =
