Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

The compound is C9H11NO2. Let's write down the molecular formula. So, carbon 9, hydrogen 11, nitrogen 1, oxygen 2. Hmm, I remember that molecular formulas can sometimes give clues about functional groups. For example, the presence of O2 and N might suggest something like an ester, amide, or maybe a nitro group. But nitro groups are usually more in aromatic compounds, but the formula here doesn't fit a nitro group because the molecular formula doesn't have the right number of nitrogens and oxygens for that.

Looking at the IR data: there are two strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are typically N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Carbonyl could be from esters, amides, ketones, or maybe an acid. But in this molecular formula, the oxygen is two, so maybe it's an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR data: 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) â€“ that's probably a CH3 group attached to something that splits into a triplet. The triplet suggests two neighboring Hs, so maybe a CH2 group adjacent. Like in an ethyl group, where the CH3 is next to a CH2.

Then 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H). Broad singlet could be from an NH group, but in this case, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Or maybe an -NCH2- group, but if it's broad, perhaps it's NH. Wait, but the IR had N-H stretches. So maybe it's an amine or amide. Alternatively, oxygenated CH2 like in an ethyl group attached to something else.

Next, 4.5 ppm quartet (2H). Quartet means each H is next to a CH2 group with two Hs. So this quartet could be a CH2CH2 arrangement where the splitting is from adjacent CH2. For example, if it's an ester, like OCO-O-R. Wait, esters have the structure R-O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So in that case, the OCH2CH3 would have a triplet in NMR, but that's already accounted for at 1.20 ppm. Wait, the quartet at 4.5 might be a carbonyl adjacent group, like the CH2 next to a carbonyl. Or maybe it's the ester's CH2.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm doublet (2H) and 8.0 ppm doublet (2H). So two doublets each integrating to 2H. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring H. But in aromatic regions, doublets usually come from para substitution. Like if the substituents are on the benzene ring in
