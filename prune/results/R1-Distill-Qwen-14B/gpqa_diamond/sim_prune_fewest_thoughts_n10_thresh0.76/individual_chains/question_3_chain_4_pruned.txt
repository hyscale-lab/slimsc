Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a spin-half particle. Hmm, okay.

The particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Both |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. Oh right, σz is the Pauli z-matrix, I think. So the state is a linear combination of σz's eigenstates.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. The formula is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So to find the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. Let's break this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ is +1 and for |↓⟩ is -1. The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So when we compute ⟨σz⟩, it's the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of |↓⟩ times -1.

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The probabilities are the square of the absolute values. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is a bit trickier. Its eigenstates are |+⟩ and |-⟩, I think, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, since σx is the Pauli x matrix, perhaps I can compute the expectation value by expanding the state and using matrix multiplication.

The state ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the basis |↑⟩, |↓⟩. The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is ψ† σx ψ. Let's compute that.

Wait, ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩, so in vector form it's [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. The conjugate transpose (bra) would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] (since the coefficients are real here, so no complex conjugate needed). So ψ† is [0
