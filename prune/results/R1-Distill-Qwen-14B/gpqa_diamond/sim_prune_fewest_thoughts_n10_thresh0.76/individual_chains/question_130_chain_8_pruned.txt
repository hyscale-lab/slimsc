Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space that absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission is a specific wavelength in hydrogen. Oh wait, the Lyman alpha transition is when an electron moves from the second energy level to the first, emitting a photon at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. Right, so that's in the ultraviolet range.

But the problem here is absorption, not emission. So these clouds are absorbing the light from quasars at that wavelength. So when the quasar's light passes through the hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen atoms in the cloud absorb the light at 1216 Angstroms, creating a absorption line.

Now, the question is about redshift. Redshift affects the wavelength we observe. The formula for redshift (z) is: observed wavelength (λ_obs) = emitted wavelength (λ_emit) * (1 + z).

Wait, but we need to see if the absorption line is in the optical range because ground-based telescopes can't observe in the ultraviolet due to the atmosphere blocking those wavelengths. So the Lyman alpha absorption at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) is in the far UV. So for ground-based telescopes, which observe in the optical range (visible light), this absorption line must be redshifted into the optical.

What's the visible spectrum range? Approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So the observed wavelength after redshift must be within 400-700 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is way below 400 nm. So to be observed in the optical, it has to shift into that range.

Let me do the math. Let’s find the minimum redshift z such that λ_obs >= 400 nm (4000 Angstroms). Because if the observed wavelength is at least 400 nm, it's in the visible range.

So using the formula:

λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z)

We need λ_obs >= 4000 Angstroms (since 400 nm = 4000 Angstroms). λ_emit is 1216 Angstroms.

So,

4000 <= 1216 * (1 + z)

Divide both sides by 1216:

4000 / 1216 <= 1 + z

Calculate 4000 / 1216. Let me compute that. 1216 goes into 4000 about 3.29 times because 1216 * 3 is 3648, and 1216*3.29 is roughly 4000. Let me compute it more accurately.

4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.292.

So,

3.292 <= 1 + z

Subtract 1,

z >= 2.292.

So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, and option D is 1.9. So 2.29 would be just a bit below 2.4, but wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So z must be at least 2.29 for the absorption line to be in the optical.

But wait, wait. Is the lower limit the minimum value that the redshift can take for detection? So if z is higher than this, the absorption line is further into the optical. But for detection, the lowest z would be when the absorption line is just within the optical. So the minimum z is when λ_obs is 400 nm.

So 400 = 121.6*(1+z)

Wait, wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 * 0.1 = 121.6 nm.

So,

121.6*(1+z) = 400 nm.

So,

1 + z = 400 / 121.6 ≈ 3.292.

So,

z ≈ 2.292.

So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is z >= 2.29. So the options are either 2.4 or 1.9. 2.29 is between 1.9 and 2.4. So the lower limit would be higher than 2.29, so the minimum z is 2.29, so any z above that would work. So the question asks for the lower limit, which is the minimal z that the object can have and still be detected. So the minimal z is when the absorption line is just observable—so when λ_obs is 400 nm. So the minimal z is 2.292. So the lower limit is around 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29, and option D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the lower limit is when z is approximately 2.29, so any object with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. The options given are C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. So the correct answer must be the one closest to 2.3.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift of the object. So the object's redshift must be such that the absorption line is in the visible range. So the minimal redshift where the absorption line
