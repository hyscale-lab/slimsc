Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question has two separate reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each, choosing from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing different possibilities for A and B.

Alright, let's tackle the first reaction:

Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + THF, KH, H+ → Product A

I remember that THF is tetrahydrofuran, which is a common solvent. KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But wait, the reaction conditions are THF with KH and then H+—so maybe it's a deprotonation followed by some kind of acid workup.

The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The spiro here is [3.5], so that's a five-membered and a seven-membered ring? Wait, no. Wait, the spiro notation is [number of carbons in each ring]. So [3.5] would mean a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring? Hmm, but wait, the molecule is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached at position 1 of the spiro alcohol.

Wait, the structure: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro system is a 3-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and a 5-membered ring (like cyclopentane?), but connected at one carbon. Wait, no. The spiro is [3.5], so the two rings are each connected at the same carbon. So the non refers to the total number of carbons in the spiro system, perhaps? Wait, no. The spiro compound has two rings connected at a single atom. So 1-vinyl would be attached to that spiro carbon.

Wait, the structure: the spiro would have a three-membered ring and
