Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I need to think carefully about how to approach this. Let me start by recalling what I know about quantum mechanics, especially regarding spin states and expectation values.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I think this is a two-component spinor, so it can be represented as a column vector. So, the spin state χ would be:

χ = [3i, 4]^T.

Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an observable is given by the expectation value formula. For an operator, say S_y, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated as χ† σ_y χ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-component of spin.

Oh wait, Pauli matrices, right. The σ_y matrix given in the note is:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So, the steps I need to follow are:

1. Compute χ†, the conjugate transpose of χ. Since χ is [3i, 4], the conjugate would make the first component -3i, and the transpose makes it a row vector. So χ† is [-3i, 4].

2. Multiply χ† with σ_y. So, matrix multiplication: χ† σ_y.

3. Then multiply the result by χ. 

But wait, let me clarify the order. The expectation value is ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ. That's correct because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, but since σ_y is given, maybe we don't need the factor because the options have hbar in them. Oh, wait, in the options, the answer includes hbar, so perhaps the expectation value is in terms of σ_y, and then multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, the spin operator S_y is given by (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ would be (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y. So the calculation would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the trace we're about to compute.

Wait, but the problem is just asking for the expectation value of S_y, which is (ħ/2) times ⟨σ_y⟩. So I need to compute the expectation value of σ_y first, then multiply by ħ/2.

So let me proceed step by step.

First, χ† σ_y. Let me write that out.

χ† is [-3i, 4].

σ_y is [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

Multiplying χ† with σ_y would be a 1x2 matrix multiplied by a 2x2 matrix, resulting in a 1x2 matrix.

Wait, matrix multiplication: the first element would be (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

The second element would be (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) → (3i²) because (-3i)(-i) is 3i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3. And the second term is
