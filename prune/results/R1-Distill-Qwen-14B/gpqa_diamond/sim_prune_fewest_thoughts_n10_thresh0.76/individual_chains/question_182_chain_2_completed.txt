Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of a semiconductor device, particularly in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is given as J equals (9/8) epsilon mu V squared over L cubed. 

Wait, I think SCLC means that the current is limited by the space charge, so the electric field is created by the charge accumulated in the device itself. That would be in the case where the voltage isn't high enough to cause breakdown or where other effects like thermal emission aren't dominant.

The question is about the validity of the equation. So, what conditions must be met for the Mott-Gurney equation to hold true?

Looking at the options. Each option talks about whether it's a trap-free device, single or two carriers, type of contact (Ohmic vs Schottky), and which currents are negligible.

I recall that the Mott-Gurney derivation assumes a single-carrier mechanism. So, in a two-carrier device, the equation might not apply because of the interactions between electrons and holes. So options D, which mentions a two-carrier device, might not be correct.

Ohmic contacts imply that the carrier injection is efficient, with no significant barrier. In contrast, Schottky contacts have a barrier, which would affect the current transport. But wait, the Mott-Gurney equation doesn't depend on the type of contact because it's based on the space charge effect. Or does it? Hmm, maybe not. The equation is more about the space charge region, so perhaps the contact type (Ohmic vs Schottky) doesn't affect the form of the equation. But wait, the initial conditions for space charge might depend on whether there's a barrier. Oh wait, no, the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the current is due to the space-charge effect, so regardless of the contact, as long as it's in that regime. So perhaps the type of contact isn't the main issue here.

Wait, but the presence of traps (defects) can affect the current. If the device has traps, then the current might not follow the Mott-Gurney equation because traps can cause carrier scattering or recombination, which isn't accounted for in the simple model. So the equation is valid for trap-free devices. So, any option that says "trap-free" would be correct.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current.

Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is in the SCLC regime, which is when the current is limited by space charge and drift is the main transport mechanism. So if drift current is negligible, does that make sense? Wait, SCLC implies that the current is due to drift, because the space charge creates an electric field leading to drift. If drift current is negligible, maybe it's not SCLC anymore.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the current is in the SCLC (or sometimes called the Child's law) regime. The derivation assumes that the injection is such that the space charge dominates, leading to a particular dependence on voltage. So, in this regime, drift current is the main component because that's how the carriers move under the electric field.

Wait, but the question in the options says "negligible drift current" in option A. That seems contradictory. If drift is negligible, then the current isn't due to drift, so it wouldn't fit the SCLC scenario. So option A might be incorrect.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current.

Wait, no carrier injection barrier would mean an Ohmic contact, I think. So, the device has no barrier, which implies it's easily injected. But the equation's validity doesn't depend on the contact type; it's about space-charge limitation.

But the key points are: single-carrier, trap-free. Now, the equation also assumes that diffusion current is negligible. Because in the SCLC, the current is mainly due to drift, not diffusion. So if diffusion is considered, the equation might not hold. So the condition that diffusion current is negligible is correct.

Option C: Single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion.

Schottky contact means there's a barrier. So, in such a case, the contact might affect how the current is established. But the Mott-Gurney equation, as I understand, applies regardless of the contact type because it's about the space charge. So, whether it's Ohmic or Schottky, if the current is space-charge limited, the equation should hold. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. The presence of a barrier might influence the initial conditions but not the general form of the equation.

Wait, but the equation itself doesn't consider the contact. It's more about the accumulation of space charge. So, the equation is valid for any contact type as long as the current is space-charge limited. So, option C's validity depends on whether the equation holds with a Schottky contact. I'm not certain, but I think the contact type isn't a factor as long as you're in the SCLC regime.

Option B says no carrier injection barrier, which would mean Ohmic contact. So, perhaps that's correct because the assumption is that you have a single carrier, no traps, and negligible diffusion (so drift dominates). So, B might be correct.

Wait, but what about the other parts of the options. For example, option A says "Ohmic contact and negligible drift current." But if drift is negligible, then it's not the SCLC case, right? Because SCLC relies on drift. So A can't be correct because it says drift is negligible.

Option B says no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic) and negligible diffusion. That seems correct because the equation assumes that the current is due to drift, so diffusion (which is another way carriers move) is not significant.

So, putting it all together, the correct conditions are:

- Single-carrier device (so options D is out)
- Trap-free (so options without trap-free are out)
- No injection barrier (so Ohmic contact, which is option B)
- Diffusion current is negligible (so drift dominates)

So, option B: "The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current."

Wait, but what about the drift current? The Mott-Gurney equation is in the situation where drift is the main current. So, if the equation is valid when drift current is significant, then having 'negligible' drift would be wrong. Oh wait, no. The equation itself describes the current due to drift under space-charge conditions. So, the statement in the option must not have conditions that contradict the equation's assumptions.

Wait, the option says 'negligible diffusion current.' That's okay because in SCLC, diffusion is less significant than drift. So, the equation holds when diffusion is negligible. So the statement in B would be correct.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. It assumes that the current is dominated by drift under the electric field created by the accumulated space charge. The equation is valid for single-carrier devices, as it does not account for the interactions between electrons and holes in two-carrier systems. Additionally, the presence of traps (defects) can disrupt the space-charge dynamics, so the equation is applicable to trap-free devices.

The equation also assumes negligible diffusion current, as the current in the SCLC regime is primarily due to drift. The type of contact (Ohmic or Schottky) does not fundamentally affect the validity of the equation, as long as the current is space-charge limited. However, an Ohmic contact ensures efficient carrier injection without significant barriers, which aligns with the assumptions of the equation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Mentions negligible drift current, which contradicts the SCLC regime where drift is the dominant mechanism. This makes Option A incorrect.
- **Option B**: Specifies a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. These conditions align with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, making this option correct.
- **Option C**: Mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a carrier injection barrier. While the equation can still apply in the SCLC regime, the presence of a barrier is not ideal for the assumptions of the equation. This makes Option C less favorable.
- **Option D**: Refers to a two-carrier device, which is inconsistent with the single-carrier assumption of the Mott-Gurney equation. This makes Option D incorrect.

Thus, the correct statement is Option B, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.

Answer: B
