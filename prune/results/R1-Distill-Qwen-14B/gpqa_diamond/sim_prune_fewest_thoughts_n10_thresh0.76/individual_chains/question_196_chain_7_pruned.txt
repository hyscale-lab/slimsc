Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I guess I need to take into account special relativity effects.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass, v_max. I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, potential energy is (1/2)kA², so kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. So that's option C, but I don't think that's the right answer here because the question is relativistic.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to consider how the energy is stored in the oscillator.

The total energy of the oscillator in the relativistic case should still be the sum of kinetic and potential energy. At maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At maximum velocity (which would be when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium point), all energy is kinetic.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the harmonic oscillator, whether classical or relativ
