Alright, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, okay, so the question is about an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two A+ and two A- particles. The given mass-energy of A is 300 MeV, and the antiproton is moving slowly. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, so the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, does that mean its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass energy? Or perhaps that it's non-relativistic? Hmm, but protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the initial system is a proton at rest and an antiproton moving slowly.

Wait, maybe I should think about conservation of energy and momentum here. In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. Oh wait, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we're in the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with some velocity.

Wait, but the problem states the antiproton is "slowly moving", which might imply that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. So perhaps the initial velocity is non-relativistic. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is telling us to ignore the kinetic energy of the antiproton, treating it as if it's at rest. Wait, but the antiproton is a particle, and in the problem, it's moving, so perhaps we shouldn't neglect its momentum. Hmm.

Wait, but the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Let me think about the conservation laws. The total energy and momentum must be conserved.

First, the initial momentum. Since the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, the initial momentum is all from the antiproton. Let me denote the momentum of the antiproton as p_pbar. After the collision, the products are four particles: two A+ and two A-. So the total momentum after collision must be equal to the initial momentum.

But wait, the initial system is p and p̄. The proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton's momentum is gamma*m_p*v, where v is its velocity. Since it's moving slowly, maybe v is small compared to c. Hmm, but the product particles are moving, so perhaps the initial momentum is equal to the sum of the momenta of the four As.

Wait, but four particles... that complicates things. If all four particles are moving in the same direction, their momenta could add up. Alternatively, perhaps they're moving symmetrically, but in this case, since the initial is only the antiproton moving, the products would have some symmetric movement.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is symmetric. Let me think: the products are two A+ and two A-. Since the initial charge is (p is +e, p̄ is -e), the total charge is zero. So the products must have a net charge of zero. Two A+ and two A- would sum to zero, so that works.

But how does that help me with the velocity?

Let me approach this step by step.

First, write down the conservation equations.

Initial momentum: p_initial = momentum of p̄ (since p is at rest). So p_initial = gamma_pbar * m_p * v_pbar. Since m_p (proton mass) is same as m_pbar (antiproton), let's denote m = m_p.

After the collision, the total momentum is the sum of momenta of each A. So p_total = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4, where each p_i is the momentum of each A particle.

But this might be complicated because each A could have different directions. However, perhaps in this scenario, all four particles are moving in the same direction, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the As are moving in pairs symmetrically, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all four As are moving in the same direction as the antiproton. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the As are emitted symmetrically. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, but in the lab frame, the initial system has the proton at rest and the antiproton moving. So the center-of-momentum frame is moving with some velocity relative to the lab frame.

Alternatively, perhaps in the rest frame of the combined system, the total momentum is zero. But maybe I'm making this more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more about energy conservation than momentum. Let's think about energy.

In the lab frame, the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving, so its energy is gamma m_p c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor for its velocity.

The initial total energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The products are four A particles. Each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for each A's velocity.

Wait, but I don't know the velocity of each A, so that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a collision where all the kinetic energy is converted into the rest mass of the products, but that's probably not the case because the products are moving.

Wait, another approach: using conservation of 4-momentum.

The total 4-momentum before annihilation is the sum of the proton's 4-momentum and the antiproton's.

The proton is at rest, so its 4-momentum is (E_p, 0) where E_p = m_p c².

The antiproton's 4-momentum is (gamma m_p c², gamma m_p v_pbar c). Let's denote v_pbar as the velocity of the antiproton.

So the total energy before is E_p + gamma m_p c².

The total momentum before is gamma m_p v_pbar.

After the annihilation, the four A particles will have their own 4-momenta. Let's denote each A's 4-momentum as (E_Ai, p_Ai). The sum of all four must equal the initial 4-momentum.

But that's four particles, which complicates things. Maybe we can assume that the products are moving in such a way that all their momenta add up vectorially to the initial momentum. But without knowing their directions, this is tricky.

Wait, maybe the problem is symmetric. If the products are two A+ and two A-, perhaps each pair moves in opposite directions. For example, two As move in one direction, and the other two in the opposite direction. Or maybe all four move in the same direction.

Alternatively, perhaps all four particles move in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum, which is the antiproton's.

Wait, but without knowing the directions, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that each A+ and A- have opposite momenta, so that in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. Wait, but that's the case only if the products' momenta cancel each other. But in the lab frame, the initial momentum is non-zero, so their momenta must sum to that initial momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should simplify. Let's assume all four As move in the same direction as the initial antiproton. So, each A has momentum p_A, and the total momentum after collision is 4 p_A. Wait, but no, that's only if each has the same momentum, which isn't necessarily the case. Hmm, perhaps that's an assumption I can make.

Wait, but maybe it's better to use the concept of invariant mass. The invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2.

The invariant mass before collision would be the same as the invariant mass after.

Wait, the initial system is a proton at rest and an antiproton moving. The invariant mass squared is (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2.

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p v_pbar.

So the invariant mass squared is [m_p c² (1 + gamma)]^2 - [gamma m_p v_pbar c]^2.

Hmm, but the invariant mass after the collision would be the sum of the energies of the As squared minus (sum of their momenta times c) squared.

Wait, but that might not be easier to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the rest frame of the combined system.

Wait, the combined system is the proton and antiproton. The total energy is E_p + E_pbar, and the total momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

The invariant mass of the system is the same in all frames, so:

M^2 c^4 = (E_p + E_pbar)^2 - (p_pbar c)^2.

But since the products are two A+ and two A-, which might form two pairs, perhaps their total invariant mass should add up? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the products are two A+ and two A-, perhaps their masses are m_A each. So the total rest mass after the collision is 4 m_A c².

But energy isn't just rest mass; the kinetic energy of the products contributes as well.

Wait, but the problem says that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the initial kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass. So maybe the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c² (since proton and antiproton have rest mass m_p c² each). Wait, but the initial energy would be E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c². If the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But the products are four particles each of mass m_A. So the total rest mass after is 4 m_A c².

But wait, m_A is given as 300 MeV. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV. So 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. But the initial rest mass is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial rest mass is higher than the products' rest mass. So there's some energy left for kinetic energy of the products.

But this doesn't directly help me find the velocity.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v_pbar.

After the collision, we have four A particles. Let's assume that all four are moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton. So each has momentum p_A in the same direction.

So, the total momentum after is 4 p_A.

But that's an assumption; in reality, they might move in different directions, but perhaps for simplicity, this is a valid assumption.

Wait, but perhaps the particles are moving symmetrically. For example, two moving in one direction and two in the opposite. Then their momenta would add up to 2 p_A - 2 p_A = 0 if they have the same magnitude but opposite directions. But that can't be, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe it's better to consider that the total momentum after the collision is the same as the initial.

So, sum of all p_Ai vectors equals p_initial.

But without knowing their directions, this is hard.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the As are all moving with the same velocity. Then, each A has momentum gamma_A m_A v_A, and the total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

But then, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v_pbar.

But again, I have multiple variables.

Wait, but maybe I can make some approximations. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can treat it as non-relativistic. So gamma ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c²), but perhaps even approximate gamma as 1. So the initial momentum is approximately m_p v_pbar.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the antiproton's velocity is much less than c, so v_pbar << c, making it non-relativistic. Then, its momentum is m_p v_pbar, and energy is (1/2) m_p v_pbar² + m_p c².

But that's getting into non-relativistic kinematics, which might not be the right approach.

Wait, let's think about the threshold condition. The minimum energy required to produce the particles. But I don't think that's what's being asked here. The question is about the velocity of the A particles, so perhaps it's more about the energy and momentum transfer.

Alternatively, perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, the products have zero momentum, but since the initial system has some momentum, the products must carry that away.

Wait, perhaps another approach: in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So the products must move in such a way that their momenta cancel out. But in that frame, each A would have some velocity, but the same speed in opposite directions perhaps.

Hmm, but I'm getting stuck. Let's try to write down the equations.

In the lab frame:

Energy conservation: E_p + E_pbar = 4 E_A.

Momentum conservation: p_pbar = 4 p_A.

Assuming all four As move with same speed and same direction. But this might not be correct, but let's proceed.

Each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

Momentum of each A: p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So from momentum: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v_pbar.

From energy: (E_p + gamma m_p c²) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

E_p is m_p c².

So equation 1: m_p c² (1 + gamma) = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Equation 2: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v_pbar.

Hmm, but we have three variables: gamma_A, v_A, gamma. But perhaps we can express gamma in terms of v_pbar.

Wait, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_pbar²/c²)).

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_pbar is << c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v_pbar²)/(2 c²). But maybe for small velocities, it's approximately 1. Wait, but I don't know v_pbar.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by assuming that the velocity of the As is non-relativistic as well. But I don't think that's a given.

Alternatively, perhaps the As are moving at the same speed as the antiproton. Hmm, but that might not hold.

Wait, maybe the initial antiproton's velocity is so slow that its gamma is close to 1. So gamma ≈ 1. Then, equation 1 becomes:

m_p (1 + 1) c² =4 gamma_A m_A c².

So 2 m_p c² =4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²: 2 m_p =4 gamma_A m_A.

Gamma_A = (2 m_p)/(4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A).

Plugging in the numbers: m_p is about 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So gamma_A = 938 / (2 * 300) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A ≈ 1.563.

Then, gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A²) = 1.563.

So sqrt(1 - beta_A²) = 1/1.563 ≈ 0.64.

Square both sides: 1 - beta_A² ≈ 0.41.

So beta_A² ≈ 1 - 0.41 = 0.59.

Beta_A ≈ sqrt(0.59) ≈ 0.768.

So v_A ≈ 0.768 c.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

But wait, this is an approximation because I assumed that gamma was approximately 1. But in reality, the initial antiproton may not have v_pbar << c, but perhaps the problem says it's moving slowly, so perhaps this approximation is valid.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem statement says the antiproton is slowly moving, so v_pbar is low, so gamma is close to 1. So this approximation holds.

So with gamma_A ≈ 1.563, beta_A ≈ 0.768, so option A) 0.77c.

But wait, let's check if our assumption holds. We assumed that gamma is approximately 1, which would mean that the initial momentum p_pbar ≈ m_p v_pbar.

But let's compute gamma_A more accurately.

Earlier steps:

From equation 1: 2 m_p c² =4 gamma_A m_A c².

Gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = m_p/(2 m_A).

So m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So Gamma_A = (938)/(2*300) = 938/600 ≈ 1.563.

Then, beta_A = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/(1.563)^2)).

Compute 1.563 squared: 1.563^2 ≈ 2.443.

So 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.409.

So 1 - 0.409 = 0.591.

Square root of 0.591 ≈ 0.769.

So v_A ≈ 0.769 c, which is approximately 0.77c. So option A is 0.77c.

But wait, let me think if there's another approach. What if the As are moving in pairs, two in one direction and two in the opposite, but with different velocities? Hmm, that complicates things, but perhaps the problem expects the approach I took earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is that the As all have the same speed, which may not be the case, but perhaps it's an acceptable approximation for the problem.

So I think the correct answer is option A) 0.77c.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its velocity is much smaller than the speed of light, implying that its Lorentz factor \(\gamma_{\bar{p}} \approx 1\). This simplifies the calculations.

### Key Equations and Assumptions:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before the collision is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_{\bar{p}} m_p c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2 \, (\text{since } \gamma_{\bar{p}} \approx 1).
   \]  
   After the collision, the total energy is distributed among the four \( A \)-particles:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2.
   \]  
   Equating these gives:  
   \[
   2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 \implies \gamma_A = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The initial momentum is entirely due to the antiproton:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_{\bar{p}} m_p v_{\bar{p}} \approx m_p v_{\bar{p}}.
   \]  
   After the collision, assuming all four \( A \)-particles move in the same direction (a simplifying assumption), the total momentum is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{initial}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A v_A.
   \]  
   Combining this with the energy equation allows solving for \( v_A \).

### Calculation:
1. Compute \(\gamma_A\):  
   Using \(\gamma_A = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}\), where \( m_p \approx 938 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_A = 300 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \):  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.563.
   \]

2. Relate \(\gamma_A\) to \( v_A \):  
   The Lorentz factor is related to velocity by:  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta_A^2}}, \quad \text{where } \beta_A = \frac{v_A}{c}.
   \]  
   Solving for \(\beta_A\):  
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \beta_A^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma_A} \implies 1 - \beta_A^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\gamma_A \approx 1.563\):  
   \[
   1 - \beta_A^2 = \frac{1}{(1.563)^2} \approx 0.409 \implies \beta_A^2 \approx 0.591.
   \]  
   \[
   \beta_A \approx \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.769.
   \]

3. Convert \(\beta_A\) to \(v_A\):  
   \[
   v_A \approx 0.769c.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), which corresponds to option **A**.

Answer: A
