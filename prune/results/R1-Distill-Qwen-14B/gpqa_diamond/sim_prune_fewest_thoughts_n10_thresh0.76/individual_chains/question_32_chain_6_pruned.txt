Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Now, I need to find the energy of the RHIC when this nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Relativistic energy, so I should be using the relativistic energy formulas.

The relativistic energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can calculate gamma first.

Given v = 0.96c, let's compute gamma. Let me plug in the numbers.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: Hmm, 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428... approximately 3.5714.

But wait, that seems a bit low for v=0.96c. Let me think again. Oh wait, 0.96 is
