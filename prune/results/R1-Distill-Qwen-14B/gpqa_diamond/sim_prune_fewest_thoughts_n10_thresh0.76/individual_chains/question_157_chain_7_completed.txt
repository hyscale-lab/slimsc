Okay, so I have this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Retroviruses, right? Those are viruses that use RNA as their genetic material and they have reverse transcriptase to make DNA from RNA. So when they infect a host, like humans, their RNA is converted into DNA, which integrates into the host's genome.

The question is about designing a diagnostic kit. The options involve different methods like PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR, ELISA, etc. I remember that PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction, which amplifies DNA. Real-time PCR does it with fluorescent markers, so you can monitor the amplification in real time, making it faster and more accurate for quantifying the target.

Option A suggests using nested PCR based on symptoms. Wait, but symptoms can vary, and without knowing the exact virus, how would you design the PCR primers? Plus, nested PCR is usually for when you want to amplify a specific region after an initial PCR, but maybe that's not the first step when you're identifying the virus.

Option B says to first do cDNA sequencing. Oh, because retroviruses have RNA, so the first step would be to convert their RNA into cDNA. Then sequencing that cDNA would help identify the virus. Once you know the sequence, you can design primers for a real-time PCR assay. That sounds right because real-time PCR is quick and can give accurate results.

Option C suggests DNA sequencing. Wait, but the virus is RNA-based. So unless they're talking about host DNA, which doesn't make sense for a virus. So C might be incorrect because you can't directly do DNA sequencing on the virus without reverse transcription first.

Option D is about IgG antibodies. ELISA tests detect antibodies, which are produced by the immune system. But wait, in the case of a newly emerging virus, the patients might not have developed antibodies yet, especially in the early stages. Also, ELISA can take longer and may require measuring optical density, which might not be the quickest or as accurate as PCR methods for initial detection.

So putting it together: the first step in identifying the retrovirus would involve extracting its RNA and converting it to cDNA, then sequencing to find unique sequences. With that info, you design primers for a real-time PCR kit because it's quick and can detect the virus even in low quantities. That would make option B the correct choice.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of retroviruses, which use RNA as their genetic material and require reverse transcription to produce DNA. The first step in identifying the virus would involve converting its RNA into cDNA, followed by sequencing to determine its unique genetic sequence. This sequence information is then used to design primers for a real-time PCR assay, as real-time PCR is both quick and highly accurate for detecting the virus, even at low concentrations.

Option A suggests using nested PCR based on symptoms, but symptoms can vary and are not reliable for designing specific PCR primers. Option C proposes DNA sequencing, but retroviruses are RNA-based, so DNA sequencing would not be applicable without prior reverse transcription. Option D focuses on detecting IgG antibodies using ELISA, but antibody detection may not be suitable for early-stage infections or newly emerging viruses. Therefore, the most appropriate approach is described in Option B, which involves cDNA sequencing followed by the development of a real-time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.

Answer: B
