Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry question. Let me read it again and break it down. The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Part B is about which compound can show optical isomerism.

So first, let me tackle part A. The compounds in question are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shifting of a double bond, leading to different structures. For example, in ketones, if there's a neighboring group that can form a double bond, tautomerism can occur. Wait, like enol and keto forms?

Benzoquinone—I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para and ortho. But more importantly, does it have any acidic protons that can lead to tautomerism? Oh wait, no, because quinones are cyclic structures with two ketone groups opposite each other. Benzoquinone is more about having two ketone groups in a benzene ring. So, it's a diketone. But wait, can it tautomerize?

Wait, tautomerism typically involves the formation of an enol. So, a compound must have an alpha hydrogen to deprotonate and form the enol. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. The carbonyl groups are in positions where their adjacent carbons (the alpha positions) are connected to the ring. Do the alpha positions have hydrogens?

Wait, in benzoquinone, the ring is a cyclohexadienedione. So, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups on opposite positions. The alpha carbons are the ones next to the carbonyl groups. Do those have hydrogens? Let me visualize. The ring is six-membered, and the two carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4, perhaps. So each of those carbons (like C2 and C5) is attached to another carbon in the ring. Wait, but in a six-membered ring with two ketones, the alpha positions (like C2 and C3, but wait, maybe not) might not have hydrogens. Or do they?

Wait, no, in a benzene ring, each carbon is in a position where the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. The adjacent carbons (positions 2 and 6 for the first ketone, positions 3 and 5 for the second) are connected via the ring. So, the alpha carbons (like C2 and C3) are each part of the ring and have two other ring bonds. So, each of these alpha positions would have only one hydrogen? Or maybe none?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think of the structure. Benzoquinone has the structure O=C6H4-C(=O). So, each carbon next to the carbonyl is attached to two other ring carbons. So, does that mean there are no alpha hydrogens? Because if a carbon is connected to three other carbons (two in the ring, one as the carbonyl), then it might not have any hydrogen. Or does it have one?

Wait, no, in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. So, positions 1,3,5 each have a ketone. The alpha carbons would be at positions 2,4,6. Each of these is adjacent to two ketone groups? Or wait, each is between two carbonyl groups.

Wait, wait, 1,3,5-trione would have three ketones. So the carbons at positions 2,4,6 are each between two carbonyl groups. Like, each has two adjacent carbonyl groups. So, for example, position 2 is between carbonyls at 1 and 3. So, position 2 would have a carbon connected to two carbonyls and two other ring carbons. So, is there any hydrogen on that carbon?

In a cyclic structure like cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbons adjacent to ketone groups (like positions 2,4,6) are each bonded to two carbonyl groups and two other ring carbons, right? So, each of those positions would have no hydrogens because they have four bonds—two to carbonyls and two to ring carbons. No, wait, each of those positions would have two bonds to ring carbons and two bonds to carbonyl oxygens. So, the carbon would be connected to four other atoms. So, no hydrogens there. 

Wait, but wait, a cyclohexane ring with three ketones. Each of those carbonyl groups is at 1,3,5, so each is attached to a CH2 group or something else? Wait, no—the structure is more like O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but in a ring. So, each ketone is at a different position. So, the carbons at positions 2,4,6 would each be connected to two other ring carbons and two ketone groups. So, each would have four substituents—so no hydrogens.

If that's the case, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have any alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are all part of the ring and lack hydrogens. So, without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism isn't possible because tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha position to form an enol.

On the other hand, benzoquinone. Let's think about its structure again. It's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So, the positions are 1 and 4 (or 1 and 2, but I think it's 1 and 4 in para-quinone). The carbons adjacent to the ketones (like positions 2 and 6 for the first ketone, and positions 3 and 5 for the second) are each connected to two other ring carbons and the ketone. So, do these carbons have any hydrogens?

In a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and one substituent. Wait, in this case, the substituent is a carbonyl group. So, the alpha carbons (positions 2, 3, 5, 6) would each have two ring bonds and one substituent (the ketone). So, each of these would have one hydrogen. Because, for a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to three other atoms: two in the ring and one substituent. So, each has a hydrogen.

Wait, no, if it's a benzene ring, each carbon in the ring has three bonds: two to adjacent carbons and one to a substituent. So in this case, the substituent is the carbonyl group. So each of those positions (like 2, 3, 5,6) has a hydrogen attached. So, the alpha carbons (adjacent to the ketone) have hydrogens, which would allow tautomerism.

Wait, but benzoquinone is a conjugated system. If there's a hydrogen on the alpha carbon, can it tautomerize? Let's think. For example, in benzene rings with substituents, such as in o-quinones, the positions adjacent to the carbonyl groups have alpha hydrogens. These can undergo keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, but in the case of benzoquinone, can it form enol tautomers? Let me think. The structure is O=C6H4-C=O. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups each have a hydrogen. So, for example, the C2 and C6 are attached to the first ketone (C1). Each has two ring bonds and a ketone. So, each has one hydrogen. So, the hydrogen on C2 can deprotonate to form an enol.

If that's the case, then benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism. But wait, benzoquinone is a dienone. Di-ketones can have tautomerism. So, if the molecule has alpha hydrogens, then it can tautomerize.

Wait, but in this case, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So, the carbonyl groups are opposite each other, and the four alpha positions (2,3,5,6) have hydrogens. So, can any of these hydrogens tautomerize?

Wait, the hydrogen on C2 is next to the ketone at C1, and C3 is next to the ketone at C4. So, perhaps each of these positions can lose a hydrogen to form a double bond with the adjacent ketone.

Wait, but in the case of para-benzoquinone, the two ketones are on opposite positions. So, the C2 is adjacent to C1 (a ketone) and C3 is adjacent to C4 (another ketone). So, if the H on C2 is removed, it can form a double bond between C1 and C2, but that would require the movement of that hydrogen, which would lead to an enol structure.

But wait, wait. The problem is that in the para-quinone structure, the two ketones are at 1 and 4. So, the adjacent carbons (2 and 6 for C1; 3 and5 for C4) each have a hydrogen. Each of these can potentially form an enol. So, tautomerism is possible.

Wait, but wait, when a molecule can form an enol, it's possible. So, benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism. So, which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism?

The other compound is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. As I thought earlier, the alpha carbons (positions 2,4,6) have no hydrogens because each is connected to two carbonyl groups and two ring carbons. So, no alpha hydrogens, so no tautomerism.

So, part A is which compound doesn't show tautomerism. So, the answer is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, because it lacks alpha hydrogens.

So, for part A, the correct choice is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione as the compound that doesn't tautomerize. So, option A or C would have A as cyclohexane.

Now, moving on to part B. The compounds are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. The question is which will show optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, the compound must have no plane of symmetry and have at least one chiral center.

First, let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)CH(OH)CH3. So, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxy is on the second carbon of propanoic acid. So, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Is there a chiral center here?

Looking at the structure, the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the second carbon has:

- One CH2OH group (the hydroxyl-containing carbon)
- Connected to the COOCH3 group.

Wait, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- CH2OH (the hydroxyl group)
- CH2 (from the next carbon)
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- And another CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps I should draw it. The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3 ?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So, the structure is: 

(CH3)CO-O-CH2(OH)CH3? No, wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH3
|
CH3-CH(OH)-

Wait, no. Let me correct: the propanoate ester would have three carbons. The carboxylic acid is on the first carbon. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the second carbon (CH2OH) connected to two CH2 groups, which are the same. So, the structure is:

- The central carbon (second carbon) has:
  - Two CH2 groups (one to the left, one to the right)
  - An OH group
  - A COOCH3 group.

Wait, but wait, in this structure, the second carbon (CH2OH) is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2 group)
- The third carbon (CH2COOCH3)
- An OH group
- And a single hydrogen? No, because CH2 implies two H's. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the structure is:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- One CH2 group (the first carbon: the one with the OH)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (the third carbon)
- One OH group
- One H.

Wait, so the second carbon is CH2OH, but that's actually the first carbon. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, in the ester, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In this molecule, the second carbon is CH2. So, the central carbon is the second carbon. Let me see: the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to:

- One CH2(OH)
- One CH2 (to the next carbon, which is COOCH3)
- Two hydrogens.

So, the central carbon has two CH2 groups, which are the same, an OH, and a hydrogen. So, it's not a chiral center because it's only attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. What if the structure is different? What if the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? That would be the case if the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon of propanoate. Let me consider that.

In that case, the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)-CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of propanoate, which is the middle carbon. So, the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In that case, the middle carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 group (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 group (third carbon)
- OH group
- H.

Wait, no, in that case, the second carbon would be CH(OH), with the structure:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the second carbon has:

- CH3 (from the left)
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- OH
- H.

So, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So, that carbon is a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would have optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the structure. Let me clarify: the formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3 - C(OH) - COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, propanoate has three carbons. The first carbon is the carboxylic acid group. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

COOCH3 is the first carbon. Then the second carbon has the hydroxyl group. So, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, no, this would make the second carbon CH2, which is CH2OH.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached (left and right). Therefore, it's not a chiral center because it's connected to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups), so it can't be a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, that would be something else. No, that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of 2-hydroxypropanoate as:

The molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

Wait, that would make the central carbon CHOH, attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- H.

In that case, the central carbon has four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So, that carbon would be a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would have optical isomers.

Wait, but wait which is correct? Because I'm getting conflicting conclusions depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- H.

So, four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the compound would have enantiomers.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's compare with the other option: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the cis-dimer of maleic acid. So, the structure is:

O
||
O=C-C-O-CO-O
       ||
       O=C

Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. Or wait, no, maleic acid is (Z), fumaric is (E). So, dimethyl fumarate would be the ester where the two carboxylic acid groups are esterified with methanol, giving OMe groups.

The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O=C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O=C-OCH3
O

Wait, more accurately, it's (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So, the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3).

Wait, no, wait. The correct structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a double bond and another O=C-OCH3. So, it's:

O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, I think the correct structure is:

The two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 on one end, and O=C-OCH3 on the other, connected by a double bond. So, it's:

O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but that's not correct either.

Wait, no. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So, the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH, but with a double bond. No, wait, but fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in between. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up.

Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, which has the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond. Then, the dimethyl ester would have both -COOH groups replaced by -COOCH3.

So, dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. So, it's O=C-OCH3 connected via a double bond to another O=C-OCH3.

Wait, no. The correct structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is double-bonded to another CH2 group attached to O=C-OCH3. So, it's:

O=C-OCH3
    \
     CH2-CH2
    /
O=C-OCH3

But that's not correct. Wait, the correct structure is:

The molecule has two ester groups (COOCH3) on either end of a double bond. So, it's:

O=C-OCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
O=C-OCH3

So, the structure is symmetrical. Because the two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two substituents (the ester groups) are on opposite sides of the double bond (E configuration).

Now, the question is whether this compound has any chiral centers. Hmm. The molecule has a double bond with substituents on each carbon. Each carbon of the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH3 from the ester
Wait, no. Let me think again.

Each carbon of the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group?

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3).

Wait, no, because that would imply four substituents. Alternatively, each carbon of the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH2 group which is double-bonded to another CH2 group connected to another O=C-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
      C=C
     /
O-C-OCH3
O

No, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, the structure is:

O=C-OCH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but that's actually succinic acid dimethyl ester, which is a single bond.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should proceed with the understanding that dimethyl fumarate is an ester of fumaric acid, which has a double bond between the two ester groups.

Now, considering whether this compound has any chiral centers. The double bond in dimethyl fumarate is between two carbons, each of which is attached to two COOCH3 groups and perhaps another substituent.

Wait, if the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond, then each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups, making each of these carbons connected to two identical groups. So, no chiral centers. Alternatively, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), then each carbon in the double bond is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH2 group (from the adjacent ester)
Wait, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. So, each has two identical groups, so no chiral centers.

Wait, but in the structure, each carbon of the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. So, each carbon has two identical substituents (two COOCH3 and two CH2 groups?), which would make them not chiral.

Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. So, each has two identical groups, so each carbon is not a chiral center.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but that can't be right because I thought that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Oh wait, but that's because of the double bond geometry, not because of a chiral center.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is due to chiral centers, not geometric isomerism. So, if a compound doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it has a chiral center, would show optical isomerism. So, which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me double-check.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy version would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So, the methyl ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this structure, the central carbon (CH2OH) is attached to:

- CH2 group (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- H.

Wait, so the groups are CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, and another hydrogen? No, wait, the central carbon is CH2OH, which implies two H's. So, the groups would be:

- Two CH2 groups (same)
- OH
- H.

So, the central carbon is attached to two identical groups (the two CH2 groups), so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center and can't show optical isomerism.

But earlier I thought that the structure might be different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. That would imply that the hydroxy is on the second carbon of propanoate. So, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- H.

So, the four groups are CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. All different. So, that's a chiral center. Therefore, it would exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, is that the correct structure? Because the IUPAC name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is the middle carbon.

So, the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the central carbon (second carbon) is CH2OH, which is attached to two CH2 groups (left and right), so it's not a chiral center.

But if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, that would be 3-hydroxypropanoate, not 2. Because the propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the first, then the next is the second carbon, and the third is the third carbon. So, the 3-hydroxy would be on the third carbon.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the numbering here. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, where the first carbon is the COOH, the second is the middle CH2, and the third is the CH3.

Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, the three carbons are:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH3.

Wait, no. Actually, propanoic acid is:

Carbon 1: COOH

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: CH3.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH.

So, methyl ester is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

In this structure, the second carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3 (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- OH
- H.

So, four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. Hence, it's a chiral center, and the compound has optical isomerism.

Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does have a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the structure would make the central carbon a chiral center, but in another analysis, I thought it wasn't. So perhaps the correct answer is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but the other option is dimethyl fumarate. Does it have any chiral centers?

In dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups. So, each of those carbons has two identical substituents (two COOCH3 groups), so they are not chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and can't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, between the two compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and would exhibit optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, but wait: tautomers and isomerism.

Wait, no, in part B, the options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

So, the correct choice is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism, and dimethyl fumarate doesn't.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate might not have a chiral center. But based on the correct IUPAC name, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which has a chiral center.

So, the part B answer would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. For dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical because the two ester groups are on either end of a double bond, each with the same substituents. So, it has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

But for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if it has a chiral center, then it will show optical isomerism.

Putting it all together:

Part A: The compound that doesn't show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, looking at the options:

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

But wait, part B's correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the options should have B as that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

So, the correct answers for A and B are:

A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Which matches option A.

Wait, but let me check again:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Yes, that's correct because part A is cyclohexane, part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the correct option is option A.


To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties related to tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (alpha carbons) have hydrogens, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism. Therefore, benzoquinone exhibits tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The carbons adjacent to the ketones (positions 2, 4, and 6) are each bonded to two ketone groups and two other ring carbons, leaving no hydrogens. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism is not possible. Thus, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. The carbons in the double bond are each bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3 and CH2), so there are no chiral centers. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.
