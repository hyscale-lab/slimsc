Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the options given.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me visualize that structure. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2).

Wait, actually, benzene ring numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think. The substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, so they are adjacent. Since the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, the ring must have them in a meta configuration? Or wait, no, since 1,2,3 would be adjacent in a way that substituents are next to each other. Hmm, but I need to focus on the order of reactions.

So starting from benzene, I'll need to introduce each substituent one by one. Benzene is generally introduced with substituents via electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which substituents are introduced can affect the positions where subsequent groups attach because of directing effects.

The substituents I need are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let's think about their directing effects. 

- Nitro groups are meta directors.
- Ethoxy groups (OCH2CH3) are activating (since O is more electronegative but the lone pairs can activate) and are ortho/para directors.
- Tert-butyl groups are strong activating groups (they're bulky though) and are typically ortho/para directors because they are electron-donating via the inductive effect, but wait, wait. Actually, tert-butyl is an alkyl group, so it's an activating group and directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Wait, but nitro groups are deactivating (meta directors). So when I add a nitro group, it will deactivate the ring and direct incoming groups to the meta positions relative to it.

But let me think about the target compound. The substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Wait, the positions are 1, 2, and 3. So if I imagine the benzene ring, substituents are in adjacent positions. Let me perhaps sketch it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that substituents are in a meta arrangement because in the target, the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the order of reactions.

Let me plan the possible order. Since nitro groups are meta directors, if I add nitro first, then the next substitution would be meta to it. But wait,
