Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed when the potential energy is fully converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are a bit different. Let me think through this.

The problem gives me a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh right, in relativity, energy considerations change because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² as in classical mechanics.

So, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kx². But wait, in relativity, maybe the potential energy is treated differently. Or perhaps the total energy is still quantized similarly, but the kinetic part uses the relativistic formula.

Wait, the total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the potential energy at maximum amplitude, right? Because at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, and all energy is potential. 

So, E = mc² + (1/2)kA². 

When the oscillator is at x=0 (the equilibrium point), all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E - mc². But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy is not (gamma -1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the total energy E is gamma * mc². 

So, E = gamma * mc². But E is also equal to mc² + (1/2)kA². Hmm, maybe I should set these equal. Let me write that:

gamma * mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²).

Let me denote the term (kA²)/(2mc²) as some variable to make it easier. Let’s say (kA²)/(2mc²) = a. Then,

gamma = 1 + a.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Squaring both sides,

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + a)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Let me compute this:

v²/c² = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding the numerator: (1 + 2a + a²) - 1 = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.
