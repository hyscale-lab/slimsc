Okay, so I've got this question about some rotavirus experiment and what process is happening. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

So, the setup is that they're tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they're giving these to mice orally via gavage. I remember that rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis, so it makes sense they're looking at how it affects the mice.

They observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Wait, I think stomach acid is really strong, like HCl, right? So maybe the GFP was broken down or something. But some made it through and got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Oh, secondary lymphoid organs include things like Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines, I believe.

They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cell population. So, these must be the immune cells that are responding to the rotavirus. They're looking at the variable heavy chain gene and seeing high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests something is causing the genes to change, right?

Now, the question is about which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Hmm. I need to recall what each of these processes does.

Somatic hypermutation occurs in B cells during the immune response. It increases the diversity of the antibody variable regions by introducing point mutations. This usually happens after the B cell is activated by an antigen and is part of affinity maturation. So if the variable heavy chain gene has high variability, this could be it.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. I don't think that directly causes changes in the variable regions of antibodies.

Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't change the variable regions. So high variability in variable chains wouldn't be from class switching.

VDJ recombination happens during the generation of the initial B cell receptor. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined to create the variable region. But this happens during B cell development in the bone marrow, not in response to an antigen. So if the cells are isolated after exposure to rotavirus and show high variability, it's not VDJ because that's already set.

So putting this together: the cells are likely activated B cells in the Peyer's patches. They've been exposed to the rotavirus, so they're undergoing an immune response. High variability in their variable heavy chain suggests they've undergone mutations. That points to somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but wait. Do Peyer's patches contain B cells that undergo somatic hypermutation? I think Peyer's patches are part of the mucosal immune system, and they do have B cells. When an antigen is presented there, the B cells get activated. Once activated, these B cells would undergo proliferation and then undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the affinity of their antibodies.

Another thought: when they sequence the variable genes and see high variability, that suggests that each cell's gene is different, which is exactly what happens during hypermutation as each B cell lineage mutates its own V regions.

So the process must be somatic hypermutation. So the answer is A.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins become entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene of these cells reveals high variability, suggesting a process that alters the variable regions of antibodies.

To determine the process, the options are analyzed:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response. It introduces point mutations into the variable regions of antibodies to increase diversity and affinity for antigens. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene aligns with this mechanism.
  
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly alter the variable regions of antibodies, making it unlikely.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variable regions, so it does not explain the observed variability.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during the initial development of B cell receptors in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined. It does not account for the variability observed in response to rotavirus exposure.

Given that the experiment involves an immune response to rotavirus and the observed variability in the variable heavy chain gene, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in activated B cells to enhance antibody diversity and specificity.

Answer: A
