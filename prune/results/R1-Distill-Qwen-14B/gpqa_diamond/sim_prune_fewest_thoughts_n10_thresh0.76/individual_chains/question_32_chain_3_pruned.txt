Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a specific nucleus to reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light. Nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I remember that when dealing with particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play. So I probably need to use the relativistic energy equations. The kinetic energy, or the total energy, depends on the gamma factor.

The total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So first, let's compute gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me write that down. v = 0.96c. So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

Then, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Taking the square root of 0.0784. Let me compute that. The square root of 0.0784 is... Hmm, 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that accurately. 1 divided by 0.28. 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/(28/100) is 100/28 which is 25/7. Let me calculate that: 25 divided by 7 is about 3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus X is needed to compute the energy. The nucleus is Li-6. So the atomic mass unit (u) would be helpful here. The mass of Li-6 is approximately... Let me recall, the atomic mass of Li is about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but wait, that's the molar mass. To find the mass of a single nucleus, I think it's better to use the atomic mass in u.

Wait, I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units. But wait, actually, the exact value might be a little different. Let me think: The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but since Li-6 is a specific isotope, perhaps it's a bit less. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the molar mass in kilograms. Because 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-2
