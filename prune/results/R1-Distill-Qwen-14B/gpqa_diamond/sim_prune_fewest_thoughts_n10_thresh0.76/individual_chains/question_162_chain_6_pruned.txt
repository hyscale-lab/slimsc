Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? So it's probably in two dimensions. Oh, and pseudosphere—so I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like the hyperbolic equivalent of a sphere.

Wait, the metric has a term 4 - x² - y² in the denominator. So let me see: the general form of a metric in two dimensions is usually something like ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + dθ²), but this one is expressed in terms of x and y. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's in isothermal coordinates or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's written in a way that suggests a conformal metric, meaning it's a multiple of the flat metric (dx² + dy²). Oh, right, because the metric is conformally flat since it's multiplied by a scalar function.

In that case, the metric can be written as ds² = e^{2φ(x,y)} (dx² + dy²), where φ is some function. Here, the scalar is 32/(4 - x² - y²), so e^{2φ} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So φ = (1/2) ln
