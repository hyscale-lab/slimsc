Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler than the rest. The star is rotating, so when we observe it, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations—this is called rotational modulation. The problem says that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. Now, the question is asking: if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve?

The options are A to D, with various numbers. Hmm.

I remember that the light curve of a star with spots behaves a bit like a planet transit. When a planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, when a spotted region rotates into view, it can cause a change in brightness because the spots are darker than the rest.

Wait, but in this case, the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of our view. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere into our line of sight, the brightness would decrease because the spots are cooler and emit less light. So the brightness variation is due to the change in the star's apparent brightness as the spotted area rotates in and out of view.

But the problem states that without the spots, the same amplitude would be caused by an exoplanet. So we need to compare the two scenarios: the star with spots (simulating a planet) and find the planet's radius that would cause the same dip.

First, I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about how the brightness change works. The star's total brightness is the sum of the flux from all areas, considering their temperatures and coverage.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux than the unspotted regions. The effective brightness variation comes from the difference between the spotted and non-spotted states.

Wait, let's model this. The star has a radius R, same as the Sun. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 20% of one hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, 20% of that is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the entire area of spots is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R² / 2) = 0.1 π R². So the total area covered is 10% of the entire star's surface (since the entire surface is 2π R²). So the filling factor is 10% of the whole star.

But
