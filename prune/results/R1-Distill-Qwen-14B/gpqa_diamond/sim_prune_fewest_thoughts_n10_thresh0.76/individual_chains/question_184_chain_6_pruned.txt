Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. Benzene ring with substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. So numbering the ring, let's say position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Oh right, benzene rings are numbered such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So, substituting the positions:

Position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3)
Position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3)
Position 3: nitro (NO2)

So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So the ring looks like this: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl next to it at 2, and nitro at 3. Wait, but wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering can be done in a way that the substituents are at positions 1,2,3? That would make them meta to each other, but wait, 1,2,3 are adjacent positions. So actually, the substituents are all adjacent around the ring, making a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For benzene, numbering starts at any position, but the substituents should have the lowest possible numbers. So if I have substituents at positions 1,2,3, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But I think that's possible only if the substituents are in adjacent positions, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, etc. So three substit
