Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Interesting. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c². I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what's going on here. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe that implies that the system's energy isn't too high, but I'm not sure how that plays into it. Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. That might simplify some calculations.

Wait, but in particle physics, when particles annihilate, they produce other particles. So this is a matter of conservation of energy and momentum. Oh, right, because momentum and energy must be conserved in any interaction.

Since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, I should figure out their energies and momenta. But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the proton is at rest? Or is the system's center of momentum frame relevant here?

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton. Oh, but wait, the proton is moving
