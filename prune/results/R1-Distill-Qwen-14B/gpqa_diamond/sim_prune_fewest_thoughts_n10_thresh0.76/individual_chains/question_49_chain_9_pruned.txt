Okay, so I've got this problem about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I've studied some organic chemistry, but I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll take it step by step.

The first reaction is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to give product A. Hmm, so I remember that the Cope and Claisen rearrangements are sigmatropic, but this doesn't look like either. Wait, maybe it's an example of a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement?

Wait, wait. Let me think about the starting materials. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the amine. Structure-wise, that's (CH3O)2CH-NH2. But wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH2OH. Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3? No, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2-OH. Wait, no, wait. The formula for but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2-OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2-OH? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. But-3-en-2-ol: The double bond is between C3 and C4, but since it's but-3-en-2-ol, that would be CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but numbering starts from the end. But-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on C2 and the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but but has four carbons. So positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=C(2)-CH2-OH? No, wait. Maybe
