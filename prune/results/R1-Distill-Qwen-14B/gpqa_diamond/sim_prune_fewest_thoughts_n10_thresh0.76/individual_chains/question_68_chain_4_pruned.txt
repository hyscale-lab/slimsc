Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I'll need to think through this step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So, when the magnetic field changes, the system's state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of S_z.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes too. The initial state is an eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian, but when the Hamiltonian changes, the system will no longer be in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, leading to time evolution and possible oscillations.

The initial magnetic field is along +Z, so the initial Hamiltonian should be H_initial = -μ·B_initial. Since μ = γ S_z, and B is along Z, H_initial = -γ S_z B. So the initial eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along Z.

But wait, the magnetic moment is given by mu = γ S_z, so the energy is E = -mu·B, which is -γ S_z B. So yes, H_initial is proportional to S_z.

Now, when the field is turned off and another along +Y is turned on, the new Hamiltonian H_final is proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic field is now along Y, the new energy is E = -μ·B, which becomes -γ S_y B.

Wait, but the new Hamiltonian is H = -γ B S_y. Because B has the same magnitude but direction changed to Y.

So the system goes from being in an eigenstate of S_z (since initial H was along Z) to a state that's not an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian H_final. So the state will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the average z-component of the particle’s moment, which is ⟨S_z⟩. So I need to find how ⟨S_z⟩ oscill
