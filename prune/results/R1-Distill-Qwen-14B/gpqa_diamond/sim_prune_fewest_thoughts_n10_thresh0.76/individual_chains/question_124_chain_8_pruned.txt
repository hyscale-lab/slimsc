Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles produce new types that are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the detector's inner walls. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with relativistic effects, maybe time dilation or length contraction. Wait, since the particles are moving at a high speed, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be longer due to time dilation. That would allow them to travel farther before decaying, right?

Let me think. The particles are created at the center of the detector. They have a certain mean lifetime in their rest frame, say tau. But in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma times tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So, the distance they can travel before decaying is their speed multiplied by gamma tau. Since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So distance D = c * gamma tau.

Wait, but the detector's radius is 30 meters. So the maximum distance a particle can travel to reach the inner walls is 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the wall, the product gamma tau must be such that c*gamma tau >= 30 meters.

But wait, in the initial scenario, one third of them reach the walls. So that implies that the average distance they travel is enough for one third to make it. Hmm, maybe I should model it with the decay probability.

The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/(tau)). But since t is gamma times t0 (t0 being the proper time), and t = gamma tau' where tau' is the proper lifetime. So the probability of surviving until time t is exp(-gamma t0 / tau')? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up here.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles have a certain decay length. The decay length is c*gamma*tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. So the probability that a particle decays before traveling distance L is 1 - exp(-L/(c gamma tau)). Wait, no: the probability that it hasn't decayed by distance L is exp(-L/(c gamma tau)), right? Because the number of decay events is proportional to the time passed, which is L/(c gamma tau).

Wait, maybe the survival probability is exp(-L/(c gamma tau)). So the particles that reach the walls (L=30m) have a survival probability of exp(-30/(c gamma tau)). So in the initial setup, the Lorentz factor is 20, and one-third of the particles reach the walls. So that means the survival probability is 1/3.

So let me set up the equation: exp(-30/(c *
