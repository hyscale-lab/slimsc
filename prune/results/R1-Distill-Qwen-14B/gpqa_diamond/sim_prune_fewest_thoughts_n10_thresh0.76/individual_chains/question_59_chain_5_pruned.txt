Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, here we have two acids (CH3COOH and HCl) and a base (Ba(OH)2). So, I think the first thing I should do is calculate the moles of each acid and base to see how they react.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution. Moles are calculated as concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L).

First, CH3COOH (acetic acid) is 500 mL of 0.1 M. Wait, 500 mL is 0.5 L. So, moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl is 400 mL of 0.2 M. 400 mL is 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but wait a minute. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions when it dissociates. So, for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH-.

Similarly, HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+ ion. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but in the initial mixing, I think I can consider the H+ it contributes.

So, when these are mixed together, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. Let's figure out the total H+ and OH-.

First, total H+ ions from the acids:
HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H+.
CH3COOH contributes 0.05 moles of H+ (since it's a weak acid, but in the first approximation, maybe we can consider it as contributing 0.05 moles, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no. Wait, since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely, so the actual H+ from CH3COOH is less than 0.05. Hmm, but maybe in this problem, when mixed with strong acid and a strong base, the H+ and OH- will first neutralize each other, and then any excess will determine
