Okay, so I've got this question here about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 times that of the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have their own masses and radii too. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question is about their equilibrium temperatures. The options are given, and I need to find the ratio of Planet1's temperature to Planet2's.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember it's related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh right, but the albedos are the same for both planets, so that part cancels out in the ratio.

So the key factors are the star's temperature, the planet's distance, and the star's radius. But wait, I think the star's radius comes into the luminosity calculation. Because the star's luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So R_star is part of the luminosity, which affects the planet's equilibrium temperature.

But wait, the planet's distance is the main variable here. How do I find the distance of each planet from the star? Oh, the question mentions the RV method. The RV shift gives information about the planet's mass and its orbital period, but perhaps the RV method gives the velocity, which relates to the mass and the distance via Kepler's laws.

Alternatively, the transit method gives the radius of the planet relative to the star, but the RV method gives the mass. Wait, but the question gives information about the forbidden line shifts. Oh right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's motion caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift gives the velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the distance.

So let's model this. The RV shift (v) is given by the formula: v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that simplifies things. Also, the planets are probably much less massive than the star, so M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

But perhaps a better way is to relate the RV velocity amplitude to the planet's mass and distance from the star.

Alternatively, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star's reflex motion. So K is given for each planet. Wait, the question says Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å and Planet2 0.04 Å. But wait, the shift is in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. So the shift in wavelength is delta_lambda = 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for the respective planets.

But to get the velocity, we can use the formula delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But wait, the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03, so v = (0.03 / 6300) * c, where c
