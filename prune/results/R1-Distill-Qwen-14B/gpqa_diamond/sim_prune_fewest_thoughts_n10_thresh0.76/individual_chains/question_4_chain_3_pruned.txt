Okay, so I'm trying to answer this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, let's think. The question is about a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. So in our world, magnets always have both poles—like how a bar magnet has two ends, north and south. But in this other universe, you can have a magnet with just one pole, like isolated North or South. That's interesting because in our universe, that's impossible due to the way magnetism works.

Maxwell's equations are four in total, right? Let me recall them. The first one is about the divergence of the electric field, Gauss's law for electricity. The second is about the curl of the magnetic field, Faraday's law of induction. The third is Gauss's law for magnetism, which says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. And the fourth is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, involving the curl of the electric field.

Wait, so in our universe, Gauss's law for magnetism (third equation) states that the divergence of B is zero. That's why isolated magnetic poles don't exist. Because if you have a divergence, that would imply sources or sinks of the magnetic field, which would be monopoles. So if in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles, then Gauss's law must be different.

So in our world, the third equation is ∇·B = 0, which is why monopoles can't exist. But in this universe, maybe ∇·B isn't zero. So that equation would change.

Now the options are about which equations are different. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me look at them again.

Option A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's the third equation. If monopoles exist, then ∇·B isn't zero anymore. So this equation would change.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. Wait, the circulation of the electric field is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which is the fourth equation. So ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. And the divergence of B is the third equation. So if in this universe, the third equation is different and maybe the fourth isn't? Or are both affected?

Wait, but the existence of magnetic monopoles would affect the other equations too. Let me think. Maxwell's equations are interconnected. If there are magnetic monopoles, then Gauss's law for magnetism (∇·B = 0) changes. Also, Ampère's law would need to change because it relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. Or wait, maybe the other way around.

Wait, in our universe, because ∇·B =0, there are no magnetic charges. If monopoles exist, then ∇·B would equal the magnetic charge density, right? So the third equation would change. What about Faraday's law? Faraday's law is about the curl of E being equal to the negative rate of change of B. But if there are magnetic charges, how does that affect Faraday's law?

Wait, perhaps the Maxwell-Faraday equation (the second equation) would also have to change. Because if there are magnetic monopoles, then you
