Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem involves some organic chemistry concepts, specifically dealing with mixtures that undergo certain reactions. Let me try to break down the information given.

First, there's a mixture X which is equimolar and consists of two liquids. It decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water is a test for unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes. So mixture X probably contains compounds with double or triple bonds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) under heating, a new mixture Y is formed. Mixture Y is also equimolar but consists of two other liquids. The key here is that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, whatever reaction happened must have removed the unsaturation. Maybe hydrogenation? But wait, the question says it's a result of disproportionation. Oh wait, no, wait. Because when you heat with Pt, that's usually a catalyst for addition reactions, like hydrogenation. But if it's a disproportionation reaction, that's a redox reaction where one species is both oxidized and reduced. Hmm, but mixture Y doesn't have the ability to decolorize bromine, meaning no double bonds left. So perhaps the starting materials in X had some functional groups that, upon reaction, formed others without double bonds.

Wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. So, the starting material (probably one of the components in X) is undergoing a disproportionation. For example, maybe an alkene is undergoing some kind of reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one of the components is a diene or something that can split into different products.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y, using Pt under severe conditions, gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28%. Let's calculate what that could be. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, the molecular formula might have 7 times the hydrogen mass. Let me think, hydrocarbons are C and H. So, for a molecule with formula CnHm, the mass percent of H would be (m/(12n + m)) * 10
