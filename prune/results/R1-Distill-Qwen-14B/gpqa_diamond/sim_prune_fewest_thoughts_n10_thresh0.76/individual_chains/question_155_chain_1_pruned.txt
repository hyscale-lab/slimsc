Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ − ⟨P_z⟩²). Right? So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, are these the components in the eigenbasis of P_z? Because the problem says the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. So yes, this state is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That should make things easier because when the state is in the eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So, the matrix for P_z is given. Let me write that out to visualize it better. P_z is a diagonal matrix because it's in its eigenbasis. The diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. From the problem, the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), the second is (0,0,0), and the third is (0,0,-ħ). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the matrix is:

P_z =
[ ħ   0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the three basis states, respectively.

The given state is a column vector ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. But wait, are these coefficients in the eigenbasis of P_z? Yes, because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. So each component corresponds to the amplitude in each eigenstate of P_z.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The state ψ is a linear combination of the basis vectors, which are the eigenstates of P_z. So ψ = c1|p_z=ħ> + c2|p_z=0> + c3|p_z=-ħ>, where the coefficients are c1=-1/2, c2=1/sqrt(2), c3=-1/2.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, the expectation value, we compute the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Let's compute |c1|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |c2|² is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. |c3|² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ) ) = 0. Oh, interesting, the expectation is zero.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal and squared, the eigenvalues become their squares. So P_z² has eigenvalues (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the variance is ΔP_z² = ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 = 1/2 ħ².

Taking the square root gives ΔP_z = sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) sqrt(2)ħ
B) ħ/sqrt(2)
C) ħ/2
D) ħ

So option B is ħ/sqrt(2). That's what I got. But wait, let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the state is a column vector. I should make sure that it's normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squared magnitudes.

|c1|² + |c2|² + |c3|² = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

So the expectation value of P_z is zero. And the expectation of P_z squared is (1
