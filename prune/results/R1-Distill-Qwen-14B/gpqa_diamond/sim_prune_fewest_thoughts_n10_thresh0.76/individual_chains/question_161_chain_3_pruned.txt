Okay, so here's the problem. Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV, which is pretty high, so I guess that means the electrons are moving really fast. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible because that should help with the electron microscopy by reducing scattering.

But even after doing all that, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them, so Mike figured out the mean free path of these gas molecules is λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? So in the ultra-high vacuum, λ1 is probably pretty large because the pressure is so low, so molecules don't hit each other much.

Then, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes—it's now λ2 instead of λ1. But the temperature in the sample compartment didn't change, so that shouldn't affect the mean free path, right? Because the mean free path depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. If temperature is the same, then pressure is the main factor here, perhaps.

Wait, but the pressure in the sample compartment is still the same because the pumps are running, right? So why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Hmm. Oh wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas. Because high-energy electrons can interact with the gas molecules. Could that cause some kind of ionization or charging of the gas molecules?

So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might get charged. If they become charged, the mean free path would change because charged particles interact differently. Uncharged gas molecules (like in the initial case) can collide with each other and the walls, but charged ones might feel electric fields or other forces. But wait, in the ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is already long because the pressure is low. So the main factor would be the number of collisions.

Wait, but what if the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize? Then, those ions or electrons would behave differently. The ions have a charge, so they might interact more with the walls of the chamber or get attracted to the electron beam source. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the gas pressure indirectly.

Wait, but in the scenario, Mike accurately determined the mean free path λ1 before the electron beam was turned on. So the initial mean free path is based on the gas pressure, temperature, and volume. After turning on the beam, the mean free path becomes λ2. But because the temperature is the same, the only variable here would be pressure. If the mean free path changes, that implies that the effective pressure has changed.

But wait, if the electron beam is causing some of the gas to be removed or ionized, maybe the effective pressure decreases. Because if some molecules are ionized and pumped away, the pressure would drop, which would increase the mean free path. Because mean free path λ is proportional to 1/(P * sqrt(M)), where P is pressure and M is the molecular mass. So if pressure decreases, λ increases.

Wait, but in the problem
