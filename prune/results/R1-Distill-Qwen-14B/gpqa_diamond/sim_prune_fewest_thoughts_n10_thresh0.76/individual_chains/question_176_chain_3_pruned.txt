Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about measuring observables P and Q on a system. Let's see what the question says. 

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, right? Oh, but wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute its norm. The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. So I think I need to normalize it first. So the actual state vector would be 1/sqrt(6) multiplied by (-1, 2, 1). Wait, the question says the state is given by that column matrix, but maybe it's implicitly normalized. Or perhaps I should proceed with that vector as is, but I think in quantum mechanics, the state has to be normalized. So I'll proceed by considering the normalized state. 

So the state vector |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T divided by sqrt(6). Let me write that down. So |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1; 2; 1 ].

The problem states that someone measures P and then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

So, okay, the steps would involve first measuring P, then Q. The probability of getting 0 in P is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, after that, the state collapses to that eigenvector. Then, we measure Q on this new state, and find the probability of getting -1.

Wait, but wait, I think the measurement of P can collapse the state into an eigenstate of P. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

So the operator P is given by the matrix:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2),
