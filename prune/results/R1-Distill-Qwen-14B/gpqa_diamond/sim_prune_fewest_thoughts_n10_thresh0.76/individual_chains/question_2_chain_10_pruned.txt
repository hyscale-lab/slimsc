Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Then, each product is formed through a series of reactions, and I need to find out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Hmm, I should probably break this down into each reaction step. Let's start.

First reaction: trans-cinnamaldehyde treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1.

Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)H. Oh wait, no, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, right? So it's benzaldehyde substituted with a propenyl group. Specifically, I think it's (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no, wait. No, the structure of cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO
