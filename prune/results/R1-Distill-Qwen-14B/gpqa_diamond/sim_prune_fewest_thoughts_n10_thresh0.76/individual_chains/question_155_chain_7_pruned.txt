Okay, so I'm trying to find the uncertainty ΔP_z for the operator P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what the uncertainty principle says. The uncertainty ΔP_z is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨Ψ| P_z^2 |Ψ⟩ - ⟨Ψ| P_z |Ψ⟩²). Oh wait, right, because uncertainty is the square root of the variance.

But wait, is the state an eigenstate of P_z? No, the state is an eigenstate of P_x. So the expectation value of P_z isn't necessarily zero. Hmm.

Wait, but the basis vectors given are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the P_z basis. Let me think. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So each component corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z.

So the three basis states are |+ħ⟩, |0⟩, and |-ħ⟩, I suppose. Because P_z has eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ. Because looking at the P_z matrix: first row is [ħ, 0, 0], so the first basis vector must be an eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ. Third row is [0, 0, -ħ], so eigenvalue -ħ. The middle row is [0,0,0], so eigenvalue 0.

So the state Ψ is a combination of these three. The components of Ψ are: the first component is -1/2, second is 1/sqrt(2), third is -1/2.

But wait, let me verify. The state is a column vector ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). So in the basis of P_z's eigenstates |1⟩, |0⟩, |-1⟩, the state is Ψ = (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/√2)|0⟩ + (-1/2)|-1⟩.

Wait, but the components are in the order (first row, second, third) of the matrix. So for
