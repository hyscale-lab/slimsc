Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, let's see what I can remember.

The question is about the state |3,0,0> decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I need to figure out the possible transition routes and their probabilities, given the options A to D.

Wait, so the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. Since it's a two-step process, each step is a dipole transition. I remember that in dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1.

So, the first transition from |3,0,0> needs to go to a state that follows the selection rules. Let's think about possible states it can transition to. The initial l is 0; so after transition, l can be 1 (since Δl=±1). So the possible l for the intermediate state is 1.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to some n', l=1. What's the possible n'? Well, n can change by any integer, but in reality, for hydrogen, it's usually lower by 1 or so, but since it's a two-step decay, maybe it's not going directly to n=1, but perhaps through n=2.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. The first step could be to |2,1,m>, but wait, what's the selection for m? Δm is 0, ±1. So initial m is 0, so next m can be -1, 0, or +1.

Hmm, so possible intermediate states after first transition are |2,1,m>, where m is -1, 0, or +1.

Wait, but for the first transition from |3,0,0>, the possible intermediate states are |n', l=1, m= m_initial ±0, ±1. So l must be 1.

So, the possible first transitions are to |n', 1, -1>, |n',1,0>, |n',1,1>.

But what about n'? From n=3, transitions can go to n=2 or n=4, etc.,
