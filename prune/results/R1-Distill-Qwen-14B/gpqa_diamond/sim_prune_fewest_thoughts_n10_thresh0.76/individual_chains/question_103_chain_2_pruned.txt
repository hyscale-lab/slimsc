Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is asking which sequence of reactions will lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A to D, each with a series of reagents.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, ethan-1-one is acetone, so the structure should have an acetone group attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the ring are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering the positions can be a bit confusing. Let me sketch this out.

So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. If I imagine the ring, position 1 is where the acetone is attached. Then, moving clockwise, position 2, then 3 (bromo), 4, 5 (nitro), and 6. So the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to the acetone group.

Now, synthesis steps. Benzene is the starting material. The substituents we need are bromine and nitro groups, and the acetone group. I need to think about how to add these in the correct order, considering directing effects of substituents.

Nitro groups are meta directors. Bromine is an ortho/para director, but if it's already on the ring, it will influence where the next substituent goes.

Wait, but wait. The target has both a nitro and a bromo substituent, so the order in which they are added matters because each substituent directs the next substitution.

Also, the acetone group (ethan-1-one) is an acyl group attached to the benzene. So, when adding the acetyl group, we need to do it via Friedel-Crafts acylation. But Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. So, the ring must have activating groups when we perform the acylation.

But nitro groups are deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, if we add nitro groups too early, they might deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts acylation difficult because the ring isn't reactive enough.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation is done on aromatic rings that are activated. Because if the ring is deactivated, the reaction won't proceed. So, if the benzene has a nitro group, which is meta-directing and deactivating, then adding the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts might not be possible because the ring is deactivated. So, the order of adding substituents is crucial.

So, perhaps the correct order is to first add the acetyl group, then add the nitro and bromo groups. Because the acetyl group is an activating group (it's an electron-donating group via resonance), it will direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions relative to itself.

Wait, but wait. Acetyl group is an activating group? Wait, no. I think I might be getting this mixed up. Friedel-Crafts acylation adds an acyl group to benzene. The acyl group is a meta director? Or is it ortho/para? Wait, acyl groups are meta directors because they are deactivating (due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group). So, after adding the acetyl group, the next substituents would come in the meta position relative to it.

Hmm, but wait. The acetyl group is a meta director. So, the first substituent after acylation would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl.

Wait, the target molecule has the nitro group at position 5 and bromo at position 3. If the acetyl is at position 1, then nitro is at 5, which is meta to 1 (since 1 to 5 is three positions apart in a ring). Similarly, position 3 is meta to position 1 (positions 1, 2, 3: 3 is meta relative to 1). So that aligns with the substituents being added into the meta positions after the acetyl group.

So, the plan is:

1. Acetylate benzene to get acetophenone (phenyl ketone). So, using a Friedel-Crafts acylation reagent, like CH3COCl with AlCl3 as catalyst.

2. Then, add the nitro group in the meta position relative to the acetyl. So, nitration would happen next. The nitration of acetophenone would add a nitro group in the meta position.

3. Then, add the bromine in another position. Wait, but wait. After adding the nitro group, the ring has two substituents: acetyl at position 1 and nitro at position 3 (assuming we added nitro in meta to the acetyl). Now, adding bromine requires a directing group. Nitro is a meta director, and acetyl is a meta director as well.

Wait, but in a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can direct each other. So, when adding the third group, the directing will depend on the positions and types of existing substituents.

But let me think: after acetylation (position 1) and nitration (position 3), the next substituent would be bromine. Where would it go?

Wait, the target has the bromo at position 3 and nitro at 5. Oh, wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong earlier. Let me re-examine the target structure.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached to the phenyl group, which has bromo at position 3 and nitro at 5.

So, the benzene ring has substituents at 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at 1.

So the positions are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2).

So, after acetylation (position 1), next, we need to add the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group. So the nitration would be meta to the ketone.

But wait, after acetylation, the ring is activated towards further substitution
