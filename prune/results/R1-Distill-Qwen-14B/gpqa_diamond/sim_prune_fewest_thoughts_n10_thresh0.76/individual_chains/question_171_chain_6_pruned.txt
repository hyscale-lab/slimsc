Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that bromine typically acts as an electrophile in these reactions, so we're probably talking about bromination here. The question is about the para-isomer yield for each substance, and we need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para product.

Wait, the question says that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each will add a bromine somewhere on the ring, but the position depends on the directing groups present.

Let me list the substances again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyl ethyl ester)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

I think the key here is to determine the directing effects of each substituent and how that affects the position where bromine adds. Also, for each substituent, determine if it's meta or para directing, and whether the ring is activated or deactivated.

The para-isomer's weight fraction would depend on the directing group. If a substituent is a strong activating group, it would direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. If it's deactivating, it would direct to meta positions.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about each substituent:

1) CH3 (toluene): methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So bromine would add mainly to the ortho and para positions. But since it's a single substituent, the major products would be the o and p isomers. However, the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So for toluene, the para would be one of the major products.

2) COOEt (benzoyl ethyl ester): the carbonyl group is an electron-withdrawing group. So it's deactivating and meta-directing. So bromine would add primarily to the meta positions. So the major product would be the meta isomer, so the para would be a minor product.

Wait, but waitâ€”wait, the group is COOEt, which is an ester. Esters are definitely deactivating because of the carbonyl, and they are meta directors. So para would be a minor isomer here.

3) Cl (chlorobenzene): chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group (due to electronegativity) but it's ortho/para directing because of its lone pairs. Wait, but wait. Chlorine is an interesting case. It's a deactivating group because of the inductive effect (electron withdrawal), but it's ortho/para directing because of its resonance effect (lone pairs can donate electrons into the ring when the leaving group leaves). So substituents like Cl are ortho/para directors but deactivating. So bromine
