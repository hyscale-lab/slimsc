Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism, specifically when a compound has chiral centers. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups, right? So those compounds can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, causing them to rotate plane-polarized light.

Let me look at each option one by one.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing different numbers.

First, the compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

I'll go through each.

1. Compound 1: It's a biphenyl structure with substituents. The formula is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro something. So the biphenyl has two nitro groups on each ring at the 6 and 6' positions, and two carboxylate ester groups (O-CO-OCH3) at the 2 and 2' positions. Now, biphenyls can have either ortho, meta, or para substituents. Wait, but the substituents here are at 6 and 6' which... Oh wait, [1,1'-biphenyl] would have the two rings connected at position 1 and 1', right? So positions 2,2' would be adjacent to the connecting point. Hmm, but does the structure have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, the substituents are at 6 and 6'. Let me think about the structure. The biphenyl has two rings connected at C1 and C1'. So each ring is numbered such that the connecting carbons are at 1 and 1'. Then, 6 and 6' would be on the opposite side? So on each ring, positions 2 and 6 would be on opposite ends? So if substituents are at 6 and 6', perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a way that causes the molecule to be chiral.

Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe this is a case of geometric isomerism (cis-trans), but that's for double bonds, not biphenyls. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but for isomerism, we're talking about structural isomerism. Oh wait, no, optical isomerism is about stereoisomerism, so either because of chiral centers or because of some other kind of asymmetry.

Wait, but without a chiral center, a molecule can still be chiral if it has a plane of asymmetry. Like in biphenyls with certain substituents. Oh right, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetric, it might be chiral.

So for compound 1: It's a dimethyl ester, so two ester groups are at 2 and 2' positions. Then
