Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probabilities. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows some kind of exponential law. Wait, isn't the decay probability related to the concept of half-life or something like that?

The question says that an atom's decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, in 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it decays. That probably means that the decay constant is calculated based on that probability.

Wait, right, the decay probability in a given time is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the probability that the atom has decayed by time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt). So if 32% have decayed in 100 minutes, that means P(100) is 0.32.

So, I can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Rearranging, e^(-λ * 100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logs on both sides, I get -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Let me calculate that. ln(0.68) is approximately what? Well, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.
