Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have three solutions mixed together:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (hydrochloric acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (barium hydroxide)

Hmm, right. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many moles of H+ and OH- ions are present in each solution, then see how they react when mixed.

Let me start with each solution one by one.

First, CH3COOH is a weak acid. Its formula is CH3COOH, so each molecule can donate one H+ ion. The concentration is 0.1 M, and the volume is 0.5 L. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but I think when dealing with such reactions, sometimes we can consider the initial moles before any reactions happen. But wait, maybe the strong acid and strong base reactions will affect this. Hmm.

Next, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each HCl gives one H+ and one Cl- ion. The solution is 0.2 M, 0.4 L. So moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. That contributes 0.08 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit releases two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-. So the concentration is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, they neutralize each other. So the OH- will react with the H+ from the acids. So the H+ will come from both CH3COOH and HCl. But CH3COOH is a weak acid; does it contribute a significant amount of H+ compared to the strong acids?

Wait, in this case, HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate all its H+. The CH3COOH, being weak, might not donate all its H+; but in the presence of a strong acid, maybe the weak acid doesn't contribute much initially? Or perhaps the reaction is more about the neutralization between the strong acid and strong base first, and then see what's left.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait,
