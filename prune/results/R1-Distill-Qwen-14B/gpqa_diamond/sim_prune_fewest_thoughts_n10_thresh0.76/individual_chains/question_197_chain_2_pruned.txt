Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start breaking it down.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound. I need to determine what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data, then see how it reacts under those conditions.

First, let's look at the IR data. The strong peaks are in the regions of 3400–2500 cm-1, which often indicates an -OH group (stretching for O-H) or maybe an alkyne (sp C-H stretch), but 3400 is more typical for -OH. Then, there's a peak at 1720 cm−1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, or maybe an amide. But since there's no mention of amide groups elsewhere, I'll consider it as a carbonyl from something else. The 1610 and 1450 cm−1 regions might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. Let's list the peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because in DMSO-d6, the -COOH proton typically appears around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. So this might be a carboxylic acid group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. In aromatic regions, this usually corresponds to protons ortho to a substituent. Like in para-substituted benzene rings. For example, in a para-substituted benzene where two protons are adjacent to the substituent, they would be split into a doublet.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. This could be the other two protons in the para-substituted benzene, para to the substituent. So, maybe the benzene ring has a substituent that's in the para position, causing the two sets of doublets. The coupling between these protons leads to these doublets. So the ring might be something like 4-substituted, with two substituents across from each other, but wait, the substituent on the ring could be another group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are downfield at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. That suggests that the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups, which would deshield the protons and cause them to appear downfield. For example, a carbonyl group like a ketone or an acid would do that. So maybe the substituent is a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid group.

Looking further down, there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). A multiplet around 3 ppm could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe an oxygen. Or perhaps it's a CH next to a carbonyl group, like in a ketone or ester.

Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, two protons. This could be a CH2 group that's part of an alkyl chain, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl. Maybe part of a carbonyl-CH2-CH2- structure.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of three protons. That suggests a CH3 group adjacent to a CH that's split into a doublet. So maybe a -CH(CH2CH3) group or something like a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) where the CH has a CH3 attached. Alternatively,
