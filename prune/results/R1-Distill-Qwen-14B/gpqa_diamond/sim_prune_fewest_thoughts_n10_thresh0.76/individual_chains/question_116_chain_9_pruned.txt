Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound D is. Hmm, let's take it step by step. 

First, the question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that triplet and quartet splitting usually comes from neighboring protons. So, 6H as a triplet—maybe that's from two equivalent CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2. Wait, like maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something. So, for the triplet at 0.9, which is usually around where CH3 groups resonate. If there are 6H, that's two CH3 groups. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—quartet suggests three neighboring protons, so maybe a CH2 next to another CH2? Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to a CH that's next to another CH2. Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to another CH2. Let me think—like (CH2CH2)2O or something. Oh wait, maybe it's diethyl ether? No, diethyl ether would have a triplet and a quartet, but the integration would be different. Wait, diethyl ether has an NMR with a quartet for the CH2 near the oxygen and triplet for the CH3. But in this case, the triplet is 6H, which would be two CH3 groups. So each ethyl group contributes 2 CH3 (each 3H) and the quartet would be for the CH2 connected to the oxygen, which is 4H in total (each CH2 has 2H, but if there are two CH2 groups, that would be 4H). So, is compound A diethyl ether? Wait, but diethyl ether's NMR would have a quartet for the CH2-O, integrating to 4H, and the triplet for the CH3, integrating to 6H. Oh yeah, that fits. So A is diethyl ether, CH3CH2OCH2CH3.

Wait, but wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3. So, the NMR would show the CH3 groups as triplet because they're next to a CH2. The CH2 groups next to oxygen would be quartet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. So yes, that fits the description of A.

Then, A undergoes monobromination to form compound B. Monobromination of diethyl ether—how does that happen? Diethyl ether isn't usually brominated easily, but I think under certain conditions, like using NBS (N-bromosuccinimide) in presence of light, but wait, diethyl ether is more likely to undergo elimination rather than substitution because it's a good leaving group. Or perhaps it's a radical bromination. Oh wait, diethyl ether can undergo bromination via a radical mechanism when exposed to Br2 and light. So the most stable radical would form, which would be the tertiary radical. So, the ethyl groups are CH2CH3, so when bromine adds, it would probably add to the more substituted carbon. Wait, but diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. The possible sites for bromination would be the central oxygen's adjacent carbons. But in radical bromination, the more substituted carbon (the terminal CH2CH3) isn't the most substituted. Wait, no—each oxygen is connected to a CH2CH3. So the possible sites for bromination would be the CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. So, the structure would become CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3? Because the CH2 adjacent to O is more likely to form a stable radical when bromine attacks.

Wait, but radical bromination tends to occur at the most stable radical position. The central O has two CH2CH3 groups. So each CH2 near O is a primary carbon. Wait, wait—no, each CH2 is connected to the O and to another CH3. So perhaps when the Br adds, it's more likely to add to the primary carbon? Or maybe the transition state leads to the bromine adding to the primary CH2. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure. So, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So when bromine adds, it's probably via a radical mechanism, adding Br to one of the CH2 groups. Since each CH2 is connected to the O and another CH3, the radical would form on the CH2, then Br adds. So the product would be CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3. So that's mono-brominated diethyl ether.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But diethyl ether is not a great substrate for SN2 because the leaving group (which would be the O-) isn't a good leaving group. So substitution is unlikely. So radical bromination is more plausible. So, in that case, the major product would be 1-bromo-2-ethoxyethane or something.

So compound B is (CH2BrCH2OCH2CH3). Now, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, possible reactions: elimination or substitution. Since B is a bromoalkane adjacent to an oxygen atom, perhaps it's more likely to undergo elimination to form an ether or something else. Wait, no, B is mono-brominated diethyl ether. So structure is CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3.

Reaction with alcoholic KOH: so, KOH in ethanol. The conditions favor elimination, possibly E2 mechanism. So, the H and Br would be removed in a concerted step, forming a double bond. The base would abstract a β-hydrogen, causing the bromide to leave and form a double bond between the two carbons. So, the structure would become CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. Wait, but that's an ether with a double bond adjacent to the oxygen. Wait, but that's an allyl ether? Or more accurately, an ether where the oxygen is adjacent to a double bond. Or perhaps it's a diene. Let me think—if the starting material is CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3, eliminating HBr would form CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So, that's the structure of C. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain with an ether linkage. No, wait, the starting material is (CH2CH2BrO)CH2CH3? Wait, no, no. Wait, the initial compound after bromination is (CH2BrCH2O)CH2CH3? No, wait, no—diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So after bromination, it's (CH2BrCH2O)CH2CH3. So when KOH removes H and Br, it's the adjacent CH2 groups that lose H and Br. Wait, the structure is CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3. So, the Br is on the CH2 next to the O. So when elimination occurs between the CH2Br and the adjacent CH2-O, we get a double bond between those two carbons. That would form CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So, that's an allyl ether, right? Or perhaps it's a diene. Wait, but the structure is CH2=CHOCH2CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So, that's 2-pentene-1-yl ethoxy? No, let me count the carbons. Wait, the structure after elimination would be CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So, the molecule is (CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3). So, that's an ether with a double bond next to the oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's 3-pentene-1-ol but no, that's not right.

Wait, but the problem says that compound C has two geometrical isomers. So, the structure of C must have a double bond with substituents on either side. If C is CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon would be H and OCH2CH3 on the first carbon, and H and CH2CH3 on the second. Wait, no, the structure is OCH2CH3 on the first carbon? Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So, the first carbon (CH2) is attached to the oxygen and a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it out. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So, the double bond is between the first and second carbons. The substituents on each carbon are:

- First carbon: one H, one OCH2CH3, and two CH2 groups (but wait, no, it's CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So the first carbon (left side of the double bond) is CH2, attached to the O. The second carbon is CH-O-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of substituents around the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is attached to two H's and an OCH2CH3 and a CH2 group? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So, the double bond is between the first and second carbon in the chain. So, the first carbon is CH2 connected to the oxygen (O-CH2-CH2-CH3?), no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to a cyclic ether? No, because the starting material is diethyl ether, which is a linear molecule. So, the elimination
