Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Let me start by recalling what I know about electric potential energy and conducting spheres.

So, the setup is that there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. And I need to find the potential energy of this system.

Hmm, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's electrons redistribute themselves. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will be neutralized by the Earth. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, a grounded conducting sphere means that the sphere is connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow into the Earth. So when a charge q is placed near the sphere, the induced charges on the sphere are such that the sphere's own charge is adjusted until equilibrium is reached.

Wait, but the sphere is initially neutral, right? Because it's just a conducting sphere. So when the charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the charges can flow in or out. So the induced charges will cause the sphere to have an induced charge, but because it's grounded, the net charge on the sphere might not be zero. Or wait, wait. No, wait. Let me think.

No, wait, when you have a conducting sphere and you bring a charge q near it, the charges in the conductor (which were initially at rest) will redistribute. The sphere is neutral, so when q is brought near, the electrons in the sphere will move towards the side opposite to q. Since the sphere is grounded, these electrons can leave the sphere, so the sphere would end up with a charge opposite to q. Or does it?

Wait, no. If the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow into the Earth. So if the sphere is initially neutral, and a positive charge q is placed nearby, the sphere's electrons (negative charges) will be attracted to the region near q. Because the sphere is conducting, these electrons can move, but since it's grounded, excess electrons can leave the sphere, right? So the electrons leave the sphere and go into the ground, leaving the sphere with a positive charge. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the sphere's induced charge becomes equal and opposite to the charge q. But since the sphere is connected to the
