Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem starts with compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of hydrogens and the splitting can tell us about the structure.

Let me think about the triplet. A triplet usually comes from neighboring with two protons. So if we have 6H as a triplet, maybe that's two equivalent CH3 groups next to a CH2. Because each triplet in that case would be from each CH3. Wait, wait, but if it's a triplet, each peak is split by two neighboring protons. So perhaps the 6H are two methyl groups attached to a CH2. Because, like, if you have a CH2 group connected to two CH3 groups, each CH3 would see the CH2's two Hs and split into a triplet. So 6H as triplet â†’ two CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet suggests each H is next to a group with three H, maybe a CH2 next to a CH3 or something else. Wait, but wait, a quartet for 4H. Wait, quartet is when a proton is next to three equivalent protons. So maybe they are each adjacent to a CH3 group. Or maybe it's a CH2 next to another CH2, but that might be a triplet. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. The quartet is for 4H. So each of these four H must be adjacent to a group with three H. What structure could that be? Maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH(CH3)2 or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the 4H are part of a CH2CH2 group where each is adjacent to a CH3. Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH2- group attached to something else.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet comes from a group like CH2 connected to a CH(CH3)2. Wait, but if the quartet is 4H, perhaps it's a CH2CH2 where each CH2 is next
