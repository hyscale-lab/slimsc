Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. Let me draw it mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think: the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent? No, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 would be meta to each other? Wait, no, if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's adjacent in a row. Hmm, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a straight line of three carbons. So the structure would have substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the order would be ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro as you go around the ring.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the substituents and their directing effects. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, and the substituents can be activating or deactivating, and meta or para directors.

So for the synthesis, the steps involve adding these groups. The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

I recall that nitro groups are strong meta directors and deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group, which is an electron donor) and is an ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky group; it's an activating group because alkyl groups donate electrons through inductive effect but are bulky. So tert-butyl is a good ortho/
