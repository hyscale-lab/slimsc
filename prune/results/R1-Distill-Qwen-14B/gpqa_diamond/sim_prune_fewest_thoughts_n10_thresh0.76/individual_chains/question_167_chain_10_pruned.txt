Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>) / N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh right, because when you have a superposition of coherent states, the normalization comes from the inner product.

Wait, the parameters here are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So I'll need to plug those in. First, maybe compute N. Let me compute sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So the expression under sqrt becomes 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2). Let's compute exp(-2*0.25) which is exp(-0.5). I remember that e^(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So 1 + (-1)*0.6065 is 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935). Let me calculate that. Square root of 0.3935 is about 0.6275.

So the state is normalized as 1/N. Now, the state is a superposition of two coherent states with amplitudes alpha and -alpha. Coherent states are Gaussian, so the superposition might lead to non-Gaussian features.

The measure of non-Gaussianity here is the relative entropy del_b, which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Wait, wait. Oh no, no, I think I got that wrong. The relative entropy (also called Kullback-Leibler divergence) between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). Wait, but the question says it's defined as [trace(rho ln rho)
