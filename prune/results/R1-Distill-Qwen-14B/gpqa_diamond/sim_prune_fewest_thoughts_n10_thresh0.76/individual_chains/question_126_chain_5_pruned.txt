Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through each part carefully.

The problem says an organic chemist does two reactions, and then combines the products. Then, these combined products are run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks they'll see in each case.

First, let's look at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reaction uses LAH (which is Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. I remember that ketones are typically reduced by LAH to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone group in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one will become a secondary alcohol. So the product from Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but waitâ€”it depends on the structure. The molecule is hexan-3-one, so it's a six-carbon chain with the ketone on carbon 3 and a methoxy group on carbon 5. When reduced, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH-OH group. So the product should be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with the configuration depending on the starting material. Since the starting material is S configuration at that carbon, I think after reduction, the configuration might change, but wait, LAH as a reducing agent usually doesn't change the configuration because it's a ketone. Wait, no, wait. The structure: the starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is on C3, which is a carbonyl group (O). When it's reduced with LAH, the carbonyl becomes a CH2 group. Wait, no. Wait, when you reduce a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol. So, regardless of the configuration, the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, the ketone is at C3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait no, let's number. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH
