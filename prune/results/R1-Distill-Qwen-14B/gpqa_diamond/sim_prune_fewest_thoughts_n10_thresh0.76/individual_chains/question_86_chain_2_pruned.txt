Okay, I need to solve this problem about the proper starting materials for two reactions. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there's a chemist who did two reactions with two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, wait. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ (probably acid workup), and the second uses BH3 and H+.

Wait, the products are both (R) and (S) forms? Or are the products the same but the starting materials different? Let me check the question again.

Oh, the products are different: the first reaction gives (R)-4-ethyl..., and the second gives (S)-4-ethyl... So the starting materials must have different configurations leading to these enantiomers.

The question is asking which starting materials A and B are correct. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different configurations for A and B.

I remember that when you reduce a ketone with a borohydride, you can get different stereochemistry depending on the reducing agent. Wait, wait, no. Wait, BH3 is typically used for ketone reductions, but wait, no, BH3 is a strong reducing agent, but when used in certain conditions, like with THF, it's a hydride source. Wait, but LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3, or is it the other way around? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than NaBH4. For ketones, both can reduce them, but maybe in terms of stereochemistry, there's a difference. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an aldehyde or a ketone, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material was perhaps a cyclic carbonyl compound, maybe a lactone or something else.

Wait, looking at the product: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The structure is a six-membered ring (pyran is a six-membered oxygen ring), with the ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4. The ring is tetrahydro, meaning it's saturated (
