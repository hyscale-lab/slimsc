Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with compound A, leading through B, C, and finally to compound D. The goal is to identify what D is, based on the given options.

First, let's break down the information given for each compound.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting and integration can tell us about the structure. 

The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H suggests this is likely a CH3 group attached to something that splits into a triplet. Wait, CH3 groups usually show up around 0.9 ppm. So maybe it's two sets of CH3 groups. The 6H makes me think of two CH3 groups, but how?

Wait, the triplet. For a triplet, the neighboring protons must be two, right? So each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2. Because if each CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two protons, the triplet would come from coupling with two neighboring protons. So, perhaps the structure is something like (CH3)2CH-CH2-CH2- something. Or maybe a di-substituted group, like a ethyl group.

Wait, the 6H as triplet and 4H as quartet. Let's think. If we have two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2, that would be (CH3)2CH-CH2... but wait, let me think of a common structure. Oh, maybe a diethyl group. But wait, if it's two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, that would be a CH2CH3 group. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is that of a neopentyl group or something else. Let's think about the integration. 6H as triplet and 4H as quartet.

Wait, another approach: the triplet for 6H suggests two equivalent CH3 groups. So maybe each is attached to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. So, like CH2CH2CH3... No, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait,
