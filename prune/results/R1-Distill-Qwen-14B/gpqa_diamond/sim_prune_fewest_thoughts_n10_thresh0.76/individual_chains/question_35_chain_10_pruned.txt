Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h divided by 4π. And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row as (0 -i) and the second row as (i 0). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators are often represented by matrices. For spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons, the spin matrices are the Pauli matrices. Oh, wait, the S matrix here looks familiar. The Pauli matrices are usually σx, σy, σz. Let me check: σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which matches the S matrix given here. So S must be the σy Pauli matrix.

So, S is σy, which is a 2x2 matrix. Then Ay = c * S. And c is h/(4π). Wait, I recall that the spin angular momentum operator S for a spin-1/2 particle is given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Because ħ is h/(2π). So, S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli vector. So, if c is h/(4π), then c equals ħ/2? Let me see: h/(4π) is the same as (h/(2π)) * (1/2), which is ħ * (1/2). Oh wait, because ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2. So c = ħ/2.

So Ay is (ħ/2) * σy. Then, the operator Ay is (ħ/2) times the Pauli y matrix. 

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So, the eigenvalues a will be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of σy. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay will be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1). 

Wait, but what's ħ? ħ is h/(2π). So substituting that, a = (h/(2π)/2) * (±1) ) → a = h/(4π) * (±1). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). 

Looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts of ±2πh and real parts ±h/4π. But wait, the eigenvalues a are real numbers because Ay is Hermitian. Because S is Hermitian, and c is real, so Ay is Hermitian. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. So options A and B suggest complex eigenvalues, which can't be right. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, S is σy, which is Hermitian. Because σ
