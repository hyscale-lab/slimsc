Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a good starting point. The NMR data is provided, so I'll need to figure out the structure based on that. The reagents given are a series of reactions: first, NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aq KOH with heat. So, the starting material undergoes these reactions, and I need to find the final product.

Let me start by analyzing the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H
- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H
- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H

I remember that the aromatic region is between 6.5-9 ppm, so the first two sets are likely aromatic protons. The triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, that's a triplet. Aldehydes are usually singlets, so maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, another possibility is an alpha proton, like a ketone adjacent to an aromatic ring or something with neighboring protons. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde with coupling to adjacent protons.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of equivalent protons in the aromatic ring. Maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if there are two substituents on the benzene, each causing the adjacent protons to be doublets.

Wait, but the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Broad singlets can be tricky; maybe it's an -OH group, but that's usually a broad peak around 5 ppm or so. Wait, but that's 6.27, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated double bond, like a vinyl proton, but they usually are in the 5-6 ppm range. Hmm, maybe it's a more deshielded proton, like adjacent to an oxygen or an electron-withdrawing group.

The 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H is probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe it's an OCH2 group. Alternatively, it could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl group.

So, putting it all together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -10)/2 = 4. So four degrees: likely two double bonds (or one double bond and a ring) plus a ring. Alternatively, maybe three rings and a double bond, but that's less likely. Probably, one ring (like a benzene) and a double bond, or another ring.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde proton suggests a carbonyl group. Also, the OCH2 group could be part of an ester or a ketone. Wait, but the molecule has an O in the formula, so likely an alcohol, ether, or carbonyl group.

Since the molecule has an aldehyde proton (if that's what the 9.72 ppm peak is), that would account for a carbonyl group
