Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Benzene has six carbons, so substituents add up to 2 more, making the total 8 carbons. Wait, wait. The compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so two substituents, each of which contributes their own carbons. So each substituent probably has one carbon each, or one substituent has two and the other has none? No, wait, it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So two substituents each add a certain number of carbons.

Wait, the total is 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 2 carbons. So two substituents, each contributing one carbon? Like two methyl groups or something.

But wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one of the substituents must be a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), and the other is a carbonyl group. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an acyl group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The aromatic-halogen bond suggests that the substituent is a halogen directly attached to the benzene ring. Like Cl, Br, I. So substituents are a halogen (X) and something else that includes a carbonyl group.

So substituents are X (halogen) and another group, let's say R, which has a carbonyl.

So R must have a carbonyl. What groups have a carbonyl? Like ketones, aldehydes, esters, amides, etc.

So if the substituents are X and R, where R has a carbonyl, let's think about possible structures.

But wait, the molecule has 8 carbons in
