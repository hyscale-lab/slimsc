Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from quantum field theory and loop diagrams.

I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process in perturbation theory. Each loop typically contributes a certain factor in the calculation. Oh right, the superficial degree of divergence can help determine the number of loops, but in this case, the question is about the number of loops directly.

Wait, the expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to break this down. Let's see what each part signifies.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0), but in natural units, maybe it's just e^2. So alpha is proportional to e squared.

G is the coupling constant for some interaction, like the strong force perhaps? The g squared part would come into play for interactions involving that force.

The sqrt(2) and 8 are just numerical factors. The denominator (4pi)^6 is interesting. 4pi often comes into play in loop integrals because of the integration over solid angles, especially in higher dimensions.

Wait, the number of loops is usually connected to the power of the coupling constants and the number of integrals. For a Feynman diagram, each loop brings in an integral over momentum, and in dimensional regularization, each loop would involve a (4pi)^epsilon factor, but maybe here it's more about the factors of (4pi)^n.

Alternatively, the number of loops can be determined by the number of vertices minus the number of propagators plus the number of connected components, but that's for counting loops in a diagram. Alternatively, in terms of perturbation theory, each loop adds a certain power of the coupling constants.

Wait, another approach: the overall scaling with energy. The term (Q/M)^2 suggests a ratio of some energy scale Q over another M. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to the number of loops.

Wait, think about the general form of loop integrals. Each loop contributes a factor of (4pi)^d, where d is the dimension. But in four dimensions, each loop integral has a 4pi factor. So for a loop diagram, the denominator would have higher powers of (4pi) depending on the number of loops.

Wait, but each loop integral in four dimensions typically contributes a (4pi)^epsilon factor when using dimensional regularization, but perhaps more importantly, when doing loop integrals, each loop brings in a factor of 1/(16 pi^2) per loop because the integral over d^4k would involve a volume factor of (2pi)^4, and when you have a loop integral, you often get 1/(16 pi^2) per loop due to the integration measure.

Wait, so each loop contributes a 1/(16 pi^2) factor. Let me see the denominator in the expression: (4 pi)^6. So (4 pi)^6 is (4^6) * pi^6.

Wait, 4^6 is 4096. Let me see, 4 pi squared would be (4 pi)^2 = 16 pi^2. So (4 pi)^6 is (16 pi^2)^3. So 1/(4 pi)^6 would be 1/(16 pi^2)^3.

Each loop contributes a 1/(16 pi^2), so if we have three loops, that would be (1/(16 pi^2))^3, which is 1/(16 pi^2)^3. But wait, our denominator is (4 pi)^6, which is (4 pi)^6 = (4^6) pi^6 = (4^6 pi^6) = (4^3 * 4^3) pi^6 = (64 * 64) pi^6. Wait, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, each loop gives a 1/(16 pi^2) factor, so if there are L
