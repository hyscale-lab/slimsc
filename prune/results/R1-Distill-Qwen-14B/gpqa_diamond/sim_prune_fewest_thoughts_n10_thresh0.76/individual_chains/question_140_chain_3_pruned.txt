Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. The scenario goes like this: X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X, producing a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Oh, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm, the question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. And the options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Let's break this down piece by piece.

First, let's think about Substance X. The fact that it incorporates a heavier isotope suggests that X is an element with at least two isotopes. But wait, no, X is a substance, so maybe it's a compound. Or maybe X is an element itself, but with a heavier isotope present. Hmm. Wait, the problem says X is a substance, but also refers to its constituent elements. So X is a compound made of elements where one has a heavier isotope.

In organic chemistry, commonly used reagentsâ€”maybe X is something like NaOH or KOH? Or perhaps another strong base. Because when you have a violent reaction with a liquid, it could be a reaction like acid-base. Let's think about reactions where a metal hydroxide reacts with an acid, releasing gas.

Wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for W's molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 protons (from O) and 10 neutrons (since O is usually 16, which is 8 protons and 8 neutrons, but wait, H2O's molecule is H2O. H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: O has 8, each H has 0, so 8. So protons (10) not equal to neutrons (8). Doesn't fit.

Wait, another gas: CO2. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6 (assuming carbon-12), each O has 8, so 6 + 16 =22. Wait, that's same as protons. So W is CO2? Because 22 protons, 22 neutrons. That's a possibility.

But wait, CO2 is a gas, yes. So if W is CO2, let's see what gas is released when a base reacts with an acid. Oh wait, if X is a base like NaOH reacting with an acid, perhaps H2SO4, but that might produce water and sulfuric
