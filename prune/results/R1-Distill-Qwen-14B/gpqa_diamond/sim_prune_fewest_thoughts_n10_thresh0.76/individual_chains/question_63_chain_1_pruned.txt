Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

First, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be where the rotational quantum number J is 0 and the vibrational quantum number ν is 0, right? So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it's moving to the next higher energy state.

Wait, but what's the next possible state? I think that the energy levels are quantized, and transitions can be either vibrational or rotational. The next lowest state after the fundamental could involve a change in the vibrational or rotational state, but I'm not entirely sure which one it is. Oh wait, the question says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy—that probably means the smallest possible energy increase. So I think the transition would be the one that requires the least energy, which is usually a change in the vibrational state, because the vibrational energy gaps are larger than rotational ones. Or wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational. So the first transition would be a vibrational one. But wait, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe it's considering both rotation and vibration together. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can change its vibrational state or its rotational state. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. But wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (ν=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state could be either a higher vibrational state (ν=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Which of these requires less energy?

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vibrational = (ν + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between ν=0 and ν=1 is h w. 

For rotation, the rotational energy levels are E
