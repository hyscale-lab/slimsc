Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again.

The problem says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? We assume the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

The options are A to D. Hmm. Right, so I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) is a measure of how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

Wait, the problem is about the concentration of free calcium ions. Because in the solution, the EDTA is complexed with Ca, so the free Ca²+ concentration would be low. I think we can use the formation constant expression to find it.

The Ca-EDTA complex is stoichiometric, which I think means it's in a 1:1 ratio. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The formation constant K is given as 5x10^10. Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

Now, the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are both 0.02 M before complexation. Wait, no, maybe I should think about it in terms of the complex formation.

Let me think: the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-. So initially, before any dissociation, the concentrations would be [CaEDTA^2-] =0.02 M, and [Ca²+]=0, [EDTA]=0. But wait, that's probably not the right way to approach it because the complex can dissociate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium). Let me try that.

Let me denote the complex as [CaEDTA]^2-. The dissociation reaction is:

[CaEDTA]^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^
