Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let's try to tackle it step by step. The question is about evaluating a volume integral involving the divergence of a vector field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on vector calculus, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So, f(r) is a vector that points radially outward or inward, and its magnitude is 1/r². Wait, actually, the problem says it's 1/r², but the field is along the radial direction. So in spherical coordinates, f(r) would be (f_r, 0, 0), with f_r = 1/r².

The question is to find the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. So I need to compute the integral of ∇·f over that volume.

I remember from Gauss's Law in electromagnetism, but wait, this is a general vector calculus problem. The integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. Oh right, that's the Divergence Theorem. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector to the surface.

So for a sphere of radius R, the surface is at r=R. The vector field f(r) has only a radial component, which is f_r = 1/r². So at r=R, f_r = 1/R². The outward normal vector n on the sphere's surface is in the radial direction. So the flux through the surface is f · n multiplied by the area element.

Wait, let's compute that. The flux would be f_r * r² sinθ dθ dφ, since in spherical coordinates, the area element is r² sinθ dθ dφ. But wait, n is a unit vector, so f · n is just f_r. So the flux is f_r multiplied by the area of the sphere.

Alternatively, let me think. The flux ∫∫ f · n dA is equal to f_r at R times the surface area of the sphere. Because n points radially out, so f · n is f_r
