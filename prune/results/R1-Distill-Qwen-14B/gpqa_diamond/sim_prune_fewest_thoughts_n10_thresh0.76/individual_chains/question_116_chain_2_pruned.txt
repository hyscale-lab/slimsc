Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR showing two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means two neighboring protons, like in a CH2CH3 group. The quartet would be a triplet of triplets? Or maybe something else. Wait, quartet implies three neighboring protons, maybe from a CH2CH2CH3 group? Or perhaps from another structure.

The integration gives 6H for the triplet and 4H for the quartet. So maybe the molecule has two sets of equivalent protons. Let's think about structures. If the triplet is 6H, that's probably two CH3 groups. Like, maybe (CH2CH3)2. Then the quartet is 4Hâ€”could be two CH2 groups? So perhaps the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CH2. Wait, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Or perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to something.

Wait, NMR shifts: 0.9 ppm is typical for CH3 groups, especially in ethyl groups. The quartet at 1.3 ppm would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH3. For example, in ethyl groups, the CH3 is a triplet (split by the adjacent CH2), and the CH2 is a quartet (split by the two CH3). So if the quartet is 4H, that's two sets of 2H each. So maybe the structure is two ethyl groups attached to something else. Because each ethyl group has 2H on the CH2. So two ethyl groups would give 4H as a quartet. So, perhaps the structure is something like diethyl ether? Or maybe a diethyl group attached to a carbonyl or another carbon.

Wait, diethyl ether would have two ethyl groups attached to an oxygen. But the NMR would show a triplet and a quartet. Let me think: in diethyl ether,
