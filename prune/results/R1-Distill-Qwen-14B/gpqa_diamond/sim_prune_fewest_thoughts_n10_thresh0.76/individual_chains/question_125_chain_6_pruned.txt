Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down and think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, I remember that this is similar to the 3D harmonic oscillator where each direction (x, y, z) contributes equally because it's isotropic.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy eigenvalue. Oh wait, so I need to find both the energy value and the degeneracy (the number of states) for the third excited state.

I think the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Alternatively, since it's three-dimensional, the total quantum number n can be defined as n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy becomes E = ħω (n + 3/2).

But wait, in some formulations, the energy levels are given in terms of the principal quantum number N, which is n + something. Oh yeah, wait, no. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, each state is specified by three quantum numbers (n_x, n_y, n_z), all non-negative integers. The energy depends only on the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So different states can have the same n and thus the same energy, which leads to degeneracy.

Now, the ground state is when n=0 (n_x = n_y = n_z =0). The first excited state would be the first state above the ground state, which has n=1. But wait, the question is about the third excited state. Let me clarify: the ground state is the zeroth excited state. So the first excited state is n=1, the second is n=2, the third is n=3.

Wait no, that's not correct. Because the ground state is the lowest energy state, the first excited state is the next higher energy, which would correspond to n=1. The second excited state would be n=2, and the third would be n=3. So the
