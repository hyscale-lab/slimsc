Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance with orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so the periods are in that ratio. So if Planet_1 has period P, then Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, and so on.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. They have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the ratio. Equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and their albedo. The formula I remember is T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π² * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is luminosity, a is albedo, and D is the distance from the star. But since all planets have the same albedo, a cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, but the planets are in orbital resonance, so their orbital periods are in those ratios. But their distances from the star would depend on their orbital periods because of Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ D³. So D = (P²)^(1/3) = P^(2/3) multiplied by some constant, but since we're looking for the ratio, the constants will cancel out.

So, for each planet, D is proportional to P^(2/3). So the distance ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 depends on the ratio of their periods raised to the 2/3 power.

Wait, let me clarify. Planet_2 has a period of 2P (if Planet_1 is P), and Planet_4 has a period of 3.5P. So the ratio of their periods is (3.5P)/(2P) = 3.5/2 = 1.75. So the ratio of their distances D4/D2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3).

But wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance, right? Because the temperature formula can be rearranged. Let me think. From the formula, T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Since L and (1-a) are the same for both planets, the ratio of T4 to T2 would be (D2/D4)^(1/2). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

Wait, no, wait. Let's get this right. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4)

But another way I remember is that T is proportional to ( L / D² )^(1/4). Because L is the star's luminosity, which is proportional to R_star^2 * T_star^4. So putting it all together, T is proportional to ( (R^2 T^4) / D² )^(1/4) ) = T_star * (R/(2D))^(1/2) * (1 - a)^(1/4). But maybe a simpler approach is to consider that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L / D^2)^(1/4), since all else is constant.

So T ∝ L^(1/4) / D^(1/2). But since L is the same for both planets (assuming they orbit the same star), the ratio of their temperatures T4/T2 would be (D2/D4)^(1/2).

Wait, no. Wait, T is proportional to 1 / sqrt(D), because D is in the denominator. So if D4 is larger than D2, T4 would be
