Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that in 2D metrics, sometimes they represent spaces like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on the signature. Oh wait, this is probably a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's got dx² and dy² terms, so two spatial dimensions.

So, in general, the line element for a 2D surface can be written as ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), where g(x,y) is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, more accurately, the metric is usually diagonal in this form, so the line element is often given by ds² = f(r) (dr² + dθ²), but here it's in terms of x and y. Perhaps it's better to think in terms of polar coordinates because x² + y² would be r², which might make it easier to see.

So let me switch to polar coordinates. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then x² + y² = r². So the denominator becomes 4 - r². The metric becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So in polar coordinates, this is a standard form for a 2D metric.

Wait, what kind of geometry does this represent? The function in front, 32/(4 - r²), depends on r. So when r approaches 2, the denominator becomes zero, and the metric blows up. That suggests a singularity at r=2. Hmm, but wait, the numerator is 32, so as r approaches 2 from below, the coefficient becomes very large, making the area around r=2 highly curved.

Wait, thinking about the line element, if I set r² = 4 - something, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, maybe this is an example of a metric in conformally flat coordinates. Because the metric is written as a multiple of the flat metric (dx² + dy²), so it's conformally flat.

The area of the surface would be calculated using the area element. In 2D, the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric. Wait, no, the area element in 2D for a metric ds² = f(r) dr² + g(r) r² dθ² would be sqrt(f*g) dr dθ. But since the given metric is in the form ds² = E dr² + G dθ², where E = 32/(4 - r²) and G = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). Wait, because (dx² + dy²) in polar is dr² + r² dθ², so each term is multiplied by 32/(4 - r²). Therefore, E = 32/(4 - r²), and G = 32 r²/(4 - r²).

So the determinant of the metric tensor in (r,θ) coordinates would be E * G because it's diagonal. Wait no, the determinant of the metric tensor is E * G', but wait, the metric tensor in diagonal form is diag(E, G). So the determinant is E * G. Wait no, wait, wait. Let me clarify: in 2D, the metric tensor components are g_rr = E, g_θθ = G. The determinant is g_rr * g_θθ, because the off-diagonal terms are zero. So det g = E * G.

Wait, but the area element in 2D is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. So sqrt(E * G) dr dθ is the area element. Let's compute E * G: E is 32/(4 - r²), G is 32 r²/(4 - r²). So E*G = (32 * 32 r²)/( (4 - r²)^2 ). Wait, but sqrt(E*G) would be sqrt( (32^2 r²) )/(4 - r²)^2 )^0.5. Let me compute that.

sqrt( (32^2 r²) ) = 32 r. And the denominator is (4 - r^2). So sqrt(E*G) = 32 r / (4 - r^2). Hmm, but that's the area element. So the area is the integral over r and θ.

Wait, but what are the limits of integration for r and θ? Because the metric is defined when the denominator is positive, so 4 - r² > 0. So r² <4, which implies r < 2. So r goes from 0 to 2. And θ goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π, of the area element. So:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Wait, but let me compute this. Let's first compute the inner integral over r, then multiply by the integral over θ.

The inner integral is ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So -du/2 = r dr. The limits when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

∫ (u=4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) / u ].

Which is the same as ∫ (u=0 to4) [32 * (du/2) / u ].

Because flipping the limits changes the sign.

So 32/2 = 16, so 16 ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du.

Wait, the integral of 1/u is ln |u|, so:

16 [ ln(4) - ln(0) ]

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral diverges. So the inner integral is infinite, which makes the area infinite as well.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius 2. Maybe I'm missing something about the nature of the metric.

Wait, maybe I got the pseudosphere confused with something else. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? In 2D, it's like the tractricoid, and it has finite area but infinite perimeter. Hmm, but in this case, the metric's area is coming out infinite, which would correspond to option D, which is +infty.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution or the setup. Let me double-check.

The area element is 32 r / (4 - r²) dr dθ. So integrating r from 0 to 2, θ from 0 to 2π.

Wait, so the inner integral is ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me compute that again. Let u = 4 - r², so du = -2r dr → -du/2 = r dr.

Then when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So ∫ (from 4 to 0) [32 * (-du/2) ] / u = ∫ (0 to4) (32 * (du/2) ) / u.

Which is 16 ∫(0 to4) (1/u) du = 16 [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

Which becomes 16 (ln4 - ln0). But ln0 is -infty. So ln4 - (-infty) = +infty. So the integral is infinite.

Which means the area is infinite. So the area is D) +infty.

Wait, but the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, pseudospheres have finite area, but perhaps this is a different kind of surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the metric given. Let me re-examine the metric: ds² = (32)/(4 -x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So when I converted to polar coordinates, r² =x² +y², so denominator is 4 - r².

Wait, but maybe this metric is for a hyperbolic space or something else. Wait, in 2D, the metric for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(a² (1 - r²/a²)^2 ), but that's a different form. Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric with a different curvature.

Wait, another approach: the Gaussian curvature K can be found from the metric. For a metric ds² = f(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 r)) (d/d r (r f(r)) ). Let me compute that.

f(r) = 32 / (4 - r²) = 32 (4 - r²)^{-1}.

So compute d/dr (r f(r)) = d/dr [ r * 32 (4 - r²)^{-1} } ]

Let me compute that: Let me let f(r)=32 (4 - r²)^{-1}, so r f(r) = 32 r (4 - r²)^{-1}.

The derivative is 32 [ (4 - r^2)^{-1} + r (-1) (4 - r^2)^{-2} (-2r) ) ]

Wait, applying the product rule: d/dr [32 r (4 - r²)^{-1}] = 32 [ (1) (4 - r²)^{-1} + r * (-1) * (-2r) (4 - r²)^{-2} ) ]

Simplify: 32 [ (1)/(4 - r²) + (2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Combine terms: Let's make denominator (4 - r²)^2.

So [ (4 - r²) + 2 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2 ) = (4 - r² + 2 r²) = (4 + r²) / (4 - r²)^2.

So the derivative is 32 (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

Wait, then K = - (1/(2 r)) * [32 (4 + r²)/(4 - r²)^2 ].

Wait, but K is the Gaussian curvature. So K = - [32 (4 + r²) ] / [ 2 r (4 - r²)^2 ]

But for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, K should be a negative constant. Let me see what this function K looks like.

Wait, but if K depends on r, then it's not a constant. So that suggests that this metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere, because K varies with r. Therefore, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and this isn't a pseudosphere. But the question states it's a pseudosphere of radius 2, so maybe I need to think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a different model. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach to finding the area: the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. So the integral over r is ∫0^2 (32 r/(4 - r²)) dr.

Which, as I computed before, becomes [32/(2)] ln(4 - r²) evaluated from 0 to 2.

Wait, no, I tried substitution earlier. Let me reevaluate that integral.

Wait, the integral ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute it as:

Integral of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr = -32 ∫ [ r / (r² -4) ] dr = -16 ∫ [ (2r)/(r² -4) ] dr.

The integral of (2r)/(r² -4) dr is ln| r² -4 | + C. So,

-16 [ ln(r² -4) ] evaluated from r=0 to 2.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, r² approaches 4, so r² -4 approaches 0. So ln(0) is -infinity. So

At r=2, ln(0) is -infinity. So the integral is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(-4) ]

Wait, but wait, when r is less than 2, r² -4 is negative, so the denominator is negative. So when r approaches 2 from below, r²-4 approaches zero from the negative side, so ln(r²-4) is ln(negative), which is not real. So perhaps this substitution isn't accounting for the absolute value correctly.

Hmm, perhaps I should take absolute value into account. So, let me redo the integral:

∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr = ∫ [ -32 r / (r² -4) ] dr.

Let u = r² -4, so du= 2r dr → (du/2) = r dr.

So ∫ [ -32 * (du/2) ] / u = ∫ (-16) (du/u) = -16 ln |u| + C = -16 ln |r² -4| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2: r²-4=0, so ln(0) is -infty. So,

Upper limit: -16 ln(0) → -16*(-infty) = +infty.

Lower limit (r=0): r² -4= -4, so |r²-4|=4. So ln(4). So,

-16 ln(4). So the integral from 0 to 2 is:

[+infty] - [ -16 ln(4) ] = +infty +16 ln4.

Which is still infinity. So the area is infinite.

So the area would be option D, +infty.

But wait, the question states it's a pseudosphere of radius 2. So why doesn't it have a finite area? Oh, because perhaps in this metric, the surface isn't a pseudosphere but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the radius r=2 is a coordinate thing, but the actual geometry is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. The area element is 32 r/(4 - r²) dr dθ. Integrating from r=0 to 2, and θ=0 to 2π.

So the area is ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

The θ integral is 2π, so the area is 2π * [ ∫0^2 (32 r/(4 - r²)) dr ].

Which, as we saw, is 2π times infinity, so the area is infinite.

So the correct answer would be D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2D metric, and it can be rewritten in polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), as:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

The area element in 2D is given by \(\sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta\), where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. For this metric, the determinant is:

\[
\det g = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over the domain of the metric. The metric is defined for \(4 - r^2 > 0\), which implies \(r < 2\). Therefore, \(r\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\), and \(\theta\) ranges from \(0\) to \(2\pi\). The total area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-16}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \(1/u\) is \(\ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) = -\infty\), the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). This means the area of the surface is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a "pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\)." However, the metric provided does not describe a pseudosphere, as the area diverges due to the singularity at \(r = 2\). The correct interpretation is that the area is infinite.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.
