Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I'm trying to figure out where the disappearing peaks would be. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that ChIP-seq is a method used to determine the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. So, in this case, they're using an antibody against the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. IKAROS is involved in the regulation of genes, especially in immune cells like B cells. So the main idea is that they crosslink the proteins to DNA, fragment the DNA, then use the antibody to pull down the protein-DNA complexes, and then sequence the DNA to find where the protein binds.

The question mentions that the sample was fixed using PFA (paraformaldehyde) alone and then another sample was fixed with PFA+DSG. DSG is dithiothreitol, which is a reducing agent. I think DSG is used in some fixation protocols to reduce disulfide bonds. Wait, but in the context of crosslinking, I remember that formaldehyde is the main crosslinker. PFA is a type of formaldehyde that's in paraformaldehyde form, often used for better solubility in aqueous solutions.

So, when you fix with PFA alone, you're crosslinking proteins to DNA. But why would adding DSG change things? I think in some protocols, especially for proteins that are harder to crosslink, they use DSG as a supplement. DSG can help in breaking disulfide bonds between proteins, allowing the crosslinkers (like formaldehyde) to better access the binding sites. So PFA+DSG might lead to a more efficient crosslinking.

Wait, but in this case, the ChIP peaks from PFA alone disappeared when using PFA+DSG. That suggests that with the addition of DSG, the binding sites detected by ChIP-seq are different. So why would that happen?

I recall that crosslinking efficiency can affect which regions are pulled down. Areas where crosslinking is less efficient might not show up as peaks when using a stronger crosslinking method. Alternatively, maybe there's something about the treatment that affects the accessibility of the DNA.

So, what regions are more sensitive to crosslinking conditions? I think that regions of open chromatin, like active promoters and enhancers, are easier to crosslink because the chromatin is more accessible. But wait
