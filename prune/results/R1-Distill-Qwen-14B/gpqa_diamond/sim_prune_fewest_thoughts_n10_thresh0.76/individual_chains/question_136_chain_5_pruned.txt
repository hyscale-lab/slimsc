Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on vector calculus, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, okay, so the vector field is radial and depends only on r. That might make things easier. The question is about ∇·f integrated over the volume of a sphere. I remember that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface, which is the sphere here.

But wait, do I need to compute the divergence first and then integrate, or can I use the divergence theorem directly? I think the divergence theorem says that the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. So maybe I can compute the flux through the sphere's surface instead, which might be simpler.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's first find the divergence of f. Since f is a radial vector field, it can be written as f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r), right? So, for f_r = 1/r², let's compute that.

So, f_r = 1/r². Let's compute the derivative of r² f_r with respect to r. r² * (1/r²) is just 1. So d/dr (1) is zero. Therefore, the divergence ∇·f is zero. That's interesting.

Wait, but wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, because at r=0, the field might not be defined. Oh, right! Because when r is zero, 1/r² is undefined. So actually, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But wait, in the volume integral, if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the volume, except possibly at a point, then
