Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH stretch or maybe an N-H. But in this case, since there's another peak at 1720 cm-1, that's probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches around 2500-3000 cm-1, right? So the IR here has a broad peak from 3400 to 2500, which might suggest an acidic -OH, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, the peak at 1720 is more characteristic of a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1. Hmm, but sometimes the exact position can vary. Wait, another peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1—those could be aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound has an aromatic ring, maybe a substituted benzene.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The protons are split into several signals. Let's parse each:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet, that's probably an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid. So that aligns with the IR data—so maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, each of the two protons adjacent to substituents would be a doublet. So perhaps the ring has two substituents in para positions. Wait, but in the case of benzoic acid, the ring would have a COOH group in one position and another group in the para position. So the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic Hs, which is what we have here.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – that's likely a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe an oxygen or something else. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps another CH2. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: the aromatic ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a COOH group, since we have the broad peak at 10.5 ppm. The other substituent is a group that's more complex. Let's think: the substituent on the ring would have a chain attached. The NMR shows a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), which is probably connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H) and then a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d, 3H). Oh wait, that's a branching point. Let's see: the structure might be something like a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent that's a branched alkyl group. 

Wait, the substituent could be an isobutyl group. Let me think: the ethyl group (from the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm) attached to a CH (at
