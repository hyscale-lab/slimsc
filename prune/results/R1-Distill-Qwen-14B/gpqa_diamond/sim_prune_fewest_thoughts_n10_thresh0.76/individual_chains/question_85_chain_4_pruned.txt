Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the setup: there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets have been detected via transit and radial velocity methods.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 has 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, Planet1 to Planet2.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Since the albedos are the same for both planets, that part cancels out.

The formula I recall is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ( (1/ (sqrt(1 + (m_planet/m_star)) )) )

Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Wait, another approach: The equilibrium temperature is given by the equation:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

But wait, that's when the star's temperature is T_star and radius R_star. But since the star's luminosity is also a factor, maybe I should think in terms of the star's luminosity.

Luminosity of the star, L, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πσ R_star^2 T_eff^4.

The planet's equilibrium temperature is determined by the energy balance: the power absorbed from the star equals the power radiated by the planet. So,

L * (R_planet / (2a))^2 * (1 - albedo) = 4π R_planet^2 σ T_eq^4.

Wait, no, let me get that right. The power received by the planet is the star's luminosity times the area of the planet (since the planet intercepts a cross-sectional area of π R_p^2) and then spreads that over its surface area. Alternatively, flux at distance a is L/(4πa²),
