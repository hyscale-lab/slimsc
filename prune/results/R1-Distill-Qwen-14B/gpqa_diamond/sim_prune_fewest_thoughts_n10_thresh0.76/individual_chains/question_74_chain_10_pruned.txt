Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is that we have a single atom, and we're monitoring it right away. We know from experiments that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. But wait, the key here is that the process is memoryless. Oh right, that's the exponential decay thing. The probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed; it only depends on the remaining time.

Wait, so the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay shouldn't change the probability for the next 150 minutes. Because each moment is independent. So the decay probability depends on the total time from now, not the previous time.

But wait, the given probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe I need to find the decay constant first. Let me think. The probability of decay in time t is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

Wait, the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32. So I can find λ using that.

So let's compute λ. P = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68), I think ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567. Wait, 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so ln(0.68) is about -0.3857 or something. Let me compute it more accurately. Let me think, ln(0.5) is -0.6931, ln(0.6
