Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The masses are negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that in systems of charges, the potential energy is involved when they interact with each other. Since all particles are identical and have the same charge, they will either all repel each other or attract, depending on the sign. Since each is 2e, I suppose they're all positive if e is positive (like protons), but the actual sign might not matter for the magnitude of energy.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. Oh, right, for a system of charges, the potential energy depends on their arrangement. To find the minimum energy, the charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But wait, since all the 12 are constrained at 2 meters from point P, where the 13th charge is fixed, I think their positions are fixed relative to P. So maybe I don't need to worry about their arrangement beyond their fixed positions. 

Wait, but the 12 charges are at 2 meters from P, but are they each at a different point? Like, forming a sphere around P? Or are they all at the same point? No, that can't be because they can't all be at the same point as they would repel each other. So they must be arranged in a way that each is 2 meters from P but spread out around it. So, perhaps, on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters, but the exact arrangement might not matter because each one is equidistant from P.

Wait, but when calculating the potential energy of the system, I think I need to consider the potential energy between each pair of charges. But since the 13th is fixed at P, each of the 12 charges at 2m contributes to the potential energy with the 1
