Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a Schrödinger cat state. I remember that a cat state is a superposition of coherent states, which are Gaussian states. So the state here is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). 

They want me to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, right? Coherent states are Gaussian, so a superposition of them is non-Gaussian. But how do I compute this relative entropy?

So the steps I think I need to take are:

1. Compute the density matrix rho for the given state.
2. Find the reference Gaussian state tau. I think tau would be the closest Gaussian state to rho in some sense, maybe the one that minimizes the relative entropy. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps for a cat state, the closest Gaussian state is a mixture of the two coherent states involved. Or maybe it's the completely mixed state, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: the relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). Wait, no, the formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. Oh wait, that's the same as S(rho) - S(tau), since S(rho) is Tr(rho ln rho), and similarly for tau. So nG would be the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is S(rho) - S(tau). But I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau, which would be the non-Gaussian part.

But wait, another point: for a Gaussian state, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is given by the purity. For a pure Gaussian state, S(rho)=0. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, a pure state has entropy zero. But wait, coherent states are pure. So a Gaussian pure state would have S=0. But a non-Gaussian pure state would have S>0. But wait, that can't be right because any pure state has S=0. Wait, no—wait, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) of a pure state is zero. Wait, so that's confusing. Because if rho is a pure state, then Tr(rho^2)=1, and S(rho)=0.

Wait, but that's not correct because I'm getting mixed up. No, no, for a pure state, rho is a projector, so rho^2= rho, thus Tr(rho^2)=1. The entropy S(rho) is -Tr(rho ln rho) which for a pure state is zero. So, if rho is a pure state, its entropy is zero. So how does this relate to the non-Gaussianity?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me look again: the problem states that the relative entropy measure is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. So it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau.

But wait, if rho is a pure state, then S(rho)=0. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau). But that would make del_b negative, but non-Gaussianity is a positive quantity, so maybe I have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau), which is the relative entropy. But the problem statement says del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau).

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Let me think about the problem. The state |psi> is a pure state because it's written as a vector, so rho is |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. Then del_b would be 0 - S(tau). But that would imply del_b is negative, but non-Gaussianity is supposed to be positive. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute S(tau) - S(rho), but since rho is pure, that would be S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is the entropy of the reference Gaussian state. I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state tau. So, perhaps del_b is S(rho||tau), which is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). So it's equal to S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the cross entropy. But in the problem statement, the formula is given as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So that would be [S(rho)] - [S(tau)].

But if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0. So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But this can't be right, because non-Gaussianity is a positive measure. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho), which would be S(tau) - S(rho). But S(rho) is zero, so del_b would be S(tau). But for a pure Gaussian state, S(tau) would be zero as well. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should find a different approach. Let's look at the problem again. The state is a Schrödinger cat state, which is non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian state tau is probably the closest Gaussian state to rho. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the mixture of the two coherent states in the superposition. Because the state is a sum of |alpha> and |-alpha>, each of which is a coherent state.

Wait, let me think. The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So the density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|, which would be a pure state. The reference Gaussian state tau is probably the closest Gaussian state to rho. Or, for a superposition state, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the completely mixed state, but that's probably not it.

Alternatively, consider that a Gaussian state is one that can be written as a Gaussian Wigner function. The density matrix of a Gaussian state can be expressed in terms of first and second moments. For a single mode, the Gaussian state can be written in terms of the mean (like alpha) and the covariance matrix. 

But for a pure Gaussian state, the density matrix is of the form rho_gauss = |alpha><alpha|, which is a coherent state. But the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it non-Gaussian.

Wait, but perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to the given state. So perhaps the reference state is a mixture of the two coherent states in the superposition. Let me think: perhaps tau is (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha|)/2, which is a classical mixture of the two coherent states. Because that's a Gaussian state.

If that's the case, then rho is the pure state |psi><psi|, and tau is the mixed state (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha|)/2.

So the non-Gaussianity would be the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau).

Wait, but rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. So S(rho||tau) = 0 - [Tr(rho ln tau)]. But wait, that can't be right because the relative entropy should be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is S(tau) - S(rho), which would be S(tau) - 0 = S(tau), but that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative entropy as S(rho) - S(tau), which would be 0 - S(tau), but that would be negative. Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau), which is the relative entropy between rho and tau. So in this case, rho is |psi><psi|, a pure state, and tau is a mixed Gaussian state.

So let's compute this. Since rho is pure, S(rho) = 0. So S(rho||tau) = 0 - Tr(rho ln tau).

Wait, but that would be negative. That doesn't make sense for a non-Gaussianity measure, which should be non-negative. So perhaps I've mixed up the order. Maybe the formula is S(tau||rho) = Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(tau ln rho). But since rho is pure, Tr(tau ln rho) would be problematic because rho is a projection, and ln rho is problematic unless rho is diagonal in that basis.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to compute the density matrices.

First, compute rho for the given state.

The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N.

N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)).

Wait, for phi = -pi/4, sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

Compute exp(-0.5): approximately 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So |psi> is ( cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.7071, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.7071.

So |psi> ≈ [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

So rho is |psi><psi|.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. For a superposition of two coherent states, the closest Gaussian state is the completely mixed state, because the state can't be written as a Gaussian. Wait, no, perhaps it's the state itself when expressed as a mixture. Alternatively, maybe the reference state is the state that would minimize the relative entropy between rho and tau, where tau is Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the state that is the closest Gaussian approximation to rho. For a two-mode state, I'm not sure, but perhaps in this case, it's the state with the same first and second moments as rho. But I'm not too certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the completely mixed state, which has maximum entropy. Let's see: the entropy of the completely mixed state (for a single mode) is S = log(d), where d is the dimension. But since we're in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, that's not helpful. So perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state tau is the state (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| )/2, as I thought earlier. This would be a classical mixture of the two coherent states, which is a Gaussian state (since it's a convex combination of coherent states, which are Gaussian). 

So, let me compute rho and tau.

rho is |psi><psi|, which for our state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)( cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha| ) / N^2.

Expanding this, we get:

rho = [ cos²(phi) |alpha><alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) |alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) | -alpha><alpha| + sin²(phi) |-alpha><-alpha| ] / N².

Now, tau is (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| )/2.

So tau is a mixed state with equal probabilities for the two coherent states.

Now, to compute the relative entropy del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau).

Wait, but rho is a pure state, so Tr(rho ln rho) = 0. So del_b would be 0 - [ Tr(tau ln tau) ].

Wait, but that would make del_b negative, which doesn't make sense because nG should be a positive quantity. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around: del_b = Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho) = Tr(tau ln tau) - 0 = Tr(tau ln tau).

But that would be the entropy of tau, which for the mixed state tau would be positive. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.

Wait, let's compute this. First, compute S(tau), the entropy of tau.

tau is (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| )/2. So the eigenvalues of tau are 0.5 and 0.5. Because it's a classical mixture of the two coherent states. So the eigenvalues are 0.5 for each of the two states.

Wait, but wait, the state tau is a mixed state. Its density matrix is diagonal in the basis of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Because |alpha> and |-alpha> are orthogonal? Wait, no, are they?

Wait, coherent states |alpha> and |beta> are orthogonal only if alpha and beta are zero. Wait, no, that's not correct. Coherent states are overcomplete and generally not orthogonal. Wait, let me check. The inner product <alpha|beta> = exp(-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2 + alpha* beta ). So for alpha = 0.5 and beta = -0.5, <alpha|beta> = exp( -0.25/2 -0.25/2 + (0.5*(-0.5)) ). Let's compute:

-0.25/2 is -0.125, so two of them sum to -0.25. Then, 0.5*(-0.5) = -0.25. So the exponent is (-0.25) + (-0.25) )= -0.5. So <alpha|beta> = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So they are not orthogonal. So the tau matrix isn't diagonal, which complicates things.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity measure using relative entropy between rho and tau is given by del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), but since rho is pure, S(rho) = 0, so del_b = - S(tau). But S(tau) is positive, so del_b would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between the given state and the closest Gaussian state. So it's S(rho||tau), which for a pure state rho and a mixed Gaussian state tau would be S(rho) - S(rho, tau) = 0 - [Tr(rho ln tau)]. But that would be negative, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different measure, like the logarithm of the square root of the probabilities or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is calculated differently.

Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of rho and tau. Since rho is a pure state, it has eigenvalues 1 and 0. But tau is a mixed state, so its eigenvalues depend on the structure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the non-Gaussianity ends up being zero. Looking at the options, option D is zero. But why would that be?

Wait, when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, let me compute N. Let me calculate sin(2phi): 2phi would be -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275. Which is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

So when I compute rho = |psi><psi|, it's a pure state, thus its density matrix has rank 1. So the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is zero.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau could be the state that maximizes the entropy given the constraints of being Gaussian. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state |psi> is a specific case where the non-Gaussianity becomes zero. But why would that be?

Wait, another thought: the problem involves a superposition of two coherent states. If the two coherent states are orthogonal, then their superposition would form a basis, and the density matrix would be a product state. But since they're not orthogonal, the state isn't a product and is non-Gaussian. But perhaps for certain phi and alpha, the state becomes Gaussian again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero if the state is Gaussian. But the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so option D (0) is unlikely, unless perhaps the state here is actually Gaussian.

Wait, when is the state |psi> Gaussian? A Gaussian state is one whose Wigner function is Gaussian, which includes coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. A superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian unless the two coherent states are identical, but in this case, they are |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are different.

Wait, but perhaps when N is 1, which happens when sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha^2) =0. Let me see when that is. For sin(2phi) =0, which occurs when phi is 0, pi/2, etc. So for phi=0, the state becomes |alpha>, a coherent state, which is Gaussian. So in that case, the non-Gaussianity would be zero, as the state is Gaussian.

But in this problem, phi is -pi/4, so sin(2phi) is -1. So the state is a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So option D is zero, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is Gaussian. So when phi is such that the state reduces to a coherent state, it's Gaussian. But in our case, it's a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So the answer can't be D.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in the relative entropy formula. Let's think again.

The problem says the relative entropy measure is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

So that's S(rho) - S(tau).

If rho is a pure state, S(rho) = 0. So del_b = - S(tau).

But S(tau) is positive, so del_b would be negative. That doesn't make sense because non-Gaussianity should be a positive quantity. So perhaps I have the formula wrong, and it's S(tau) - S(rho) = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). So del_b would be S(tau).

But then, what is S(tau)? tau is a Gaussian state, but is it pure or mixed?

If tau is the closest Gaussian state, perhaps for a Schrödinger cat state, the closest Gaussian state is a mixed state. For example, perhaps tau is the state (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| )/2, as I thought earlier.

In that case, the density matrix of tau would be:

tau = (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| )/2.

But the states |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal, as we computed earlier. So tau would not be diagonal in their basis.

The von Neumann entropy S(tau) is given by -Tr(tau ln tau). To compute this, I need to find the eigenvalues of tau.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by considering the general form.

Let’s suppose |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. Let their inner product be c = <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-alpha^2 - alpha^2 + alpha*(-alpha)) ) [Wait, I think I did that earlier. The inner product is exp( -|alpha|^2 - |beta|^2 + alpha * beta^* ). So for beta = -alpha, it becomes exp( -alpha² - alpha² + alpha*(-alpha) ), which is exp(-2 alpha² - alpha² )= exp(-3 alpha²)? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> have inner product <alpha| -alpha> = exp( -|alpha|²/2 - |-alpha|²/2 + alpha*(-alpha)* ) 

Wait, |alpha|² is alpha squared, and |-alpha| is same as |alpha|. So:

c = exp( - alpha² - alpha² + (-alpha^2) ) = exp( - alpha² - alpha² - alpha^2 ) = exp(-3 alpha^2).

Wait, is that correct? Let me compute:

The general formula for <alpha|beta> is exp( - (|alpha|² + |beta|²)/2 + alpha* beta ). 

So if beta = - alpha, then:

<alpha| - alpha> = exp( - (alpha² + alpha²)/2 + alpha*(- alpha) ) 
= exp( - (2 alpha²)/2 + (- alpha²) )
= exp( - alpha² - alpha² )
= exp( - 2 alpha² )

Ah, so I made a mistake earlier. The correct inner product is exp(-2 alpha²). For alpha = 0.5, that's exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So, now, the density matrix tau is (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| )/2. Let me write this as:

tau = (|a><a| + |b><b| )/2, where |a> = |alpha> and |b> = |-alpha>.

The eigenvalues of tau can be found by considering the projection onto the subspace spanned by |a> and |b>.

Let me construct a matrix in the basis {|a>, |b>}.

The matrix representation of tau in this basis is:

[ <a|a>  <a|b>  ]
[ <b|a>  <b|b>  ]
all multiplied by 1/2.

So each <c|d> is:

<a|a> = 1.

<a|b> = exp( -2 alpha² ), as we found earlier.

Similarly, <b|a> = same as <a|b>, since it's the complex conjugate. And <b|b> =1.

So the matrix becomes (1/2) * [
[1, e^{-2 alpha²} ],
[e^{-2 alpha²}, 1]
].

The eigenvalues are found by solving the equation det(tau - lambda I) = 0.

So:

(1/2)[ (1 - lambda)(1 - lambda) ) - (e^{-2 alpha²})^2 ] = 0.

Multiply both sides by 2:

(1 - lambda)^2 - e^{-4 alpha^2} = 0.

So (1 - lambda)^2 = e^{-4 alpha^2}.

Taking square roots:

1 - lambda = ± e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So lambda = 1 ± e^{-2 alpha^2}.

But wait, since the density matrix must have eigenvalues between 0 and 1, let's compute for alpha=0.5. e^{-1} ≈0.3679. So e^{-2 alpha²} = e^{-0.5} ≈0.6065. Wait, wait, no. Wait alpha is 0.5, so alpha² is 0.25. So 2 alpha² = 0.5. So e^{-2 * alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} ≈0.6065. So e^{-4 alpha^2} is e^{-1} ≈0.3679.

Wait, wait, in the equation above, (1 - lambda)^2 = e^{-4 alpha^2}.

So 1 - lambda = ± sqrt(e^{-4 alpha^2}) = ± e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So the eigenvalues are:

lambda_1 = 1 + e^{-2*alpha^2},
lambda_2 = 1 - e^{-2 alpha^2}.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 1 + e^{-2 alpha^2} would be greater than 1, which isn't allowed for a density matrix eigenvalue. So I must have made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me recast the equation correctly.

The matrix is:

[ (1/2)(1), (1/2)e^{-2 alpha²} ]
[ (1/2)e^{-2 alpha²}, (1/2)(1) ]

So the eigenvalues satisfy:

det( [ (1/2 - lambda), (1/2 e^{-2 alpha²}) ],
      [ (1/2 e^{-2 alpha²}), (1/2 - lambda) ] ) = 0.

Which gives:

(1/2 - lambda)^2 - (1/2 e^{-2 alpha^2})^2 = 0.

Expanding:

(1/4 - lambda + lambda²) - (1/4) e^{-4 alpha^2} = 0.

Wait, no. Wait, the determinant is (a - lambda)(d - lambda) - bc, so:

( (1/2 - lambda) )^2 - ( (1/2 e^{-2 alpha^2}) )^2 = 0.

Which is (1/2 - lambda)^2 = (1/2 e^{-2 alpha^2})^2.

Taking square roots:

1/2 - lambda = ± (1/2 e^{-2 alpha^2} )

So,

lambda = 1/2 ± (1/2 e^{-2 alpha^2})

So the eigenvalues are:

lambda_+ = (1 + e^{-2 alpha^2})/2,
lambda_- = (1 - e^{-2 alpha^2})/2.

Both are between 0 and 1, as required.

So, for alpha=0.5, e^{-2 alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} ≈0.6065.

So,

lambda_+ = (1 + 0.6065)/2 ≈ 0.80325,
lambda_- = (1 - 0.6065)/2 ≈0.19675.

So the eigenvalues of tau are approximately 0.80325 and 0.19675.

The entropy S(tau) is - sum lambda_i ln lambda_i.

Compute each term:

For lambda_+ ≈0.80325:

-0.80325 * ln(0.80325) ≈0.80325 * 0.2197 ≈0.1765.

For lambda_- ≈0.19675:

-0.19675 * ln(0.19675) ≈0.19675 * 1.645 ≈0.3235.

Adding them together: 0.1765 + 0.3235 ≈0.5.

So S(tau) ≈0.5 nats.

But wait, I thought the formula was del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0.5 = -0.5. But non-Gaussianity can't be negative. So perhaps I have the formula wrong, and it's S(tau) - S(rho) = 0.5 - 0 = 0.5.

But in the problem statement, the formula was del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0.5 = -0.5.

But that's negative. So perhaps the correct measure is S(tau) - S(rho) which is positive, 0.5.

But the options given are 2.48, 0.25, 1.38, 0. So 0.5 isn't an option. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the entropy. Let me recheck the calculation.

Compute each term:

For lambda_+ = (1 + e^{-1})/2 when alpha=0.5, so 2 alpha^2=0.5. So e^{-0.5} is correct.

Wait, but no, earlier I took alpha as 0.5, so 2 alpha^2 is 0.5. So e^{-0.5} is correct.

So,

lambda_+ = (1 + e^{-0.5})/2 ≈ (1 + 0.6065)/2 ≈ 0.80325.

lambda_- = (1 - 0.6065)/2 ≈0.19675.

So,

- lambda_+ ln lambda_+ = - 0.80325 * ln(0.80325).

What's ln(0.80325)? Let me compute.

ln(0.8) ≈-0.2231, 0.8 is about 0.8. So 0.80325 is a bit higher. Let me compute it more accurately.

ln(0.80325) ≈-0.2197.

So,

-0.80325 * (-0.2197) ≈0.80325 * 0.2197 ≈0.1766.

Similarly for lambda_-:

ln(0.19675) is about ln(0.2) ≈-1.6094. 0.19675 is close to 0.2, so let's say ln(0.19675)= -1.645.

So,

-0.19675 * (-1.645) ≈0.19675 *1.645 ≈0.3235.

Adding together: 0.1766 + 0.3235 ≈0.5001, which is about 0.5 nats.

So S(tau) ≈0.5.

But according to the formula given in the problem, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0.5 = -0.5.

But the problem states that nG is calculated using this formula, so the value would be -0.5. But non-Gaussianity can't be negative. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). Then, for our case, del_b = 0.5 - 0 = 0.5, which is a positive value. But looking back at the options, option C is 1.38, B is 0.25, etc. So 0.5 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy in a different way. Another possibility is that the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed state, but for an infinite-dimensional system, that's not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is not the mixture of the two coherent states but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is given by the logarithm of the square root of the probabilities, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state, which would involve optimizing over all Gaussian states tau. But that's a more involved calculation, perhaps beyond the scope of this problem.

Another idea: perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the given state is a squeezed vacuum state, which is Gaussian. Wait, no, a squeezed state is Gaussian, but a cat state is not.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the state |psi> is a coherent state, which happens when phi=0. So when phi is zero, N becomes sqrt(1 + 0) =1. So the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity would be zero. But in our case, phi is -pi/4, so the state is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity shouldn't be zero, which rules out option D.

Wait, but perhaps the given state is a coherent state in some other basis. For example, for certain phi and alpha, the state could be a product of coherent states, making it Gaussian. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the state can be rewritten as a coherent state. Let me see:

|psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

Can this be written as a coherent state |beta> for some beta?

A coherent state is |beta> = e^{-|beta|^2/2} sum (beta^n / sqrt(n!)} |n>.

But a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> would generally not form another coherent state unless the coefficients are arranged in a specific way. For example, if phi is chosen such that cos(phi) and sin(phi) are arranged to produce a specific amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is written as a sum of two coherent states, it can be expressed as another coherent state under certain conditions. Let me try to see.

|psi> = [ cos(phi) |alpha> + i sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N.

Wait, maybe I can factor this as a sum. Let me think: perhaps using Euler's formula, cos(phi)= Re(e^{i phi}), and sin(phi)=Im(e^{i phi}).

But in this case, the coefficients are real. So perhaps it's better to think in terms of phase factors.

Alternatively, perhaps |psi> can be written as |beta> where beta is a combination of alpha and -alpha.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to compute.

Assume |psi> is a coherent state |beta>.

So,

|beta> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

But for this to be a coherent state, we must have:

beta = [ cos(phi) alpha + sin(phi) (-alpha) ] / N.

Wait, because a coherent state is a linear combination of number states weighted by beta^n, but perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> can be written as a displaced thermal state or something else Gaussian, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the state |psi> is a cat state, the non-Gaussianity is non-zero, but for certain parameters, it could be zero. But I'm not sure when that would happen.

Wait, maybe I should compute the density matrix for |psi> and then compare it to the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

But this seems complicated, especially considering the time I have. Let's think: the options are A) 2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

Earlier, I thought that the non-Gaussianity would be around 0.5, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the purity of the state, but that's not directly the same as non-Gaussianity.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is computed as the logarithm of the inverse of the fidelity between rho and tau. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem involves the logarithm of the inverse of the overlap between rho and tau. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, the state is actually Gaussian. But earlier, I thought that was not the case.

Wait, perhaps the state becomes Gaussian when the phase phi is such that the terms cancel out. Let me check.

Wait, when phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2 and sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2. So, the state is (sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ) / N.

If N is such that this simplifies into a coherent state, then the state would be Gaussian. But I don't think that's possible because it's a superposition of two different coherent states.

Hmm. Another thought: perhaps when the state |psi> is written in a certain way, it's actually a product state, making it Gaussian. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is a product state, but I think that's not directly applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually a coherent state. Let me check.

If |psi> is a coherent state, then it must satisfy the relation:

|beta> = e^{-|beta|^2/2} sum (beta^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>.

But our |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which doesn't seem to fit that form unless beta is zero, which would make it a vacuum state. So I don't think that's the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options given are A) 2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

Earlier, I calculated S(tau) as approximately 0.5. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative entropy correctly. Let me think again.

The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau).

But since rho is a pure state, Tr(rho ln rho) = 0. So S(rho||tau) = - Tr(rho ln tau).

But how do I compute Tr(rho ln tau)?

Wait, rho is |psi><psi|, so Tr(rho ln tau) = < psi | ln tau | psi >.

But tau is the reference Gaussian state, which we thought was (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| )/2.

Wait, but perhaps tau is a different Gaussian state, such as the completely mixed state, which for a single mode would have maximum entropy. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state tau is the state that minimizes the relative entropy S(rho||tau) over all Gaussian states tau. But finding that tau is non-trivial.

But perhaps in the case where the state |psi> is a coherent state, tau would be the same as rho, making del_b=0.

But in our case, |psi> is a non-Gaussian state, so del_b should be positive.

But without knowing the correct formula, perhaps the answer is option C)1.38.

Wait, but how? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is 1.38. How?

If S(rho) is 0, and S(tau) is about 0.5, then del_b would be 0 - 0.5 = -0.5, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the formula is S(tau) - S(rho) = 0.5, which is positive.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is multiplied by 2. So 0.5 * 2 = 1.0. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation involves the natural logarithm (nats), and the options are in bits. So 0.5 nats is approximately 0.5 * 0.693 ≈0.346 bits, which is still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative entropy between the mixed state and the pure state. Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is the relative entropy between tau and rho, which would be S(tau||rho). But since rho is pure, ln(rho) is ln(|psi><psi|) which is problematic as |psi><psi| is a rank-1 matrix, and ln of a rank-1 matrix isn't straightforward.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the given options. The only option that makes sense for a non-Gaussian state is C)1.38 or A)2.48. But without more information, it's hard to choose.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is calculated as the logarithm of the inverse of the probability. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the state |psi> is a coherent state, the non-Gaussianity is zero. But for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, it's not a coherent state, so the non-Gaussianity isn't zero. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is a product state. But in this case, it's a pure state, which is a product in the sense of a single mode, so that's always the case. But I'm not sure.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the options, I think the correct answer is C)1.38, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D)0, but that doesn't seem right.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} \), and the relative entropy is defined as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Properties**: The given state is a superposition of two coherent states, \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\), which makes it non-Gaussian. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is generally non-Gaussian unless specific conditions are met.

2. **Normalization Constant**: For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), the normalization constant \(N\) is computed as:
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}} = \sqrt{1 - e^{-0.5}} \approx \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

3. **Density Matrix of \(\rho\)**: The density matrix \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\) is a pure state, so its von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\).

4. **Reference Gaussian State \(\tau\)**: The reference Gaussian state is assumed to be the classical mixture of the two coherent states:
   \[
   \tau = \frac{|\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha| + |-\alpha\rangle\langle-\alpha|}{2}.
   \]
   This is a mixed state with eigenvalues:
   \[
   \lambda_\pm = \frac{1 \pm e^{-2\alpha^2}}{2}.
   \]
   For \(\alpha = 0.5\), \(e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065\), giving:
   \[
   \lambda_+ \approx 0.80325, \quad \lambda_- \approx 0.19675.
   \]

5. **Entropy of \(\tau\)**: The von Neumann entropy of \(\tau\) is:
   \[
   S(\tau) = -\lambda_+ \ln \lambda_+ - \lambda_- \ln \lambda_-.
   \]
   Substituting the eigenvalues:
   \[
   S(\tau) \approx -0.80325 \ln(0.80325) - 0.19675 \ln(0.19675).
   \]
   Using approximations for the logarithms:
   \[
   S(\tau) \approx 0.5 \, \text{nats}.
   \]

6. **Relative Entropy Calculation**: The relative entropy is given by:
   \[
   \Delta_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau) = 0 - S(\tau) = -0.5.
   \]
   However, non-Gaussianity is a positive quantity, so the formula is likely interpreted as:
   \[
   \Delta_b = S(\tau) - S(\rho) = 0.5 - 0 = 0.5.
   \]

7. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated value of \(0.5\) does not match any of the provided options. This suggests a possible error in the interpretation of the formula or the reference Gaussian state. Given the options, the most plausible answer is **C) 1.38**, which could account for additional factors or approximations not explicitly stated in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The non-Gaussianity is expected to be a positive value, and based on the reasoning and the provided options, the most reasonable choice is:
