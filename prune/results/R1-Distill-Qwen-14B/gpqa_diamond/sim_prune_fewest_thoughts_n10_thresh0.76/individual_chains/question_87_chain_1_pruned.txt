Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, first, let me break down the information. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means it has two substituents attached to the benzene ring. Also, the total carbon atoms are 8. Since benzene has 6 carbons, the substituents must add 2 more carbons. So each substituent must contribute one carbon each, but wait, wait. Or maybe one substituent is a group with more than one carbon. Let me think.

Wait, di-substituted benzene has two groups attached. So 6 (benzene) + substituent carbons = 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent is probably a single carbon group. But wait, that's not possible for some groups. Let me think about possible groups.

The IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (Ar-X). So the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Wait, but di-substituted means two substituents. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but a carbonyl group in an aromatic ring would be like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something. Let's think. If the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen, then the structure would be an aromatic ring with a -X (like Cl, Br) and a carbonyl group attached.

Wait, another possibility: maybe one of the substituents is a carbonyl-containing group, such as an acyl group. For example, if the substituent is an aldehyde (-CHO), that's a carbonyl and contributes one carbon. Then another substituent is halogen (like Cl), which is one carbon? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Halogen is just an atom, like Cl attached directly to the ring, so it doesn
