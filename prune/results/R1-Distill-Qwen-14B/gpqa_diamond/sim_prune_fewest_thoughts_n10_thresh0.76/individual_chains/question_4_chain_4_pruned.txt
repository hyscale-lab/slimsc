Okay, I need to figure out which Maxwell's equations would change if in a parallel universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, right. In our universe, I remember that magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't isolate them. But wait, why is that? Oh, right, because of the properties in Maxwell's equations.

Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me recall them. The first one is Gauss's law for electric fields, which relates the divergence of E to charge density. The second is Gauss's law for magnetism, which says the divergence of B is zero, implying no isolated magnetic charges. The third is Faraday's law of induction, involving the curl of E and the time derivative of B. The fourth is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, about the curl of H and the current plus displacement current.

So if in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would mean magnetic monopoles exist. So the magnetic version of Gauss's law would change. In our world, div B = 0. If monopoles exist, div B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how div E is proportional to electric charge density. So the second equation changes.

Wait, but what about the other equations? Faraday's law (third equation) involves the curl of E. In our case, it's curl E = -∂B/∂t. I don't think a magnetic monopole would affect this equation directly. Unless... Wait, no, Faraday's law is about induced electric fields by changing magnetic fields. If you have monopoles, maybe the B field behaves differently, but I'm not sure if that equation changes. Alternatively, perhaps the fourth equation, Ampère's, involves the curl of H and J plus ∂D/∂t. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect Ampère's law? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, another thought. If there are magnetic charges, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. So the second equation (Gauss's law for magnetism) would change. But what about the other equations? Let me think about symmetry. Electric charges have both divergence and curl considerations. Similarly for magnetic charges, perhaps the equations for B and E would mirror each other.

In our case, E has divergence proportional to rho, and curl proportional to the time derivative of B. For B, in our case, divergence is zero, and curl is proportional to J plus displacement current. If there are magnetic monopoles, perhaps the curl of B would involve the time derivative of E? Or wait, maybe the curl of E would change? Hmm, no, because Faraday's law is about the time change of B, not E.

Wait, actually, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The four Maxwell equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Electric charge)
2. ∇·B = 0 (No magnetic monopoles)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's Law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) (Ampère's Law)

If magnetic monopoles exist, equation 2 would change to ∇·B = μ₀
