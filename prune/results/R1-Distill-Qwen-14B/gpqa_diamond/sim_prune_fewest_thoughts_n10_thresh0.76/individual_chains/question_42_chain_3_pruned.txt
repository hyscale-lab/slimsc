Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Okay, the question is about determining the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. Hmm. They've given me some ratios of equilibrium temperatures, masses, and the albedo is the same for all. 

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. The formula I think is T = (L/(16πσd²))^½, where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance. But wait, in this problem, the star's luminosity might be the same for all three planets since they're orbiting the same star. So the equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the distance from the star. 

Wait, but actually wait. The equilibrium temperature formula, considering albedo, is T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσd²)]^(1/4). But since the albedo a is the same for all three planets (given as 0.3), it cancels out when taking ratios. So the ratio of temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse ratio of distances. 

So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (T1/T2) is sqrt(d2/d1). Or wait, no, wait. Let's think again. T is proportional to (L/(d^2))^½. So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). So if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, and T2 of Planet2, then T1/T2 = (d2/d1)^(½), because T1 is inversely proportional to d1, and T2 to d2. So, T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me see: T ~ 1/sqrt(d). So, T1 = k / sqrt(d1), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(d2)/sqrt(d1) )= sqrt(d2/d1). Right, so the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(d2/d1). 

Wait the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4
