Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That makes them chiral. So I need to figure out which of the given compounds are chiral, meaning they can have optical isomers.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures are interesting. Let me visualize this. It's a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond) with substituents. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' for the dicarboxylate groups and at 6 and 6' for the nitro groups. Wait, so on each ring, substituents are at 2, 2', 6, 6'. Now, the key is whether this structure has a plane of symmetry. For biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that prevent the molecule from being superimposable on its mirror image, it could have optical isomers.

Wait, in this case, are the substituents arranged symmetrically? Let's think: the two rings each have a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. But wait, in a biphenyl, positions 2 and 6 are across from each other when the rings are connected in a certain way. Wait, maybe I should draw it. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So for each ring, the substituents are on opposite sides. Now, for the entire molecule, could it have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged such that their positions mirror each other, making the molecule achiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement leads to no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Wait, considering the structure, if the two rings are connected by a single bond, they can rotate. But in this case, with substituents at 2 and 2' on each ring, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides?

Wait, the substituents are at 6 and 6' positions, which are on each ring. Let me think about the structure. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions are symmetrical across the central bond, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. But if the arrangement is such that the substituents are in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents create a center of chirality. Wait, but biphenyls usually can exhibit geometric isomerism if the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides of the central bond. But optical isomerism is about chirality, which requires a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The formula is CH3COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, maybe. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH2COO-OCH3, but the substituents would be on the second carbon.

Wait, the compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is CH2C(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure would be CH3-CHOH-COOOCH3. Wait, that's not correct. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as the acid, so the ester is (CH2CH2COO-)OCH3. But the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate group. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no: wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the structure is more precisely CH2(OH)-CH2-CO-OCH3. Is that correct? So the molecule is: the central carbon (second carbon) has a hydroxyl, two methyl groups (from CH2) and a carbonyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, no: the ester group is OCH3. So the carbonyl is connected to OCH3 and to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

The molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CHOH-CH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon, which is connected to CH2 and another CH3 (propanoate is CH2CH2COO-). Hmm.

Wait, in any case, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center. Let's look for a carbon with four different substituents.

In the structure, the central carbon (the one attached to hydroxyl) has:

- One hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Two CH2 groups (one leading to the carbonyl, another leading to the methyl ester)
Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-COOCH3?

No, wait, wait. If it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So each carbon:

- The carbonyl is at the end, so the adjacent carbon (second carbon) is CH2 connected to the carbonyl and to the hydroxyl and another CH2, which is connected to CH3?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the molecule as:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as the acid. So the ester is CH2CH2COO-OCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon of the three. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3.

So the second carbon (the middle one) has:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (one to the left, which is CH2, and right, which is CH2COO-OCH3)
Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

The central carbon is the second carbon, which has:

- OH attached
- One CH2 group (to the left)
- One COOCH3 group attached (to the right)
- And a methyl group? Or perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- And a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester is OCH2CH2COO-OCH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the substituents on the central carbon.

If the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, then the central carbon (second carbon) has:

- OH
- CH2 (to the left, which is connected to another CH2)
- COOCH3 (to the right)
- And a hydrogen?

Wait, but in that case, the central carbon would have:

- OH
- CH2CH2COOCH3
- CH3 (from the other side)
Wait, no, perhaps that's not accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the second carbon in the chain attached to the hydroxyl, a CH group between the two CH2 groups. So the substituents on the second carbon would be:

- OH
- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, I'm getting tangled. Let me think differently. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate has three carbons. The 2-hydroxy is on the second carbon.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CHOH-CH3

Wait, but that would make the second carbon (the one with the OH) attached to:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (left and right)
- And the carbonyl group.

Wait, but that would mean it's attached to two CH2 groups (same group), a carbonyl, and a hydrogen. So perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (on one side)
- CH3 (on the other)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the one in the middle) has:

- OH
- CH3 (from the left)
- CH2COOCH3 (on the right)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, so the four substituents are: OH, CH3, CH2COOCH3, and H. Are any two substituents the same? Well, CH3 is a methyl group, H is a hydrogen, OH is hydroxyl, and CH2COOCH3 is a propionyl group (or something like that). So all four substituents are different. Therefore, the central carbon is a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So point 2 is a yes.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (PhCO)Ph, meaning two benzene rings connected by a ketone group. The structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the double bond). Wait, no, the carbonyl group is O=C-O. No, wait, benzophenone is (C6H5)2CO. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the middle carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two phenyl groups. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the double bond). Wait, no, the carbonyl is C=O, so the carbon has a double bond to O, and single bonds to two phenyl groups. So that's:

- Two phenyl groups (same substituent)
- One double bond to O (so that's a double bond, which counts as a substituent)
- And a single bond to another O (but wait, the carbonyl is O=C, so the arrangement is O=C-O, no, wait no. Benzophenone is Ar–C(=O)–Ar. So the carbonyl carbon is attached to two aryl groups (Ph) and double bonded to O. So the substituents are: two Ph, one O (double bond), and one H? No, wait, in benzophenone, the carbonyl carbon is not bonded to H. So, substituents are two phenyl groups, one O (double bond), and one H? Wait, no, wait. Benzophenone structure:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

The carbonyl carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, has a double bond to O, and that's it. So the substituents are two phenyl groups, a double bond to O, and that's it. Wait, but that's only three substituents. Wait, but the carbon in the ketone group has four bonds. So it's double bonded to O, and single bonded to two phenyl groups and another single bond to what? Wait, no, in benzophenone, the carbonyl is C=O, so the carbon has one double bond (to O) and two single bonds to each phenyl group. So that's three bonds. Wait, but carbon needs four bonds. Oh wait, the carbonyl is C=O, which is a double bond, so the carbon has three substituents: two phenyls and the double bond. Wait, but that would only be three, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, no. Benzophenone's structure is (Ar)₂CO. So the carbonyl carbon has a double bond to one O, and single bonds to two Ar groups. So that's three bonds. But carbon has four bonds, so where's the fourth? Oh wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe the carbonyl is C=O, so the carbon has a triple bond? No, wait, no. Let me think: in ketones, the carbonyl is a double bond. So the structure is O=C–R. So in benzophenone, it's O=C–Ph–Ph? No, wait, no. No, benzophenone has two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a double bond O. But that's three substituents. Wait, that can't be right because carbon can't have only three bonds. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recount: in a ketone, the structure is R₂C=O. So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two R groups and an O with a double bond. So for benzophenone, each R is a phenyl group. So the structure is Ph₂C=O. But then where's the fourth bond? Oh, wait, no. The carbonyl has a double bond to O, so the carbon has three substituents in addition to the double bond. Wait, that makes sense. So the carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O and two single bonds to each phenyl group. So that's three substituents and a double bond. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are:

- Phenyl (from one side)
- Phenyl (from the other)
- Double bond O.

Wait, but that's three substituents and a double bond. So it's sp² hybridized. So the carbonyl carbon is trigonal planar, not tetrahedral. So it can't be a chiral center because chiral centers are tetrahedral. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. So point 3 is a no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the ester form. Structure-wise, fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid. Its dimethyl ester would be the diester.

So, dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on each end. The structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So it's CH₂–CH–(COOCH3)₂, but the double bond is between the first and second carbons.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is (Z), fumaric is (E). So maleic acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, no. Wait, but I think fumaric acid is HO₂C–CH₂–CH₂–CO₂H? No, wait, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, maleic acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, maleic acid is HO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂H, but in the cis configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans version. So the structure is:

HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: maleic acid is cis-butenedioic acid, and fumaric is trans.

So the structure of maleic acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? Wait, no, that's butane diol. No, butenedioic acid would have a double bond. So, maleic acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, no, wait. Maleic acid is HOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COOH? No, no, wait. Wait, no. Maleic acid is HOOC–CH=CH–COOH, but with the two COOH groups on the same side of the double bond. And fumaric acid is the same but with the COOH groups on opposite sides.

So the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, with the substituents (COOCH3) on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure would have a double bond between C1 and C2, with each of those carbons attached to two COOCH3 groups, but arranged in a trans configuration.

Now, does this structure have any stereoisomerism? Well, in fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, which gives it geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but in the case of the dimethyl ester, it's already trans, so perhaps it's a single diastereomer. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, not geometric.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry causing it to lack a plane of symmetry.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the central carbons (the ones attached to the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3 groups. Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides.

Wait, the structure is:

CH₂–CH₂

But with double bond and ester groups.

Wait, no, more accurately, dimethyl fumarate is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, so each of the two carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each of those carbons is attached to two identical groups (two COOCH3).

Wait, so each of those carbons is CH₂–. No, wait, each has a double bond, so each carbon is CH–.

So the structure would be:

      O
      ||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O-C-OCH3
      O

No, wait, that's not right. Let's think again.

The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

O=C-OCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
|     |
O=C-OCH3

No, but that's more like a single bond. No, actually, the structure is:

The two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂–CH–
      |
      O
      ||
      O-C-OCH3

Wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
     |
     COOCH3

But with a double bond between the two CHs. So the correct structure is:

CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, but each of the two CH groups (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two COOCH3 groups. So each of those CH groups has two COOCH3 substituents and a double bond. So for each CH, the substituents are:

- COOCH3 (two of them)
- Double bond to the other CH.

So each CH is connected to two identical substituents and the double bond. So, each of those carbons has two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and the double bond.

Wait, no, in the structure, each double-bonded carbon is connected to two COOCH3 and two CH2 groups?

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck again. Let me think: in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
|     |
O-C-OCH3
      O
      ||
      O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that seems off. Let me think differently. Fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid. When esterified with methanol, both -COOH groups become -COOCH3. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
     |
     COOCH3

But this would be if the substituents are on the same side. Wait, no, fumarate is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
     |
     COOCH3

But with a double bond, making it CH₂=CH. So the correct structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH₂–CH₂
     |
     COOCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no. Let me think of it as CH₂=CH with both CH₂ groups substituted with COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH₂(COOCH3)–CH₂(COOCH3)

But with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but in the trans configuration.

Each of the two CH groups (in the double bond) has two COOCH3 groups attached. So each CH is connected to two COOCH3, a double bond, and a hydrogen.

Wait, that can't be right. Each CH would have two COOCH3, a double bond, and a hydrogen, making four substituents. So each CH in the double bond has four substituents: two COOCH3, one hydrogen, and the double bond (to the other carbon). So each of those carbons has four different groups? No, because two substituents are the same (COOCH3). So each of those carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and a double bond. So the substituents are:

- Two COOCH3 (same)
- H
- Double bond (which is a substituent, but it's a bond, not a group)

Wait, but for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So if a carbon has two COOCH3 groups, then two substituents are the same, so it can't be chiral. Therefore, each of the carbons in the double bond doesn't have four different substituents, so they aren't chiral centers.

But wait, could the molecule have a center of symmetry or some other form of asymmetry leading to optical isomerism? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule as a whole is chiral.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. But in terms of optical isomerism, only compounds with chiral centers can exhibit that. Since dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait a second. Fumaric acid is a trans-dioic acid. In its ester form, the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, giving the molecule a certain symmetry.

Wait, but the molecule itself: if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For instance, if you imagine the double bond as the central axis, and the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule might be symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: sometimes, even if a molecule doesn't have a chiral center, it can be chiral due to a lack of a plane of symmetry. For example, allenes can be chiral without any chiral centers. But in dimethyl fumarate's case, the structure is such that it's symmetrical. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Fumarate is the trans isomer, which has a plane of symmetry. So dimethyl fumarate would also have that plane, making it achiral. So it wouldn't have optical isomerism. Therefore, point 4 is a no.

Wait, but wait another thing. Some sources say that fumarate can exist as a pair of enantiomers, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is actually in a configuration that allows for chirality.

Wait, no, because each of the carbons in the double bond has two identical substituents (two COOCH3 groups). So they can't be chiral centers. So the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism. So point 4 is a no.

Wait, but wait, another angle: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, dimethyl fumarate's structure is symmetrical around the double bond, so it's not chiral. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to visualize. If the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule would have a center of symmetry perhaps, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check what I know about fumarate. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Maleate has two ester groups on the same side, so it's a cis diastereomer. Fumarate is trans. But since fumarate is symmetrical, perhaps it's not chiral.

Wait, another way: if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. So for dimethyl fumarate, if it has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. Let me imagine the structure: the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So if I draw the molecule, the substituents are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical along the plane that bisects the double bond. Therefore, it's achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So from this, points 1, 2, 3, 4 are: 1- yes, 2- yes, 3- no, 4- no.

Wait, but that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, let me go back to the first compound.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So the structure is biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 2' for the dicarboxylate groups and at 6 and 6' for the nitro groups.

Wait, if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, and the other ring has substituents at 2' and 6', then the structure would have substituents at 2,6 on each ring.

Wait, but 6 is opposite to 2 on the benzene ring. So substituents at 2 and 6 are across from each other on each ring.

So the molecule is a biphenyl where each ring has two substituents at opposite positions, and the other two substituents on the other ring are also in opposite positions.

Now, considering the arrangement, could the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the two rings are connected in such a way that the substituents mirror each other, then the molecule could be symmetrical. But if not, it could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are symmetrically placed, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para positions. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, which are across from each other.

Now, in the biphenyl system, if each substituent is at the para position relative to the connecting bond, then the substituents on each ring are symmetric with respect to the central bond. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's not correct, because substituents being para doesn't necessarily mean the molecule is symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, making the molecule achiral.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of biphenyl as having two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are across from each other. So each substituent on one ring is opposite to the connecting point. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other.

So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6—so that's para to each other. So the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical. But since both rings have the same substituent arrangement, the entire molecule might be symmetric across the central bond. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral. So point 1 is a no.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure allows for the substituents to be arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on the same side of the central bond, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether this compound has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged such that each ring's substituents are mirrored, then the molecule is symmetrical. Otherwise, it's chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So in the first ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. Similarly, on the second ring, substituents are at 2' and 6', which are opposite each other. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond between the two rings. Therefore, it's symmetrical and not chiral.

Ah, so point 1 is a no.

So, putting it all together:

1. No optical isomerism (achiral)
2. Yes (chiral center)
3. No (not chiral)
4. No (not chiral)

Wait, but earlier I thought point 4 might be a no, but I also thought perhaps it's a yes. Let me recheck.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate's structure is (CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂) with the substituents on opposite sides. Now, in this structure, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a hydrogen. So each of these carbons has two same substituents (COOCH3), a double bond, and a hydrogen. So that's four substituents, but two are the same. Therefore, each carbon isn't a chiral center. So the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and hence isn't chiral. So point 4 is a no.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a center of chirality elsewhere, but I can't think of any. So, no.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate). But looking back at the options, the options are combinations. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → includes 4, which I think is no, so A is incorrect.
B) 3 and 4 → both no, so B is incorrect.
C) 2 and 3 → 3 is no, so C incorrect.
D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no, 2 is yes → D is incorrect.

Wait, so none of the options match the conclusion that only 2 is correct. But looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating point 4.

Wait, another angle: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but not a chiral molecule. So it doesn't have optical isomers.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because some sources say fumarate is a meso compound. Let me think: a meso compound has multiple stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, are there any stereocenters?

No, because the two carbons in the double bond each have two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and a double bond. So no chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral. So point 4 is a no.

Then, only point 2 is a yes. But looking at the options, the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → includes 4 which I believe is no.
B) 3 and 4 → both no.
C) 2 and 3 → 3 is no.
D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating point 1.

Wait, perhaps the first compound does have optical isomerism. Let me reevaluate point 1.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure: each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So the substituents on each ring are para to each other.

Now, looking at the entire molecule, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, but the other ring has substituents at 2' and 6' — which are also across. So the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical.

But the biphenyl's central bond allows for rotation. So perhaps the molecule can have different conformations, but that doesn't affect the symmetry.

Wait, but for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have no center of inversion. So in this case, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

Wait, another approach: can the molecule be superimposed on its mirror image? If not, it's chiral.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it's chiral. For example, if the substituents are on the same side of the central bond, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a case of biphenyl with substituents that lead to a chiral arrangement.

Wait, for biphenyls to exhibit optical isomerism, the substituents must be arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So in this case, if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other, then the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical. But when considering both rings, the arrangement could be such that the molecule as a whole is symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as having a certain arrangement. If the substituents on both rings are arranged in a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical, then it's achiral. Otherwise, it's chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para. So, for each ring, the substituent arrangement is symmetrical. If the two rings have substituents that mirror each other, the entire molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on the two rings are arranged such that they don't mirror each other, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6'. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para. So the substituents are arranged in a symmetrical fashion on each ring. Therefore, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So point 1 is a no.

So, only point 2 is a yes. But in the options, I don't see an option that includes only 2. Wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4 → yes, 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are no.
B) 3,4 → no.
C) 2,3 → no.
D) 1,2 → no.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is not a chiral compound. Did I make a mistake in evaluating point 2?

Let me reevaluate point 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: the ester is CH3O-CO-O-CH2CH2OH?

Wait, no, wait, no. The correct structure would be: the ester group is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the propanoate. Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- CH3 (from the other CH2 group)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is propanoate, which is three carbons.

The correct structure is:

CH2(OH)–CH2–COOCH3.

So the carbons are:

1: CH2(OH)
2: CH2–
3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that's not the case. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, no, the correct structure for 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate is CH₂CH₂COO⁻, with the hydroxyl on the second carbon.

So the structure would be:

CH₂(OH)–CH2–COOCH3.

So the second carbon (middle one) has:

- OH
- CH2– (connected to the first carbon, which is CH2OH)
- CH2– (connected to the third carbon, which is COOCH3)
- And a hydrogen.

So the substituents on the second carbon are:

- OH
- CH2OH (the first carbon)
- CH2COOCH3 (the third carbon)
- H.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the first carbon is CH2OH, so the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3
- And H.

Wait, but that would make four substituents, but two of them are CH2 groups. Are any of them the same?

Wait, the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2OH (from the left)
- CH2COOCH3 (from the right)
- H.

Wait, so the substituents are all different. So the second carbon has four different groups attached, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So point 2 is a yes.

So the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that includes only 2. The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → includes 4, which is a no.
B) 3 and 4 → no.
C) 2 and 3 → 3 is no.
D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating point 4. Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂) with substituents on opposite sides. Now, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and a double bond. So each of these carbons has two identical substituents (COOCH3), a double bond, and a hydrogen. So each is attached to three different groups plus the double bond, but the two COOCH3 are same. So no chiral centers.

But wait, perhaps the molecule as a whole is chiral, even without any chiral centers. For example, allenes can be chiral without chiral centers if they lack a plane of symmetry.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, if the substituents are on opposite sides, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine: if the molecule is symmetrical along the plane that bisects the double bond, then it's achiral. So, if the COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, the molecule might have a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetric. Let me think of the molecule: if the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, then the molecule is symmetrical along the double bond's axis. So it's not chiral.

Wait, but in reality, I think that dimethyl fumarate is actually a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but not necessarily chiral. So it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is number 2.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. The options are:

A) 1, 2, 4 → includes 2 and 4, but 4 is a no.
B) 3 and 4 → no.
C) 2 and 3 → no.
D) 1 and 2 → no.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option A includes 1,2,4. I thought 1 and 4 are no, but perhaps I was wrong about 1.

Waiting to reevaluate point 1.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, which are para. So each ring's substituents are across from each other. Now, in the biphenyl, the two rings are connected by a single bond, which allows rotation. But the substituents are all at para positions relative to the central bond.

Now, considering the molecule as a whole, does it have any planes of symmetry?

If the substituents on both rings are arranged in a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical, it would be achiral. But if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes it achiral.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement of substituents on each ring being para makes the entire molecule symmetrical. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So point 1 is a no.

Thus, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is number 2. But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another point.

Wait, let me think again about the options. Are there any other possibilities?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in point 4. Let me think again: is dimethyl fumarate a chiral molecule?

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me imagine the structure of dimethyl fumarate and whether it has any chiral centers.

Dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, with the substituents on opposite sides.

Each of the two carbons in the double bond (CH₂ groups) is attached to two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and a double bond.

So each carbon has four substituents: two COOCH3, one H, and the double bond. But wait, in reality, the double bond is a sigma bond, and the substituents are:

For each CH₂ group:

- Two COOCH3 groups
- One H
- One CH₂ group (but that's connected via a double bond, so perhaps it's considered as a substituent)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps each carbon in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups, a hydrogen, and the double bond (which is a substituent). So each carbon has four substituents, but two of them are the same (COOCH3 groups). Therefore, each carbon isn't a chiral center.

Thus, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral. Therefore, point 4 is a no.

So, after reevaluating, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2. But looking at the options, there's no option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in evaluating point 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A and option D.

Wait, option A includes 1,2,4. If I'm wrong about point 1, perhaps it's a yes, making option A the correct answer.

But I thought point 1 is a no. Alternatively, perhaps point 1 is a yes.

Wait, another approach: if the biphenyl substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, but arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it's chiral.

Wait, if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. So it's achiral.

But perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on the same face of the biphenyl, creating a chiral arrangement.

Wait, but I'm not sure. This is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2 and 4.

But I'm not confident, so perhaps I should make a decision based on the analysis so far.

The only compound that definitely shows optical isomerism is number 2. But since none of the options include only 2, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating point 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is trans. Is there any chance that this makes the molecule chiral?

Wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical and thus is chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

Wait, but in fumarate, the substituents are trans, which can create a certain symmetry.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, which is achiral despite having stereocenters. But in reality, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereocenters because each carbon in the double bond has two identical substituents.

Therefore, the only compound that is chiral is number 2. But since none of the options include only 2, perhaps the correct option is A) 1,2,4, but I'm not sure.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating point 4. Let me think again: dimethyl fumarate is formed from fumaric acid, which is a trans diacid. The diastereomer of maleic acid. Now, does this mean that dimethyl fumarate is a geometric isomer but not chiral?

Yes, because geometric isomerism is not the same as optical isomerism. Geometric isomerism arises due to spatial arrangement around double bonds, not due to chirality. So dimethyl fumarate has no chiral centers and isn't chiral. So point 4 is a no.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is number 2. But the options don't have an option for just 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating point 1.

Wait, perhaps point 1 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again. The structure is biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para. So each ring has substituents across from each other.

Now, the biphenyl allows rotation, but the substituents are all at para positions. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus achiral. So point 1 is a no.

In that case, the only correct answer is number 2, but no option includes only 2. So perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct answer. But I can't do that, so I'll have to make an educated guess.

Based on my analysis, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is number 2. But since the options don't have that, the closest option would be A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps point 4 does exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. If not, it's chiral.

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond. So if you imagine the molecule, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, which could create a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the molecule is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, point 4 is a no.

So, the only correct answer is number 2. But since no option includes only 2, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the other options again.

Option A: 1,2,4 → includes 4 which I think is no.

Option D: 1 and 2 → 1 is no.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in point 1. Let me imagine the structure again. If the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6 (para), and the other ring has substituents at 2' and 6', which are also para, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry along the line connecting the two central carbons. So the molecule is symmetrical and thus achiral. Therefore, point 1 is a no.

Thus, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is number 2. But the options don't include this, so perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, assuming that point 4 is a yes.

But I'm not confident, so I'll have to choose based on my analysis.

The correct answer, based on my analysis, is that only number 2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't include this, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in point 4. Let me think again: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a chiral molecule because it lacks a plane of symmetry despite having substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate isn't symmetrical, making it chiral. For example, if the ester groups are on opposite sides, but the molecule as a whole doesn't have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

I think I'm stuck, so I'll proceed with what I believe is correct: only number 2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, I'll have to choose the option that includes 2 and any others I might have incorrectly evaluated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in point 4 and it does show optical isomerism. Then, the correct answer would be option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option A) 1,2,4 as the answer, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but not a chiral compound. Thus, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is number 2. But since the options don't include that, perhaps the correct option is not present, but that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in point 2. Let me reevaluate point 2 again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (second carbon) has:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- CH2OH (from the other side)
- H.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct the structure.

The correct structure is CH3–CH(OH)–COOCH3.

Wait, no, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be:

CH3–CH(OH)–COOCH3.

So the second carbon (middle one) has:

- OH
- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- And a hydrogen.

So substituents are:

CH3, COOCH3, OH, H.

All four substituents are different, making the second carbon a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center and exhibits optical isomerism.

Thus, point 2 is correct.

So, the correct answer should include only 2, but the options don't have that. The closest option is option A, which includes 2, but I'm not sure about the others.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating point 1. Let me think again: point 1's structure has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. Otherwise, it's not.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para. So each ring's substituents are symmetric. When considering both rings, the arrangement could be symmetric, making the molecule achiral. So point 1 is a no.

Thus, the correct answer includes only 2, but since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the other compounds.

Wait, perhaps benzophenone (point 3) has a plane of symmetry and is not chiral. So point 3 is a no.

Hmm.

Well, I've spent a lot of time thinking, and I think the correct answer is that only point 2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident, so I'll have to go with the best conclusion I can.


To determine which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or lacks a plane of symmetry, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents on each ring are para to each other, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃–CH(OH)–COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph–C(=O)–Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and has two identical phenyl groups as substituents. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate has the structure CH₂=CH(COOCH₃)₂, with the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical COOCH₃ groups, a hydrogen, and the double bond. Since the carbons in the double bond are not chiral centers, the molecule as a whole is achiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 1, 2, and 4**: Incorrect. While compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, compounds 1 and 4 do not.  
- **B) 3 and 4**: Incorrect. Neither compound 3 nor 4 exhibits optical isomerism.  
- **C) 2 and 3**: Incorrect. Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but compound 3 does not.  
- **D) 1 and 2**: Incorrect. Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but compound 1 does not.

### Conclusion:
The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)**. However, none of the provided options correctly include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the closest option is **A) 1, 2, and 4**, though it incorrectly includes compounds 1 and 4.

Answer: A
