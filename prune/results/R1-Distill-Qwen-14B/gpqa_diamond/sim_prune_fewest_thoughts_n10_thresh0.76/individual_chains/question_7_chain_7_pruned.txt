Okay, so I've got this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The CMB photons have an average energy of 1e-3 eV.

Wait, so the reaction is γ + γ → e+ + e-. I remember that this process is a photon-photon annihilation. But gamma rays are high-energy, so I guess this is about high-energy gamma interacting with the low-energy CMB photons.

I think this has something to do with the photon's lifetime in the universe. The lifetime is limited by processes that cause them to disappear, like annihilation. So, when a gamma-ray annihilates with a CMB photon, it can't travel as far, which affects its observed flux. So, the energy at which this process becomes significant determines the maximum energy we can observe gamma-rays from distant sources.

I recall that this limit comes from the balance between the production of the gamma-rays and their annihilation. The optical depth is a measure of how likely a gamma-ray is to annihilate before traveling to us. The optical depth τ is given by the cross-section σ multiplied by the number of target photons N. When τ ≈ 1, the probability of annihilation is about 37% (since e^-τ ≈ 0.63, so 1 - 0.63 = 0.37).

So to find the energy where τ ≈ 1, I need to compute when σ * N becomes approximately 1.

The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is something I need to figure out. Wait, I think the cross-section for this process is given by σ ≈ (8π/9) * (α^2 / m_e^2) * (1/( (E_γ * E_CMB) )) ) * ( E_γ + E_CMB )^2. Or wait, maybe it's better to recall the approximate form. Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for γγ → e+e- scales as σ ≈ (σ_T / 4) * (E_γ * E_CMB) / (m_e^2 c^4) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the typical expression for this cross-section.

Alternatively, I think the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (8π/9) * (α^2 / (4E_γ E_photon)) ) * (E_γ + E_photon)^2, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for a more general approach.

Wait, another approach. The cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/9) * [ (α^2) / (4 E_γ E_photon) ) ] * (E_γ + E_photon)^2 / (m_e^2 c^4) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the process and use the formula for the cross-section. Alternatively, maybe I should recall the formula for the photon-photon cross-section for pair production.

Another approach: The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is given by:

σ = (8π / 9) * (α² / (E₁ E₂)) * (E₁ + E₂)^2 / (m_e² c^4)

Wait, probably, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I think that the cross-section can be approximated as σ ≈ (σ_T c) (E_photon / E_gamma) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the typical expressions from textbooks.

Wait, the cross-section for photon-photon pair production is often written as:

σ = (8π/9) * (α² / (E₁ E₂)) * (E₁ + E₂)^2 / (m_e² c^4)

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, another formula I found in some notes is:

σ = (8π/9) * (α² / (E₁ E₂)) * (E₁ + E₂)^2 / (m_e² c^4) )

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the typical energy where this process becomes important. The energy scale is determined by the condition that the optical depth τ equals 1.

The optical depth τ is given by:

τ = σ * n_target * L

Wait, no, more accurately, τ = σ * n_target * x, where x is the path length. Alternatively, in cosmological terms, the number density n of CMB photons is about 1 per cubic centimeter or so. Wait, the CMB photon density is about n ≈ 10^8 photons/cm^3, since the CMB temperature is ~2.7 K, and the photon density in a blackbody is proportional to T^3, so yeah, that's around 400 photons per cm^3 or so.

Wait, let me compute the number density of CMB photons. The number density n is given by n = (8 π U) / (h c^2), where U is the energy density of the CMB. The energy density U is (1/2) k_B T^4 * (8 π / (h c)^3) ), wait no, better to think in terms of the photon number density formula.

The number density of photons in the CMB is given by:

n_γ = (8 π / (h^3 c^3)) * (k_B T)^4 * (1/ (e^{h c/(k_B T)} - 1)) ) * (1/(h c/(k_B T)) )) )

Wait, that's a bit complicated, but since T is 2.7 K, and the photon distribution is thermal, the average photon number can be approximated by n_γ ≈ 10^8 photons/m^3, which is 1e8 cm^-3. Because 1 m^3 is 1e6 liters, but maybe I'm mixing units. Wait, 1 m^3 is 1e6 liters, and 1 liter is about 1000 cm^3, no, wait: 1 m^3 is (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm^3. So a number density of 1e8 photons/m^3 is 1e8 / 1e6 = 100 photons/cm^3. Wait, wait, no, no: wait, 1 m^3 is 1e6 liters, and 1 liter is 1000 cm^3, so 1 m^3 is 1e9 cm^3. So if n_γ is 1e8 photons/m^3, that's 1e8 / 1e9 = 0.1 photons/cm^3. But that can't be right because I thought the CMB has about 1 photon per cm^3.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. The number density of photons in the CMB is given by the formula from the blackbody spectrum. The number of photons per unit volume is:

n_γ = (8 π / (h^3 c^3)) * ∫_{0}^{∞} x^2 / (e^x - 1) dx * (k_B T)^4

The integral ∫ x²/(e^x -1) dx from 0 to ∞ is π^4/15 ≈ 6.49. So,

n_γ = (8 π) / (h^3 c^3) ) * 6.49 * (k_B T)^4

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K

T ≈ 2.7 K.

Calculating:

n_γ = (8 * π) / ( (6.626e-34)^3 * (3e8)^3 ) ) * 6.49 * (1.
