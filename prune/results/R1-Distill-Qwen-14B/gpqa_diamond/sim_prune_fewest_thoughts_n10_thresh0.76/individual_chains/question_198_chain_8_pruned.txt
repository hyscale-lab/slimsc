Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, first, I need to remember what these stability constants mean. Stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it requires a higher concentration of products to dissociate. So, the higher the β, the more the complex will form.

The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. The stability constant βn is for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So, β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- (since each SCN- is -1, three would make -3; but Co is +2, so the charge would be -1?), wait, maybe I should think about the charges more carefully.

Wait, Co is +2. Each SCN- is -1. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) would be 2 - n. Because each SCN is -1, n of them make -n. So 2 -n is the charge.

So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+ (2-1=+1)
n=2, Co(SCN)_2^0 (2-2=0)
n=3, Co(SCN)_3^- (2-3=-1)
n=4, Co(SCN)_4^2- (2-4=-2)

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So the complexes are:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} with βn = [ [
