Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and ending with a final product, and we need to figure out which option is correct.

First, let's break down each reaction step by step.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration typically occurs when benzene reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) in the presence of a sulfuric acid catalyst. The nitration adds a nitro group (-NO2) to benzene. But where does it go? Nitration is an electrophilic substitution reaction. Benzene tends to substitute in the meta position when there's a strong meta-directing group, but wait, benzene itself doesn't have any substituents, so the nitro group can attach in any position. Wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so the product is just nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, nitration of benzene adds the nitro group in a specific position. But since the benzene ring is symmetric, the nitration will produce a single product, which is nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Hmm, Br2 with Fe is usually a reagent for substitution reactions. Wait, when you have Br2 and Fe in a
