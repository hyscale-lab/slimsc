Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically occurs in 1,5-dienes to form another 1,5-diene. The reaction involves the shifting of a sigma bond, moving a group from one end of a conjugated diene to the other.

The compound in question is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize or draw its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a bridge with two carbons on one bridge and one on the other. The numbering would be such that the bridgeheads are at positions 1 and 4. The molecule also has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached at position 2, and there's a double bond at position 5.

Wait, so the structure is a bicyclic system with a bridge. Let me see, position 2 has a vinyl substituent, and there's a double bond in the ring. So, the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. The 'aza' part means there's a nitrogen in the ring, so it's a bicyclic amine.

Now, the Cope rearrangement. The key here is that the reaction occurs in 1,5-dienes. So perhaps the molecule must have such a diene arrangement. But wait, in a bicyclo structure, the diene might be part of the ring or bridge.

Let me think about the structure. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridgehead carbons, 1 and 4. The ring is made of a five-membered and a four-membered ring, I think. Position 2 is adjacent to the bridgehead at 1. The vinyl group is at position 2, so that's a CH2-CH2 group attached there?

Wait, maybe it's better to sketch this mentally. So, 1 is connected to 2 and 5. Position 2 has a vinyl group (like CH2-CH2), but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-.
