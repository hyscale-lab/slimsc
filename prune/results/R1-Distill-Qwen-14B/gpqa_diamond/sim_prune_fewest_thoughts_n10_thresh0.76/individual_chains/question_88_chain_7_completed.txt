Okay, so I have this question here about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but let's try to think it through.

The question says someone tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they did in vivo imaging and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, because the stomach has a lot of acid, which would break down the proteins, right? But then some made it through and got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Wait, secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches, I think. So they isolated the Peyer patches and looked at the proliferating cells. They sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability.

So the question is, which process is happening here?

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

I remember that VDJ recombination is part of the process during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's how the variable, diversity, and joining segments are rearranged to create the diverse B cell receptors. But wait, that happens early on, during the maturation of B cells.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, happens after the B cell has been activated. It's a process during the immune response where the variable regions of the B cell receptor are mutated, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This usually happens in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs.

Class switching is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which is also a later process, after activation.

So in this question, the GFP-tagged proteins are getting into the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to antigens in the gut are initiated.

When the rotavirus capsid proteins are taken up, they are likely processed and presented by antigen-presenting cells, maybe like dendritic cells or macrophages. These cells would then present the antigen to B cells in the Peyer patches. Then, the B cells would get activated.

Now, the variable heavy chain gene sequencing shows high variability in the isolated cells. That suggests that the B cells are undergoing some process that increases the diversity of their receptors. Somatic hypermutation is known for this because it introduces point mutations in the variable regions, leading to more diverse antibodies. This process occurs after the initial antigen encounter and is part of the immune response's way of fine-tuning the B cell receptors.

VDJ recombination is more about the initial diversity generated in the bone marrow, not after the B cell has already left and is in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. So in this case, the B cells are in the Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines. So the process would be happening in the periphery, post-antigen encounter.

So, the high variability in the variable regions is likely due to somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence imaging reveals that some of the tagged proteins are destroyed by stomach acid, while others reach the Peyer patches, where they are isolated from proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells shows high variability, indicating a process that increases the diversity of the B cell receptors.

To determine which process is occurring, the options are analyzed:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors after antigen activation, increasing diversity. It occurs in secondary lymphoid tissues like Peyer patches, aligning with the experiment's observations.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is a part of the immune response that targets pathogens for destruction but does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody produced but does not generate variability in the variable regions of the receptor.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity. However, it does not explain the observed variability in mature B cells in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches after antigen activation. This process fine-tunes B cell receptors to increase their diversity and specificity.

Answer: A
