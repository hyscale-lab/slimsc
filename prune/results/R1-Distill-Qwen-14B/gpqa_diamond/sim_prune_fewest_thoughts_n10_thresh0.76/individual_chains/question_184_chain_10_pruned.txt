Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

First, I need to figure out the structure. Let me draw it out in my mind. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering is a bit tricky here. Let me think: in benzene, the numbering starts such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3 has nitro.

So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So on the ring, in order, it's ethoxy at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Let me visualize: benzene ring, substituents at 1, 2, and 3. So starting from position 1: ethoxy, then moving to position 2: tert-butyl, and position 3: nitro.

Now, the synthesis steps involve benzene undergoing several reactions. The options give a series of reactions, and I need to pick the correct order.

I remember that when adding substituents to benzene, the order of reactions can affect the positions due to directing effects. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups already present.

Let me think about each substituent and their directing effects. Ethoxy is an activating group, ortho/para directing. Nitro is a deactivating, meta directing group. tert-Butyl (as an alkyl group) is activating, ortho/para directing.

But wait, the nitro group is meta directing. So, if we have nitro and ethoxy already on the ring, any new substituent will be directed based on their positions. But in this case, the target has three substituents, so the order of addition matters a lot.

Wait, starting from benzene, which is a blank ring. The first substituent will determine the positions of the others.

So, let me think about the possible steps. The target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let's consider the possible order of adding these groups.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. That's possible. Using a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3. Then, perhaps introduce nitro and ethoxy groups.

But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. tert-Butyl is an activating group, so that's fine. So, after adding the tert-butyl group, the next substituent can be introduced.

But adding nitro groups could be tricky. Nitration is an electrophilic substitution. So, if the ring has an activating
