Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of organic chemistry reactions, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product, product 4.

First, I'll try to outline each step and see what's happening.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? Its structure is a six-membered ring with one ketone group (O=C-) attached.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), forming product 1. Hmm, what reaction does bromine do with a ketone? I think bromine in a non-polar solvent like CCl4 might lead to an addition reaction, but wait, wait. Oh, wait! I think that Br2 can undergo a ring-opening reaction in cyclic ketones like cyclohexanone. Or maybe it's a diels-alder type? No, wait, another possibility: the ring might undergo bromination. Wait, no, cyclohexanone is a ketone, so maybe it's an addition across the carbonyl group. Wait, another thought: when a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it might form a bromohydrin. Oh wait, no, bromohydrin is when you have water and bromine. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening via an electrophilic attack. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe
