Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's asking. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is distance equals 1 over parallax, right? So plx is in parsecs usually.

Wait, the number of stars varies with 1/plx^5. But parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if I let d be the distance, then plx = 1/d. So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ (1/plx)^5. But since d = 1/plx, then 1/plx is d. So substituting that in, N ∝ d^5. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 over plx^5 is (1/plx)^5, which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Per unit range of distance r. Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being asked here. So the number of stars in a region varies with distance, and we're considering per unit distance, like the density perhaps?

Let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then how does N change as d increases? Well, for each unit increase in d, N increases by a factor that depends on d. But the question is about per unit range of distance. So maybe it's the derivative of N with respect to d?

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the distribution of stars as a function of distance. So N is the number of stars in a certain volume as a function of distance. But wait, in a region of the sky, perhaps it's considering a thin slice, so the volume would be area times distance (since it's a thin shell, so volume approx area * thickness, which for a unit thickness, it's area * 1. But maybe the problem is more about the number density.)

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5,
