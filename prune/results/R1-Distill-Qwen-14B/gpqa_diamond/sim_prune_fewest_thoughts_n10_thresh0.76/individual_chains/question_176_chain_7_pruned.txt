Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the probability of getting specific outcomes after measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, hold on, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors with complex numbers, but here the entries are real numbers. Hmm. Also, the state vector should be normalized, right? Because the sum of the squares of the absolute values should equal 1.

Let me check the normalization. The state is (-1, 2, 1). So, the squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up gives 6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. That's a problem because probabilities have to add up to 1. So perhaps I need to normalize it first. The norm is sqrt(6), so each component should be divided by sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. I'll keep that in mind.

Now, the operators P and Q are given. Let me write down their matrices. 

Operator P's matrix is:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix is diagonal:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, and -1. But the question is about measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, no, the question says the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So first, after measuring P and getting 0, then measuring Q and getting -1.

Wait, no, the question says: someone measures Q just after the
