Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing two terms in a hydrogen atom under a magnetic field. Hmm, let's see... I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz, which I guess is the z-axis. And m is small. Oh wait, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Right, m can be -1, 0, +1 or something like that for different orbital angular momentum states.

The problem is asking me to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman effect term) to the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I remember is around the wavelength for the Balmer series in hydrogen. Balmer-alpha maybe? Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is about 656 nm, but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is actually the Balmer-beta line. Hmm, I might need to double-check that, but maybe that's not too important for this calculation.

So, the main task is to find whether the magnetic coupling term is much bigger, much smaller, or similar to the transition energy ΔE.

First, I should figure out what ΔE is. The transition energy is given by the wavelength via the equation E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

But wait, I need to know the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm or 486.1 x 10^-9 meters.

So plugging into E = hc/λ:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m)

Let me compute that numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.987
