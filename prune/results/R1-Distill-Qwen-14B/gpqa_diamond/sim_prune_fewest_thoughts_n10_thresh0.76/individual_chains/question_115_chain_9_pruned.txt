Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about. 

So, there's an electron and a positron. The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured: one is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of the photons.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are matter and antimatter, their annihilation should release energy, probably in the form of gamma photons. But wait, in this case, it produces two photons. I've heard about this before, like when a particle and antiparticle annihilate, they produce two photons moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

Wait, but wait, the problem says both photons have the same energy. So, their energies are equal. But their directions are both to the right but one up and one down. So, their angle apart is what's being asked.

Let me think about conservation laws here. Because in any interaction, momentum and energy must be conserved. Since the initial particles are moving, their momenta must add up, and after annihilation, the photons' momenta must add up to the same total.

First, I should calculate the total momentum before annihilation. The electron is moving from the left, so let's say its velocity is to the right. Wait, no, the electron is moving from the left (so initial direction is to the right?), and the positron is moving from the right, so its direction is to the left? Wait, wait, the question says both are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, so to the right; the positron is moving from the right, so to the left. Hmm, that's important for their velocities.

Wait, but the Lorentz factor is given for each. The Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). So, higher gamma means higher velocity, closer to c.

So, each particle has their own momentum. Let's compute their momenta.
