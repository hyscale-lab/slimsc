Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an annihilation process: a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles of type A⁺ and two of A⁻. The reaction is written as p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A from the options given.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should think about what's conserved in this reaction. Since it's an annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, right, that probably means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe I can approximate that the antiproton is at rest? Or wait, no, because the antiproton is moving towards the proton. Wait, but the problem says it's moving slowly, so perhaps the velocity is low, so relativistic effects are not too significant. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate that the initial momentum is negligible. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, let's think about the initial setup. The proton is a matter particle, and the antiproton is antimatter. So when they annihilate, they produce other particles. In the center of mass frame, perhaps? Because in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial frame is where the antiproton is moving, but slowly, so the lab frame is such that the proton is at rest? Or no, perhaps the proton is moving towards the antiproton? Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with a small velocity.

Wait, the problem states: "The antiproton is slowly moving." So maybe in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a small velocity. But for a more precise calculation, perhaps I need to consider their momenta.

But maybe a better approach is to consider conservation of energy and momentum in the center of mass frame. Because in that frame, the total initial momentum is zero, so the products must have zero net momentum.

Wait, but the initial particles are a
