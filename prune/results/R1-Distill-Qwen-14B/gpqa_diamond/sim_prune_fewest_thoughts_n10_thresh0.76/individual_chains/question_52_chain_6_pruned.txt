Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of these spots is causing the star's overall temperature to decrease.

Now, the main part of the question involves the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã… (which is in the near-ultraviolet range, I think). We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So, the factor would be (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

The key here is that the stellar photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which means we can apply the Boltzmann equation for the population of these energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (or degeneracies) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels (E2 > E1).
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio we're interested in is (n2 / n1) when there are no spots (T1 = 6000 K) divided by the same ratio when there are spots (T2 = 5500 K).

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. But maybe the spots themselves are cooler regions. So, perhaps the photosphere without spots is at a higher temperature, and the spots are regions where the temperature is lower. But in the problem, it says that 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So, the effective temperature is a weighted average of the two regions?

Hmm, but the problem says that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the spots have a lower temperature, T_spot, and the remaining 60% has a higher temperature. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Because the question is about the ratio in each part.

Wait, no. Because the question is about the ratio observed in the photosphere as a whole. So, perhaps the spots change the overall temperature, and we can model the effective temperature as 5500 K when spots are present. But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So, the photosphere as a whole has a lower temperature.

Wait, but how does that affect the ratio? The ratio depends on the local temperature where the absorption lines are formed. Oh, wait, but the question says that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region (spot and non-spot) would have its own temperature and its own level populations.

But wait, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, perhaps the effective temperature is a combination of the brightness from the spotted and non-spotted areas. But for the purpose of the ratio,
