Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is Lithium. So naturally, Lithium has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

The question is about relativistic energy. I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by its rest mass energy. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

So the formula is E = gamma * m0c². But wait, I'm in a physics class, and I need to compute gamma first. Let me think, what's v here? It's 0.96c. So v = 0.96c. So, beta is v/c = 0.96.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). Let me calculate that. Beta squared is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate it exactly.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857...

But wait, that's just the gamma. Now, the rest mass energy, m0c², for the nucleus. The nucleus is a Li-6 ion. So I need the mass of Li-6. I think the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c² each. Wait
