Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact factors that influence the probability of a planet transiting.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, but the RV method gives us the minimum mass because we don't know the inclination of the orbit.

Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, I think. They both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies calculations because eccentricity doesn't add complications here.

The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting. So even though the more massive star is probably larger, in this case, they have the same radius. Wait, no, the radius is the same? Because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, maybe a subgiant, but same radius as the main-sequence star hosting Planet_1. Hmm, that might affect the transit probability because the size of the star relative to the planet matters.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, but also the orbital distance. Let me think, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (something else?), wait, no, I think the formula is (R_*/ a) * (1 + (R_p / R_* ))^2, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's more about the relative size of the star and the distance.

Wait, the transit probability is actually given by the formula (R_star / a) multiplied by the sine of the inclination, but since we're considering the maximum possible probability (when the orbit is edge-on), the probability is (R_star / a). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The transit probability is the ratio
