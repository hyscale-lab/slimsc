Okay, so I've got this question about a peptidic compound's analysis. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR and mass spectrometry, but let me try to piece it together.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks like it should be the expected molecule, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Wait, alpha-proton is typically the one attached to the carbon next to the carbonyl, like in an amide. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each peak is integrating to about 0.5H maybe? 

The first thought is about splitting due to coupling. But the question states that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like a doublet of doublets or something where each proton is coupling with another. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then there's the LC-MS analysis. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, meaning same molecular weight. So if their masses are the same, but they're separate peaks, what does that imply? Maybe it's not a matter of adducts or isotopic peaks because those would be minor and maybe not two separate peaks. Also, the same mass spectrum implies same molecular formula.

So the options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. That would mean another compound with a lower mass. But LC-MS shows same mass, so this is unlikely. Precursors have lower masses, so their MS would show a different m/z. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they'd have identical physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. But in NMR, if the sample isn't in a chiral environment (like a regular NMR tube without a chiral additive), the enantiomers would look identical. Unless the compound itself has some chiral centers that cause diastereotopic protons, but that's more about diastereomers. Wait, but if there are two enantiomers, each would give the same NMR signals because the environment is the same. Unless the sample is racemic and the NMR can't tell them apart because they're identical in that spectrum. Wait, but the question says that the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So that suggests something else. Enantiomers wouldn't split the peak because the protons are in equivalent environments. So maybe B is not the answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what that refers to. Wait, during amide formation, like in an SN2 reaction or something? Maybe it's about when forming the amide, the proton could couple with two different groups. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so perhaps it's not that. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of the amide leading to some kind of coupling that creates additional peaks. Not entirely sure about this
