Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked. Hmm.

Alright, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. Because of this compound, it can't be used for food. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and they’re looking at the target gene sequences in each mutant. The question is asking which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene sequence is given, and then there are four mutants (1-4), each with a different change. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a mutant.

So, the main thing here is figuring out which mutation would disable the gene's function, thereby stopping the production of the anti-nutritional compound. Usually, disabling a gene can be done by disrupting the coding sequence, like causing a premature stop codon or altering the reading frame leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the mutants, I need to see where the changes are and how they affect the protein. The changes are in the first exon area, so all the mutations are in the same region. Let's look at each mutant's sequence compared to the wild type.

The wild type starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let's write this out and compare.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Let me compare each part. Let's break down the wild type and mutant 1:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, maybe it's easier to look at the exact differences. Let's compare each triplet or each base.

Wait, perhaps I should line them up. Let me write out the wild type and each mutant line by line.

Wild type: 5'-ATG TTTC TCG C TG G TAC TT C TGT GGA TGA A CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...TGA-3'
Mutant1: ATG TTCT AC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATT... etc.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact point where the change occurs.

Alternatively, I can look for where the changes are in the amino acid sequence. Since the exons are coding regions, any change in the nucleotide sequence would affect the amino acids.

Each of the changes is in the first exon. Let me compare each mutant to the wild type.

Wild type: first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Looking at the first part:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, let's find the exact point where they differ. Let's count the bases.

Looking at the first few nucleotides:

Wild type: positions 1-100 (hypothetically):

1-3: ATG (start)

4-6: TTT (Phe)

7-9: CTC (Leu)

10-12: GCT (Ala)

13-15: GGT (Gly)

16-18: ACT (Thr)
