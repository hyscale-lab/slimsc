Okay, so I have this physics problem here about potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's try to think through it.

The question says: A charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together. But here, we have a conducting sphere which is grounded. Oh right, grounding means that the sphere is connected to the earth, which is a large conductor that can provide or remove charges as needed. So the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded, right?

But wait, wait. The charge q is placed near the sphere. So since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the charges on it will redistribute. But wait, the sphere is neutral? Or is it initially neutral? Oh, the problem doesn't say anything about the sphere's initial charge, so I guess it's neutral. So the sphere is a conductor, so charges will reside on its surface.

But when you bring a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will adjust. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface must be zero (because it's at the same potential as earth). So the induced charges would arrange themselves to make the surface potential zero.

Wait, but how does that affect the potential energy? The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. In this case, maybe we can model the sphere as a point charge at its center when considering external charges? Because for a conducting sphere, the electric field outside is like that of a point charge at the center.

But wait, the sphere is grounded. So if I bring a charge q near it, the sphere will have induced charges. Since the sphere is neutral, the induced charges would be -q on the near side and +q on the far side, but wait no, because the sphere is grounded, charges can flow to or from the earth. Wait, no, when a charge is placed near a grounded conductor, the conductor's surface will have induced opposite charges, but because it's grounded, the conductor's net charge remains zero. So the induced charge on the sphere would be -q on the side closer to q, but the far side would have +q. But wait, the sum is zero.

Wait, no. Let's think. The sphere was initially neutral. Bringing a charge q near it will cause the electrons in the sphere to be attracted to the near side, making that side negatively charged. The far side would be positively charged. But because the sphere is grounded, the excess negative charge on the near side can flow into the earth, and positive charges (lack of electrons) on the far side can be replenished from the earth. So the conductor ends up with a charge distribution such that the potential on the surface is zero.

Hmm, but how does this affect the potential energy?

Potential energy between two point charges is U = (1/2) k q1 q2 / r. But here, it's a charge and a sphere. But since the sphere is a conductor and grounded, maybe we can model the induced charge as an image charge.

Wait, image charge method. For a grounded sphere, the image charge method would place an image charge inside the sphere. Oh wait, image charge method is
