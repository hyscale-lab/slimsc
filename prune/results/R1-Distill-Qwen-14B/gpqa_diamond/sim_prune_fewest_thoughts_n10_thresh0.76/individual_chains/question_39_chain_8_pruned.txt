Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's the same and under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of "a". The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's probability density must integrate to 1 over all space because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the wave function is a complex number. The standard approach is to take the complex conjugate and multiply, then integrate. So the probability density is |ψ|² = ψ* ψ.

Let me write that out. ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ* would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i because the complex conjugate changes the sign of the imaginary part.

So |ψ|² = [(a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] * [(a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i]. Multiplying these out, it's like (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms (the ones with i) will cancel out when subtracting squares. Wait, no, let me actually compute it.

Multiplying term by term:
First term: a/sqrt(1+x) * a/sqrt(1+x) = a²/(1+x)
Second term: a/sqrt(1+x) * 0.5i = 0.5 a i / sqrt(1+x)
Third term: -0.5i * a/sqrt(1+x) = -0.5 a i / sqrt(1+x)
Fourth term: -0.5i * 0.5i = -0.25 i². Since i² is -1, this becomes +0.25.

So adding all terms together, the second and third terms cancel each other because they're imaginary and opposite in sign. So the result is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, wait a second. So |ψ|² = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25. Hmm. But that seems a bit off because usually, the probability density should depend on x, but maybe it's correct.

But wait, the problem states that when measuring, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. But in the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))
