Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? Oh wait, no, beta is 1/(kT), but the formula is Z = sum exp(-E/(kT)), which is the same as sum exp(-β E). But in the problem, β is given as 1/(kT), so I can just use that.

So each spin has two states: +1 and -1. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. So I'll need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states and then sum up the exponentials.

Let me list all possible states. Spin configurations are S1, S2, S3 each being +1 or -1.

Wait, but perhaps there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the symmetry. Maybe group states based on the number of +1 and -1 spins or some other pattern.

The energy is E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). Let me compute each term. So each pair product S_i S_j is either +1 or -1.

Wait, S_i and S_j can be +1 or -1. So S_i S_j is +1 if they are the same, -1 if different. So each term in the sum is either +1 or -1.

So each of the three terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be +1 or -1. Therefore, the sum inside the brackets can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2. Because each term is ±1, adding three gives max 3, min -3.

So the possible values of [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3] are -3, -1, +1, +3.

Wait no, wait. Let's think: for three terms each ±1, the sum could be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two
