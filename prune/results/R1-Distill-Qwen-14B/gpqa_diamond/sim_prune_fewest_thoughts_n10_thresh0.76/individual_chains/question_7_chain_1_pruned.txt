Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The reaction is gamma gamma → e+ e-. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-rays' lifetimes in the universe are limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean free path is determined by the probability of such interactions. If the probability is high enough, they'll annihilate quickly, thus limiting their lifetime.

So, the key here is to find the energy where the optical depth becomes significant. Optical depth, τ, is the probability that a photon will interact before traveling a certain distance. For the lifetime to be limited, I think τ should be around 1, which is when the interaction becomes significant.

The process in question is pair production via the interaction of two photons: γ + γ → e+ + e-. The cross-section for this process as a function of the center-of-mass energy must be known. I recall that the cross-section for this reaction has a specific form. Wait, the cross-section σ is proportional to (E_cm)^2 divided by the square of the Planck constant or something like that. Oh, right, the cross-section for photon-photon to electron-positron is given by σ ≈ (8πα² m_e²)/(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, and α is the fine-structure constant.

Wait, actually, I think I might have it wrong. Let me think again. The cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by σ = (8π α² m_e²) / (s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Or maybe s is (E1 + E2)^2? Because in the center-of-mass frame, the energy is sqrt(s). Hmm.

Wait, the cross-section formula for two photons colliding to produce electron-positron pairs is σ = (8 π α^2 m_e^2) / (s), where s = (E1 + E2)^2 when the photons are moving in opposite directions. But wait, in the case of the CMB, the photons are isotropic, but for a high-energy gamma-ray moving through the CMB, the typical interaction is with a photon of energy ε (like the CMB photons). So if the gamma-ray has energy E, then the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E + ε)^2? Or maybe it's s= (E + ε)^2, but considering that one photon is moving in the opposite direction, so the invariant s is actually ( (E + ε) )^2 if they are moving head-on. Wait, in the lab frame where the CMB is isotropic, but for a single interaction, it's a head-on collision, so the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E + ε)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 ) or something like that. Wait, photons are massless, so their energy is equal to their momentum times c. So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so the momentum terms subtract. Wait, no. Let me think: if photon 1 has energy E and momentum p = E/c in direction +x, photon 2 has energy ε and momentum p = ε/c in direction -x. Then, the total energy is E + ε, and the total momentum is (E/c) - (ε/c). So the invariant s is (E + ε)^2 - [ (E - ε)/c * c ]^2. Wait, because p_total is (E - ε)/c in the +x direction. So s is (E + ε)^2 - (E - ε)^2.

Let me compute that: (E + ε)^2 =
