Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types, moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is gamma = E/(m cÂ²), and it's related to time dilation and length contraction. But wait, in this context, the key thing is probably how far the particles travel before decaying. Because the particles are fast-decaying, so they don't live long. The ones that reach the detector walls must have a longer lifetime (from our frame) to make it that distance.

Wait, wait. So the particles are moving at a high speed, and they decay quickly. So the ones that reach the detector walls are those that live long enough to traverse the detector's radius. So the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor (gamma) will give the dilated lifetime in our lab frame. So the distance traveled would be velocity times that dilated lifetime.

Wait, but the velocity is v, and since they're ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c. So maybe we can approximate v as c for simplicity. So the distance is v * gamma * proper lifetime (tau) = c * gamma tau.

But if gamma is higher, the particle's lifetime is longer as observed in the lab frame, so they can travel further. So the question is about how the fraction of particles reaching the detector depends on gamma.

Wait, the problem says that when gamma is 20, one third reach the walls. Now, they want to find the gamma where two-thirds reach the walls. So I think it's about the particles' decay lengths.

The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So the decay length L is c * gamma * tau.

The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So particles that have a decay length L >=
