Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of organic reactions, and we need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's break it down.

Alright, starting with compound A, which is C3H6. Wait, C3H6 is propene or propane? No, wait, propane would be C3H8. So propene, since it's C3H6. Propene is an alkene, right? So when propene undergoes bromination in CCl4, that's a typical addition reaction. The bromine adds across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, wait, I think the addition is typically anti and across the double bond, so the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So that's compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so that's probably an elimination reaction. So when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with KOH, it would eliminate HBr. Wait, no, wait, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When KOH is present, it would deprotonate and eliminate Br- as leaving groups. Let me think, elimination would form an alkene again. But which position? Since both carbons are brominated, the elimination would form either 1-propene or an internal alkene. Wait, the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane. So the possible alkenes from elimination would be between carbons 1 and 2, but wait, wait, if you eliminate H from carbon 1 and Br from carbon 2, that would form a double bond between 1 and 2. Or if you eliminate from carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no, because in 1,2-dibromopropane, the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So if you eliminate H from CH2Br and Br from CHBr, you get CH2=CH-CH3 as product. Or wait, maybe it could be either 1-propene (propene) or 2-propene (which is the same as propene since it's CH2=CHCH3). So compound
