Okay, so I have this problem about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The solution has two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1 gram each in 200 cm³. Wait, 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters, right? Because 1 liter is 1000 cm³.

First, I need to figure out the molarity of each of these compounds. Molarity is moles per liter. So, I'll calculate the moles for each. 

The molecular weight (Mw) of KH2PO4 is given as 136.09 g/mol. So, moles of KH2PO4 = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 136 is approximately 0.00735 moles. Wait, let me be more precise. 136.09 is about 136.09, so 1/136.09 is approximately 0.00735 mol. 

Then, for Na2HPO4·2H2O, the Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles are 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me see, 177.99 is roughly 178. So 1/178 is about 0.005618 mol. 

Now, the solution volume is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations are:
For KH2PO4: 0.00735 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03675 M
For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02809 M

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did the division correctly. Let me recheck. 0.00735 divided by 0.2 is 0.03675? Yes, because 0.2 times 0.03675
