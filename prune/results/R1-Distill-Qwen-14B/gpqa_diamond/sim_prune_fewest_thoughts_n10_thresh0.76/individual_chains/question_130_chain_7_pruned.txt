Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting quasars using ground-based optical telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, wait. So the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. For neutral hydrogen, when they absorb light, they do so at this particular wavelength. But wait, in the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud, the absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. But when the cloud is moving away from us (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength we observe shifts to longer wavelengthsâ€”redshifted.

So the quasar's light passes through this hydrogen cloud, and the cloud absorbs at the observed wavelength. The quasar emits light in various wavelengths, but when the light passes through the hydrogen cloud, some of it gets absorbed. The observed wavelength of that absorption line tells us about the redshift of the cloud.

Now, the problem is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the quasar must emit light that, after being redshifted, is still within the range observable by ground-based optical telescopes.

Wait, but wait. Optical telescopes detect in the visible spectrum, right? Visible light is about 400-7
