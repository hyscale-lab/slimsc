Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's see.

The question starts with compound A, which has two signals in its proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. So a triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. That adds up to 10 protons in total. I'm thinking this might be a di-substituted alkane, maybe like a diethyl group attached to something. Oh wait, diethyl groups. Because each ethyl group has 2 CH2 groups and a CH3. Wait, but ethyl groups have 5 H's each? No, wait, each ethyl group (CH2CH3) has 2 CH3 (each with 3 H) and a CH2 (2 H). So two ethyl groups would give 6 H (from two CH3) and 4 H (from two CH2), which matches the NMR data. So compound A is probably diethyl something. Like diethyl ether? Or maybe diethyl something else.

Wait, diethyl ether has the structure CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The protons adjacent to oxygen would be split differently. But let me think again. The NMR shows a triplet and a quartet. The triplet could be the CH2 groups next to another CH2. Because each CH2 would be next to another CH2, so they split into triplets. And the quartet would be the CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2, which would be a quartet. Wait, no, wait: the splitting depends on neighboring H's.

Wait, for ethyl groups: The CH3 groups (each 3 H) are next to a CH2 with 2 H. So each CH3 would split into a quartet (n+1, where n=2 from CH2). The CH2 groups are next to another CH2, which has 2 H. So the CH2 would be a triplet (n=2). So in diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a quartet, and the CH2 would be a
