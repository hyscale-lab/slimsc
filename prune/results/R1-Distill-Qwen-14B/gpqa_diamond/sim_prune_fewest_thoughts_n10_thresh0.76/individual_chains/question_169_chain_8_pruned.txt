Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about nuclear decay. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's read the question again.

The decay equation is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. Oh wait, and E and V are much lighter particles. So in the original decay, two A nucleons decay into two B, and emit two E and two V particles. And the energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous, with some maximum energy Q.

Now, there's a variant decay where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the equation becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is asking how the E particles' total energy spectrum changes in this new scenario compared to the original.

Let me think about what I remember about particle decays and energy spectra. In beta decay, for example, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves a transition between mass states, and energy is shared between particles.

In the original decay, since E and V are much lighter, their rest mass energies are probably negligible, or at least much smaller than the Q value. But wait, in the first case, two E and two V are emitted. So each E and V might carry away some energy.

In the original scenario, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. That makes sense because in a decay where multiple particles are emitted, each can have a range of energies as long as the total energy and momentum are conserved. For example, in alpha decay, the emitted alpha particles have a discrete energy because the daughter nucleus is in the same state, but if the decay products are different, like in beta decay, the emitted particles have a continuous spectrum.

Wait, in the original problem, E is much lighter. So when E's are emitted, each can take a range of energies, but the total energy is fixed (since Q is the maximum). So the E particles' energies must be less than or equal to Q/2 each, assuming two E's are emitted. But wait, the problem says the E particles have a continuous spectrum. So in the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. Since V is much lighter, maybe their emission also contributes to the energy sharing.

But when the decay changes, instead of two V's, it emits one M. M is massless, so it has negligible rest mass
