Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound using IR and 1H NMR data. Let me start by jotting down the given information and then go through each step.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So that's 5 degrees. That could be one ring and a double bond, or maybe two rings, but more likely one ring and some double bonds. Like a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) and maybe an amide group or something else with a double bond.

The IR shows strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. If it's a secondary amide, the N-H would show up around 3300-3500. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group, like an amide or ester. So maybe it's an amide or an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: That's probably a CH2CH3 group. Like an ethyl group attached to something that deshields it, maybe an oxygen, like an ethyl ester. So ethyl something.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Broad signals can be from N-H, but wait, no, because that's in the 4 ppm region. Or maybe an OCH2 group, but OCH2 would typically be around 3.5-4.0. If it's a singlet, maybe it's next to something that makes splitting difficult, like if it's adjacent to an amide group or another group. Alternatively, maybe an NH2, but in 4 ppm? Or perhaps it's an OCH2 group attached to an electronegative atom.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Maybe that's a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3. Wait, the quartet would be the OCH2CH2 group? Or wait, ethyl ester is OCH2CH3. The ethyl group's CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2 ppm, which matches the 1.20 triplet, 3H. Then the CH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1 or so. But in the data, it's 4.5 ppm, which is a bit high. Maybe it's not an ethyl ester but something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe a methylene group adjacent to another group. Like an acetylamino group or something else.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets each integrating for 2Hâ€”so perhaps two substituents on the benzene, one on each ortho position. Wait, but in a para-substituted ring, you would have two doublets. For example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group like nitro or carbonyl, the protons would be deshielded. Alternatively, maybe an amino group.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene would influence the NMR. Let's think about the coupling. The 7.0 ppm doublet and 8.0 ppm double
