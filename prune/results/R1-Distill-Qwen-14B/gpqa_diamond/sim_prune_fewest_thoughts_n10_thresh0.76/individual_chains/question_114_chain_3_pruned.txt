Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I remember that it's about reaction mechanisms, specifically nucleophilic substitution or maybe some kind of addition reactions. So, I'll think through each step carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, when a ketone reacts with cyanide, what usually happens? Oh right, in the presence of a strong acid, the ketone can undergo a substitution. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution.

Ketones can react with nucleophiles. But usually, that's under certain conditions. Oh, right! The formation of a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is when a nitrile and an alcohol group are added to the carbonyl carbon. So, the reaction is adding CN- as a nucleophile to the carbonyl, and then the oxygen becomes an -OH group.

Wait, but how does the mechanism work? The carbonyl oxygen is attacked by the nucleophile, but in ketones, the carbonyl is less reactive compared to aldehydes. So, perhaps in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh, because the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Wait, but in this case, the product has an OH group. So maybe the mechanism is as follows: the ketone reacts with NaCN (a source of CN-), in the presence of an acid catalyst which helps to stabilize the transition state or the intermediate.

So, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) plus NaCN and an acid (like H3O+) would form the cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure. Butan-2-one has (CH3)2CO, so adding CN and OH groups to the carbonyl carbon would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but wait, 2-h
