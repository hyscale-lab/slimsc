Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what each symmetry means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincaré symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry (like moving the system in space and time without rotation). So if a theory respects Poincaré, it must respect Lorentz too, because Lorentz is part of it.

Wait, but what's the deal with SMEFT respecting these? SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it includes all possible operators that are allowed by the symmetries of the Standard Model. So, the SM has certain symmetries, and SMEFT must preserve those.

I think the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT must as well. But does it require Poincare? Poincare includes translations, which are usually part of the SM. But in SMEFT, when you write down operators, they're local, so they should respect all the SM symmetries, including Poincare. So perhaps operators must respect Poincare, which in turn implies Lorentz.

Wait, the options have 1 and 2 as Lorentz and Poincare. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if Poincare includes Lorentz, then if an operator respects Poincare, it also respects Lorentz. So if an operator must respect Poincare, then you don't need to list Lorentz separately because it's included.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator must respect Poincare, then it must respect Lorentz as a subset. But the options include 1 and 2 as separate. So perhaps the correct approach is to think whether the operators must individually respect each symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps SMEFT allows for operators that break Lorentz symmetry? No, because the SM itself has Lorentz symmetry, so the effective theory must preserve it. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorent
