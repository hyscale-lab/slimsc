Alright, so I've got this problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, okay, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle is a spin-1/2, which probably means they are electrons or something similar, so their spin is 1/2. But wait, spin doesn't affect the energy in this case because the potential doesn't depend on spin. So I can probably ignore the spin for the energy levels.

The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. I need to calculate these in terms of E, where E is given as (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²). So each particle's energy levels are multiples of E. For a single particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are E_n = n² E, where n is the quantum number (n=1,2,3...).

But wait, the problem is about four particles. Oh right, these are fermions because they're spin-1/2. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state in the same system. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin.

In a 1D well, each particle's quantum state is determined by its quantum number n and its spin. Since each particle is spin-1/2, each has two possible spin states: up or down. So, for each n, there can be two particles with different spins.

So when placing four identical particles in the well, I have to arrange them according to the Pauli exclusion principle. The lowest energy state will have the particles filled up starting from the lowest n, each with different spins until we can't add any more without repeating.

Let me think about how to fill these states. The ground state would be the lowest possible energy configuration. So I need to determine how the four particles are distributed among the energy levels, considering the spin.

Starting with the first energy level (n=1). Since each n can hold two particles (with opposite spins), putting two particles here: both have n=1 but with spin up and down. That's two particles accounted for.

Next, we move to n=2. We can add another two particles here, each with spin up and down. Now we've placed four particles. Wait, but that
