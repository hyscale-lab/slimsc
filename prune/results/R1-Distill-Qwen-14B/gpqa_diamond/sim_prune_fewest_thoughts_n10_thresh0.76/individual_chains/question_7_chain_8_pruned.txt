Okay, so I've got this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process γγ → e+e-. So, the lifetime is determined by this annihilation process. Oh right, because if a gamma-ray is too high energy, it can annihilate with CMB photons, so their number would decrease over time due to this interaction.

I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is determined by the interaction rate. The interaction rate would depend on the cross-section and the density of the target photons, which in this case are the CMB photons.

The formula I think is something like τ ≈ 1/Γ, where Γ is the interaction rate. And Γ would be σ * n * v, where σ is the cross-section, n is the number density of target photons, and v is the relative velocity.

Wait, but for high-energy gamma-rays, the cross-section for pair production (γγ→e+e-) depends on the energy. The cross-section σ is proportional to some function of the gamma energy. I recall that the cross-section for this process peaks at certain energies. Maybe it's something like σ ~ 1/E^2 or another dependence.

Wait, I think the cross-section for γγ → e+e- has a threshold. The process can only happen if the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron mass. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so each photon needs to have energy above that when considering two of them. But wait, in our case, the CMB photons are much lower energy, so the gamma-ray must have sufficient energy to meet the threshold when colliding with a CMB photon.

The average energy of the CMB photons is given as 1e-3 eV. So, for the process to happen, the sum of the two photon energies must be at least 2 * m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So, the gamma-ray's energy E must satisfy E + E_cmbr >= 1.022 MeV. Since E_cmbr is about 1e-3 eV, which is much smaller, the condition is approximately E >= 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's just
