Okay, let's try to solve this problem. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through step by step.

So the question is about some chemical reactions and mixtures. Let me break down the information given.

First, we have mixture X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine usually means they have double bonds, like alkenes or maybe something with more unsaturation. Alkenes can add bromine and cause the solution to decolorize because they react.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids, which result from a disproportionation reaction. Wait, what's a disproportionation reaction? Oh right, that's when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. Like when H2O2 breaks down into H2O and O2, I think.

Importantly, mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water. So whatever the products are, they don't have any double bonds, maybe? But wait, maybe they have something else that doesn't react with bromine. Or perhaps the original compounds were something else that, after reaction, lose the ability to decolorize.

Next, the hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Wait, let me calculate what that means. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, so the rest is carbon. 14.28% is approximately 1/7, so maybe the formula is C_nH_m where H is 1/7 of the molecular mass.

Wait, mass fraction H is 14.28% which is 0.1428. So if molecular weight is M, then (m*1)/(M) = 0.1428. M = (m)/(0.1428). Also, the molecular formula must satisfy the hydrocarbon, so M = 12n + m, where n is the number of carbon atoms and m is the number of H.

Let me think: For example, if Z is ethane (C2H6), then H is 6/(28
