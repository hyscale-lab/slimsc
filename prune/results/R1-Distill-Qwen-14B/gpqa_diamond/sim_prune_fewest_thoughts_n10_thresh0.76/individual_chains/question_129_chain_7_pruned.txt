Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through compounds B, C, D to E. We're supposed to identify compound E based on the given information and the options provided.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction step and the hints given.

First, the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

So, each step transforms the compound, and I need to track the structural changes.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Let me think about what these IR peaks indicate. A peak around 1750 usually suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. But since A is reacting with HCN, which typically adds to carbonyls, A might be a ketone. Then, E's peak at 1715 cm^-1 could also be a carbonyl, maybe a ketone again but possibly a different environment.

Now, looking at hint a: the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A is a ketone, reacting with a ylide would form an alkene.

Wait, but the product in hint a is a cyclopentane with substituents. The substituents are 1,2-dimethyl and a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4. Hmm. The propan-2-ylidene is a methylene group attached to a methyl group, I think. So that's like a CH2-C(CH3)2 group attached as a substituent.

Wait, the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is the ylid part, so it's like CH2-C(CH3)=. So maybe the cyclopentane has a double bond formed by the Wittig reaction.

So, the starting material A, when treated with a Wittig reagent, forms an alkene. That suggests that A must have a carbonyl group (since the Wittig reaction adds an alkene to carbonyls). So A is a ketone, as the IR peak at 1750 supports.

So, when A is a ketone, it reacts with HCN (which is a nucleophilic addition) to form compound B, which is likely a cyanohydrin. Then, compound B is hydrogenated (with H2 and Pd), which probably reduces the nitrile group to an amine, but wait, no. Wait, H2 with Pd is typically for hydrogenation of triple bonds or for reduction of nitriles? Wait, nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, maybe it's a different condition. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of Pd, it's a hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond.

Wait, let's think. Compound B is from A + HCN. A is a ketone; adding HCN would typically form a cyanohydrin. So, for example, ketone + HCN â†’ cyanohydrin (a compound with an adjacent alcohol and nitr
