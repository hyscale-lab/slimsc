Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there's a planet, let's call it Planet A, with Earth's radius, orbiting a star. The star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the orbital period is 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet, Planet B, which is biggerâ€”2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still showing both transit and occultation events.

Hmm. Both transit and occultation events. So, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet is hidden in the star's glare. For both to happen, the orbital plane must be edge-on enough so that the planet's orbit is inclined such that it transits and occultates.

Wait, but the planets are in the same orbital plane, so their orbits are aligned in the same plane. So, the question is about their orbital periods and the geometry of their orbits around the same star.

I remember that for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be edge-on enough relative to our line of sight. The impact parameter is the measure of how close to the center the planet passes when transiting. Impact parameter b is given by (a sin i) / R_star, where a is the orbital radius, i is the inclination angle (90 degrees is edge-on), and R_star is the star's radius.

But wait, in this problem, we have two planets. Both are around the same star, same orbital plane. So their orbital planes are the same, meaning they have the same inclination. So, if Planet A transits, then Planet B must also transit because it's in the same plane. But why is the question about maximum orbital period?

Wait, the question asks for the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that it exhibits both transit and occultation. Hmm. Wait, occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, right? So for that to be visible, the planet must be larger than the star? No, wait, occultation is when the planet is behind the star from our point of view. So the planet is hidden, so the dip
