Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, the options are A through D, and I have to choose the right one.

Wait, I should start by recalling what the partition function is. The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the system of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So, each state contributes a term based on its energy.

The system has three spins, each with two possible states: +1 and -1. So the total number of possible states is 2^3 =8. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3.

I think I should list all possible states and calculate their energies. Then, for each energy, count how many states have that energy. That way, I can group the terms in the partition function.

Let me list all 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, compute the energy E.

The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ). So let's compute each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3.

Let's compute each state:

1. All +1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -J *3 = -3J.
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. E= J.
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1-1+1 = -1. E= J.
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1-1+1 =-1. E= J.
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. E= J.
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 =-1. E= J.
8. All -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -J*3= -3J.

Wait, let me double-check that. For state 8, all spins are -1. So each product S1S2 is (-1)(-1)=1, same for S1S3 and S2S3. So sum is 3. So E is -3J.

So looking at all the energies, states 1 and 8 have E=-3J. The other six states (2-7) have E=J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E). Let's compute each term.

For states 1 and 8: exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J). Each contributes this. So their total contribution is 2 * exp(3 β J).

For states 2 through 7: each has E= J. So exp(-β J). Since there are 6 states, their contribution is 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the energy is E = -J [sum], so E = -J*(something). For the states 2-7, the sum inside was -1, so E = -J*(-1) = J. So yes.

Wait, but in the partition function, it's exp(-β E). So for E= J, it's exp(-β J). And for E= -3J, it's exp(3 β J).

So Z = 2 exp(3 β J) + 6 exp(-β J). Hmm. Now looking at the options:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ}. No, because the first term is negative exponent.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3
