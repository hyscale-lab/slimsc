Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

Alright, the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But when they measured the positions, all the particles were between x=1 and x=3. So, our job is to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function needs to be normalized. Normalization means that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. The integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but the wave function here is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh, wait, that's a complex function. So the wave function ψ(x) is a complex number. The absolute square is ψ*(x) ψ(x), where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

So, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i.

The absolute square is then [a / sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2. Because when you multiply out the terms, the cross terms (like (a/sqrt(1+x))*0.5i and similar) would involve imaginary numbers and cancel out when multiplied by their conjugates. So, the absolute square is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25).

But wait, wait. Let me double-check that. If ψ is A + Bi, then ψ* is A - Bi. So, ψ*ψ is (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B². Oh, wait, that's correct. So yeah, the absolute square is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25).

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 +x )) - 0.5i. So the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when you take the absolute square, the imaginary part squared is (0.5)^2, which is 0.25, right?

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, wait. The normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 equals 1, because the particle can't be found outside that interval.

Wait, but wait again. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, how is this possible? Because normally, for a wave function, the square of the absolute value must be real and positive. But in this case, it's adding the squares of the real and imaginary parts, which I think is correct.

But wait, another thought. If the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and that's valid only between x=1 and x=3, then the normalization integral is from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

Let me write that down as an equation:

Integral (from 1 to 3) [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

We can split this integral into two parts: Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] + Integral [0.25 dx], both from 1 to 3.

Calculating each part:
