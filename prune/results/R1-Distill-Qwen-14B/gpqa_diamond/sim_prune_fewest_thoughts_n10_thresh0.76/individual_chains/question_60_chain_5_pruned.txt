Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation. Oh right, that's from Einstein's theory of relativity. 

Alright, so the scenario is an alien civilization from the Large Magellanic Cloud sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft is going super fast—0.99999987 times the speed of light. Wow, that's almost the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years, which is way longer than humans. But the astronaut is 22 years old, so they're young.

The question is asking how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective. So, the astronaut's own experienced time, which in relativity terms is the proper time. Because when you're moving at such a high speed, time dilation occurs. From Earth's perspective, the astronaut's time would be dilated, but from the astronaut's frame, the Earth is moving towards them, so the distance is contracted.

Wait, but wait. The spacecraft is going at a high speed towards Earth, so from Earth's frame, the distance is about the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. I think the distance between the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. But the exact distance might not matter here because the question is from the astronaut's point of view.

Wait, no. The problem says to calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective. So, in their frame of reference, the distance to Earth is contracted. So, the distance is less than what Earth observers would see.

The formula for time in special relativity is different depending on whose frame you're in. So, for the astronaut, the time experienced (tau) is the proper time, which is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but wait, no—that's when t is the time in the Earth frame. Or perhaps, more accurately, the proper time tau is the time experienced by the traveler, which would be less than the time experienced by someone on Earth.

Wait, let's get the formula right. The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time. The proper time is given by tau = t * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), where t is the time measured in the Earth frame. Alternatively,
