Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. Hmm, I need to find the energy spectrum. Let me try to think this through.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, so it's a function of both r and θ, which probably means it's in polar coordinates. But in quantum mechanics, sometimes it's easier to work in Cartesian coordinates, especially when dealing with separation of variables.

Wait, another thought: when you have a potential that depends on r and θ, maybe it can be written in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Let me think about that. So r is sqrt(x² + y²), right? And cosθ is x/r, so cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ would be (x²)/(r²). Hmm.

Putting that into the potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²). Simplify that, the r² cancels out in the second term. So the second term becomes (3/2)k x². So now the potential is (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k x². Wait, that can be rewritten as (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Combine like terms: x² (1/2 k + 3/2 k) = 2k x². So overall, V = (1/2 k)(x² + y²) + (3/2 k)(x²) = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) = (2k x² + 1/2 k y²).

Wait, let me double-check that. So (1/2)k r² is (1/2 k)(x² + y²). The second term is (3/2)k x². So when you add them, it's (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y²) ) = (2k x²) + (1/
