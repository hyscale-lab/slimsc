Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ=10^-17 degrees, and it's at a distance d=10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are A) 1e62, B) 1e59, C) 1e66, D) 1e65.

Wait, entropy of a black hole—right, I remember that the entropy is related to the area of the event horizon. The formula, I think, is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area and the constants are Planck's, gravitational, and Boltzmann's. But I might get the exact formula wrong, but I remember the area is involved.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, probably using the angular size and the distance. The angular size θ is given in degrees, which I should convert to radians because the formula for the angular size is θ ≈ r/d, where r is the size and d is the distance, but only when θ is small, which it is here (1e-17 degrees is tiny).

Wait, let me get the units right. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d is 1e10 parsecs. That's d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

The angular size is θ in radians. Since θ is in degrees, I can convert it by multiplying by π/180. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π/180. Let's compute that.

1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (π/180) radians. Let's compute that:

1e-17 * π ≈ 3.14e-17, divided by 180 is approximately 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, the relation θ ≈ r/d. So r ≈ θ * d.

So r ≈ 1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m.

Multiply those: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.745 * 3.086) * 1e7.

1.745 * 3.086 ≈ let's see, 1.7 *3 is 5.1, 0.045*3 is ~0.135, 1.7*0.086 is ~0.146, 0.045 *0.086 is small. Adding up roughly 5.1 + 0.135 + 0.146 ≈ 5.38. So about 5.38e7 meters.

Wait, 1e7 meters is 10^7 meters, which is 10 kilometers. So the radius is about 5.38e7 meters, which is 5.38e4 kilometers, or about 53,800 km. That's the Schwarzschild radius, right? So the Schwarzschild radius R_s is 2GM/c². But maybe I don't need that since I've got r, which is the event horizon radius.

Wait, but for a black hole, the event horizon radius is R = R_s/2? No, no, wait. The Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c², and the event horizon is at R_s/2? Wait no, no—the event horizon is at R_s. Wait, no, wait: the Schwarzschild radius is the radius defining the event horizon. So R = R_s = 2GM/c². So in this case, r is the Schwarzschild radius.

Wait, but in our calculation, we found r ≈5.38e7 meters, which is the Schwarzschild radius. So the area A is 4πr².

Calculating area: A = 4 * π * (5.38e7 m)^2.

Let's compute that. 5.38e7 squared is (5.38)^2 * 1e14. 5.38 squared is approximately 28.94. So 28.94e14 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * π ≈12.566. So 12.56
