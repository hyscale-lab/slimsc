Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options are given, so I need to determine which option correctly matches the products A and B.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (t-BuOK) → A.

Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So this is probably an enolate formation reaction. The starting material is a ketone. When a ketone is treated with a strong base, it forms an enolate ion, which can then react with an electrophilic reagent like ethyl acrylate.

Looking at the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl is at position 1. The substituents are ethyl at position 2 and methyl groups at 2 and 6. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The structure is 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl—wait, no, the numbering. The compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1, and the ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. At position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group? Wait, no, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl—so position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group? Or perhaps position 2 is ethyl, and position 6 is methyl. Wait, no. Let me draw the structure.

Cyclohexanone ring with carbonyl at position 1. So the ring is numbered 1 (carbonyl), then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The substituents are ethyl at position 2 and methyl at positions 2 and 6. Wait, no. The name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl substituent? Or position 2 has an ethyl, and position 6 has a methyl? Because 2,6-dimethyl means two methyl groups at positions 2 and 6. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl, making it a substituent with two groups. That would make the structure at position 2: ethyl and methyl, so in total, maybe it's a substituent like CH(CH2CH3)CH3? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents are at position 2: ethyl
