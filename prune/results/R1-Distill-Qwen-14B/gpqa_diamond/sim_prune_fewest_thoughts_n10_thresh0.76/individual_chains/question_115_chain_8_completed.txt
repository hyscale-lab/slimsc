Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along a horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. Right, so first, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and positron are involved, their rest mass energy is converted into the energy of the photons. But wait, they're moving, so their kinetic energy plus rest mass energy will contribute to the photons' energy.

Wait, the Lorentz factor (γ) is given for both. The Lorentz factor is gamma, which is total energy divided by rest mass energy. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so the total energy for each particle would be γ multiplied by that rest mass.

So, the electron has γ=4, so its energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV. The positron has γ=2, so 2 * 0.511 MeV. But wait, are the energies additive? Because they're moving towards each other, I think their momenta would be opposite in direction.

But since they annihilate, the total energy is the sum of their energies, and the total momentum would be the sum of their momenta (considering direction).

Wait, but in the rest frame, the total momentum should be zero because for annihilation, the system's total momentum is conserved. So maybe we need to consider the center of momentum frame, or perhaps use conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame.

Wait, the lab frame is probably not the center of mass frame because the electron and positron have different Lorentz factors and are moving towards each other. So the total momentum isn't zero.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, the photons must carry away energy and momentum such that the total energy and momentum are conserved. So I need to calculate the total energy and total momentum before annihilation, then see how the photons' energies and directions relate to that.

So, let's break it down. Let's model this in one dimension first, then think about the photon directions.

Wait, but the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. Oh, so they're not along the same line. That suggests that after annihilation, the photons are emitted at some angle relative to the original direction. So the system's momentum before annihilation includes both the momentum from the electron and positron. The photons must carry this momentum, but also their energies must add up to the total energy.

Wait, but the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So each photon has energy E1 = E2 = E_photon. And their directions are such that one is upper-right, another lower-right. So they could be symmetric above and below the horizontal axis.

Wait, but the question is to find the angle between the two photons. So if one is at +θ above the horizontal, the other is at -θ below. The angle between them would be 2θ. Alternatively, if they are in different quadrants, but the way the problem states it, both are moving to the right, so both have positive x-components of momentum.

Wait, but the initial particles are moving along the horizontal axis. So perhaps the photons are emitted in directions perpendicular to that? Or at some angle θ above and below the horizontal.

Wait, but the electrons are moving in opposite directions. So for the collision, the electron is moving from left to right, and the positron from right to left. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Let me think about the momentum and energy before annihilation.

Electron's momentum: p_e = γ_e * m_e * v_e. Wait, but v_e can be found from γ. Alternatively, since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), but maybe it's easier to express in terms of relativistic momentum.

Wait, the relativistic momentum p is given by p = γ m v. And since γ = E/(m c²), E = γ m c². Alternatively, in units where c=1, E = γ m, and p = γ m v. So perhaps I can compute the momentum in terms of gamma.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate in natural units where c=1. So the rest mass energy is m_e c² = 0.511 MeV, but with c=1, m_e is 0.511 MeV.

Wait, but perhaps I can proceed in terms of momentum and energy.

The electron's energy is E_e = γ_e * m_e c² = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.

Similarly, the positron's energy is E_p = γ_p * m_e c² = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

Now, their momenta: for the electron moving from left to right, its momentum is positive. The positron is moving from right to left, so its momentum is negative. Wait, but since they are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify: the electron is moving to the right (from left), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from right), so its momentum is negative. So yes, their momenta are in opposite directions.

Calculating their momenta:

p_e = γ_e * m_e * v_e.

But v_e can be found from γ_e. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me compute v_e and v_p.

Alternatively, for the momentum, p = γ m v. Also, since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So maybe it's easier to compute p from E.

Wait, for the electron:

E_e = 4 m_e c². So,

p_e c = sqrt( E_e^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (4 m_e c²)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) = sqrt(16 m_e^2 c^4 - m_e^2 c^4 ) = sqrt(15 m_e^2 c^4 ) = m_e c² sqrt(15).

So p_e = (m_e c² sqrt(15)) / c^2 ) = m_e sqrt(15) / c.

Wait, actually, let's get the units right. Let me think in terms of m_e c² as the unit of energy.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute p in terms of m_e.

p_e = sqrt( E_e^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c.

Wait, E_e = 4 m_e c².

So,

p_e = sqrt( (4 m_e c²)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) / c = sqrt(16 m_e² c^4 - m_e² c^4 ) / c = sqrt(15 m_e² c^4 ) / c = m_e c² sqrt(15) / c = m_e c sqrt(15).

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Let me think again. The relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So, solving for pc:

pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 )

So, p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c² ?

Wait, no, E is in units of energy. Let me compute p for the electron.

E_e = 4 m_e c².

So,

(p_e c)^2 = (4 m_e c²)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 = (16 -1) m_e² c^4 = 15 m_e² c^4.

So,

p_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c²,

so,

p_e = sqrt(15) m_e c.

Wait, units: if m_e is in kg, c in m/s, then p_e is kg m/s, which is correct.

Similarly, for the positron: γ_p = 2.

E_p = 2 m_e c².

p_p c = sqrt( (2 m_e c²)^2 - (m_e c²)^2 ) = sqrt(4 m_e² c^4 - m_e² c^4 ) = sqrt(3) m_e c².

So p_p = sqrt(3) m_e c.

But wait, the positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum before collision is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative): p_total = p_e - p_p = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c.

Wait, but wait, in the electron's case, p_e is positive, and the positron's p_p is negative because it's moving opposite. So the total momentum is p_total = p_e - p_p.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The electron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is negative. So the total momentum is p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.

Wait, so p_p is in the opposite direction, so in terms of magnitude, the electron's p is +sqrt(15) m_e c, positron's p is -sqrt(3) m_e c.

So total momentum: p_total = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Wait, but wait: let me compute the numbers.

sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14.

So p_total is about 2.14 m_e c.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the signs yet. Let's just proceed with the algebra.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies. Let me denote their energies as E_photon each. Each photon has energy E_photon, and they have momenta p_photon = E_photon / c, since for photons, E = pc.

Wait, because for photons, E = pc. So each photon's momentum is E_photon / c.

But the directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So their momentum vectors are symmetrical with respect to the x-axis.

Let me model the problem in two dimensions. The initial total momentum is along the x-axis (since the particles were moving along the horizontal axis). After annihilation, the photons have momentum vectors in the x-y plane.

So, each photon has momentum components: p_x and p_y.

Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their y-components are opposite in sign. Let's say photon 1 has +p_y and photon 2 has -p_y. But both have positive p_x because they are moving to the right.

So, the momentum of photon 1 is (p_x1, p_y1), and photon 2 is (p_x2, p_y2), with p_y2 = -p_y1.

Since the energies are the same, E_photon = E1 = E2.

But since for photons, E = |p| c. So, the magnitude of each photon's momentum is E_photon / c.

Wait, but the momentum vector of a photon is in the direction of its propagation. So for photon 1, its momentum components are p_x1 = E_photon cosθ / c, p_y1 = E_photon sinθ / c. Similarly, photon 2 has p_x2 = E_photon cosθ / c, p_y2 = -E_photon sinθ / c.

Wait, but I think I have to consider that θ is the angle each photon makes with the x-axis. So for photon 1, it's angle θ above x-axis, photon 2 is angle θ below x-axis.

So, their momentum vectors are:

Photon 1: (E_photon cosθ / c, E_photon sinθ / c )

Photon 2: (E_photon cosθ / c, -E_photon sinθ / c )

Because their magnitudes are same, and they're symmetric.

Now, the total momentum after annihilation is the vector sum of the two photons' momenta.

So, the sum in the x-direction:

p_x_total = (E_photon cosθ / c ) + (E_photon cosθ / c ) = 2 E_photon cosθ / c.

In the y-direction:

p_y_total = (E_photon sinθ / c ) + ( - E_photon sinθ / c ) = 0.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is (2 E_photon cosθ / c, 0).

But momentum must be conserved from before to after. So the initial total momentum is along x, which is (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c, as computed earlier.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is 2 E_photon cosθ / c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Therefore,

2 E_photon cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c².

Because: 2 E_photon cosθ / c = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c → multiply both sides by c:

2 E_photon cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c².

But wait, E_photon is in units of energy. Let me think about the units. m_e c² is 0.511 MeV.

So, let's compute the right-hand side: (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * m_e c².

sqrt(15) ≈ 3.872, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732. So sqrt(15)-sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14. So 2.14 * 0.511 MeV ≈ 1.092 MeV.

So, 2 E_photon cosθ = 1.092 MeV.

But I also need to consider the energy conservation.

The total energy before annihilation is E_e + E_p = 4 * 0.511 MeV + 2 * 0.511 MeV = (4 + 2) * 0.511 = 6 * 0.511 ≈ 3.066 MeV.

After annihilation, the total energy is 2 E_photon, since each photon has energy E_photon.

So, 2 E_photon = 3.066 MeV → E_photon = 3.066 / 2 ≈ 1.533 MeV.

Wait, but wait a minute. Are the photons' energies the sum of the rest mass energies and the kinetic energies of the electron and positron? Or is it the total energy, including their rest mass and kinetic energies?

Yes, because the total energy before annihilation is the sum of their energies, which includes rest mass and kinetic. So the photons must carry away this total energy.

So E_photon = (E_e + E_p) / 2 = (4 * 0.511 MeV + 2 * 0.511 MeV)/2 = (6 * 0.511 MeV)/2 = 3 * 0.511 MeV = 1.533 MeV.

So, E_photon is 1.533 MeV.

Now, going back to the momentum equation:

2 E_photon cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c².

We can plug in E_photon = (3 * 0.511) MeV, m_e c² = 0.511 MeV.

So,

2 * (3 * 0.511) MeV * cosθ = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 MeV.

Let's compute both sides.

Left side: 6 * 0.511 MeV * cosθ.

Right side: (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) * 0.511 MeV ≈ (3.872 - 1.732) * 0.511 ≈ 2.14 * 0.511 ≈ 1.092 MeV.

So, 6 * 0.511 * cosθ = 1.092 → 3.066 cosθ = 1.092 → cosθ = 1.092 / 3.066 ≈ 0.356.

So θ ≈ arccos(0.356). Let me calculate that.

Well, arccos(0.356) is approximately 69 degrees (since cos(60) is 0.5, cos(90) is 0). Let's check:

cos(60) = 0.5 → 60 degrees.

Looking for cos(theta)=0.356. Let's see, 69 degrees: cos(69) ≈ 0.358. Close enough.

So theta is approximately 69 degrees. So each photon is at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.

But the question is about the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +69 degrees and the other at -69 degrees, the angle between them is 69 * 2 = 138 degrees.

Looking at the options: option C is 138.

Wait, but did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial momentum of the positron: since it's moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So when I calculated p_total, it was p_e (positive) minus p_p (because p_p was negative, so subtracted). So the total momentum was (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Wait, but I think another approach would be to use the center of momentum frame. But perhaps the way I did it is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the total momentum is (p_e - p_p), because the positron's momentum is opposite.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the direction of the photons more carefully.

Wait, another approach: since the photons have the same energy and their directions are symmetric in the y-axis, their y-components cancel, and the x-components add up. So the total momentum after annihilation is 2 E_photon cosθ / c.

Which must equal the total initial momentum, which is (p_e - p_p) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) m_e c.

So yes, that's correct.

And the energy conservation gave E_photon = 3 * 0.511 MeV.

So, the calculation seems right. So theta is about 69 degrees, so the angle between the photons is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138. So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron move along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors γ_e = 4 and γ_p = 2, respectively. Their rest mass energy is \( m_e c^2 = 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Step 1: Total Energy Before Annihilation
The total energy of the system before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_e + E_p = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4(0.511) + 2(0.511) = 6.132 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Total Momentum Before Annihilation
The relativistic momentum of a particle is given by:
\[
p = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - (m_e c^2)^2}}{c}.
\]
For the electron (\( \gamma_e = 4 \)):
\[
p_e = \frac{\sqrt{(4 \cdot 0.511)^2 - (0.511)^2}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{16(0.511)^2 - (0.511)^2}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{15}(0.511)}{c}.
\]
For the positron (\( \gamma_p = 2 \)):
\[
p_p = \frac{\sqrt{(2 \cdot 0.511)^2 - (0.511)^2}}{c} = \frac{\sqrt{3}(0.511)}{c}.
\]
Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. The total momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_e - p_p = \sqrt{15}(0.511) - \sqrt{3}(0.511) = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})(0.511).
\]
Approximating \( \sqrt{15} \approx 3.872 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
\[
p_{\text{total}} \approx (3.872 - 1.732)(0.511) \approx 2.140 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Step 3: Energy and Momentum After Annihilation
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energies \( E_{\text{photon}} \). The total energy after annihilation is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = 2 E_{\text{photon}}.
\]
From energy conservation:
\[
2 E_{\text{photon}} = 6.132 \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3.066 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Each photon has momentum \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3.066}{c} \). The photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the horizontal axis, making angles \( \theta \) with the horizontal. Their momentum components are:
\[
p_{x1} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{y1} = p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta,
\]
\[
p_{x2} = p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, \quad p_{y2} = -p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta.
\]
The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{total}} = p_{x1} + p_{x2} = 2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta.
\]
From momentum conservation:
\[
2 p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})(0.511).
\]
Substituting \( p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{3.066}{c} \):
\[
2 \cdot \frac{3.066}{c} \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3})(0.511).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
6.132 \cos\theta = 1.092 \implies \cos\theta = \frac{1.092}{6.132} \approx 0.178.
\]
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.178) \approx 80^\circ.
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
The photons are emitted symmetrically above and below the horizontal axis, so the angle between them is:
\[
2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 80^\circ = 160^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is approximately **160°**, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
