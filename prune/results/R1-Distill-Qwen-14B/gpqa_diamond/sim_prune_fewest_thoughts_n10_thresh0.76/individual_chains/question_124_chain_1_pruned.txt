Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let's see. So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. The new particles produced are fast-decaying, and they move at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Oh right, the Lorentz factor is gamma, which is like the factor that tells you how much time dilation or length contraction is happening.

The question says that on average, one third of these particles reaches the detector's inner walls. So, the detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the walls. So, we need to find a new gamma value that makes the fraction of particles reaching the walls increase from 1/3 to 2/3.

Wait, what determines whether a particle reaches the detector walls? I think it has to do with the time it takes for the particle to decay versus the time it takes to travel the radius of the detector. If the particle decays before it can reach the wall, it won't be detected. So, the probability that a particle is detected is related to the ratio of the proper lifetime of the particle (as measured in its rest frame) to the time it experiences due to its velocity (dilated time).

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. The lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So, if the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to travel the radius of the detector, then it has a higher chance of reaching the wall.

Alternatively, the fraction that reaches the wall is given by the ratio of the mean lifetime of the particle (as observed in the lab frame) divided by the time it takes to reach the wall. So, if the lifetime is much longer than the travel time, most particles reach the wall. If the lifetime is shorter than the travel time, few do.

Wait, no, actually, for a fast-decaying particle, the proper lifetime tau is very short. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance (radius) divided by the speed. Since the speed is ultra-relativistic, it's approximately c.

So, the time to reach the wall is t = R/(beta c), where beta is v/c. Wait, beta is v/c, so for R = 30 meters, t = 30/(beta c). Hmm, but c is about 3e8 m/s, so beta is approximately 1 for relativistic speeds. So, t â‰ˆ 30/(1 * 3e8) = 1e-7 seconds? That seems really short. But the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau. So, if gamma * tau > t, then the particle has a higher chance of decaying after traveling the distance, meaning it reaches the wall.

Wait, but the fraction that reaches the wall is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than t. Since the decay is exponential, the probability P that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, maybe. Let me think about the exponential decay formula. The
