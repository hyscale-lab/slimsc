Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ plus the square root of 3 over 2 times |↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. So I need to compute <ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ> and find the value.

First, I think I need to break this down. The expectation value of an operator is the sum of the expectation values of each term if the operator is a sum. So I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ and 5⟨σx⟩.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value for σz is straightforward. The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me compute the coefficients. The probability of being in |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and for |↓⟩ it's |√3/2|^2 which is (3/4) = 0.75. 

Wait, σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right? So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5. But wait, maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, since the state is a linear combination, ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the squares of the coefficients multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So 0.5^2 *1 + (√3/2)^2 * (-1) → 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) → yes, same result. So that part is correct.

Next, σx. σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are different. Wait, σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation value directly without knowing the eigenstates.

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute ⟨σx⟩, I need to find ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0] and |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ is 0.5 * [1;0] + (√3/2) * [0;1] → [0.5; √3/2].

So ψ is [0.5, √3/2]^T. Now, σx is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So σx|ψ⟩ would be [ (√3/2), 0.5 ]^T. Because σx swaps the two components. So to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, it's the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by σx |ψ⟩.

Wait, ψ is [0.5, √3/2], and σx |ψ⟩ is [√3/2, 0.5], because σx applied to [a; b] gives [b; a]. So the inner product is (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) → which is 2*(0.5)(√3/2) = 2*(√3/4) )= √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it step by step. ⟨ψ| is [0.5*, (√3/2)*]. Since the coefficients are real here, it's [0.5, √3/2]. So when I multiply by σx |ψ⟩, which is [√3/2, 0.5], I get (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) → 0.5*(√3/2) is (√3)/4, and the second term is the same, so total is (√3)/4 + (√3)/4 = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866. So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Now, adding the two parts together: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ = (-5) +4.33= -0.67.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations. Because maybe I made a mistake in the expectation value of σx. Another approach is to use the general formula for expectation value.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the state ψ as a vector and compute the expectation value using ψ† σx ψ.

ψ is [0.5, √3/2]^T. ψ† is [0.5, √3/2]. σx is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So ψ† σx is [√3/2, 0.5]. Then multiply by ψ: [√3/2 * 0.5] + [0.5 * (√3/2)] → same as before, 2*(√3/
