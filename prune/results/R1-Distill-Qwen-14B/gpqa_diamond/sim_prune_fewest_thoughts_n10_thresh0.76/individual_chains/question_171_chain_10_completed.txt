Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question lists six substances, all substituted benzene rings, and says they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. Only one monobromo derivative is formed. Then I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order.

Hmm. So each of these compounds has a substituent on the benzene ring. The substituent will direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to either the ortho, meta, or para positions. Also, the activating or deactivating nature of the substituent will affect the reactivity, but since the question is about the position (para) rather than the amount produced, maybe the directing effect is more important here.

Wait, but it's about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So if a substituent strongly directs the incoming group to the para position, then the para product will be more, right? But some substituents could deactivate the ring, making the reaction slower, but in the presence of excess bromine, perhaps steric factors or other effects take place.

Wait, but the question is about the amount of para product. So substituents that are strong meta directors would lead to less para product, and those that are strong para directors would lead to more. But wait, para directors are generally activating groups, which are ortho/para directors. So the substituent's directing effects determine the product distribution.

But wait, in this case, each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. If only one product is formed, that suggests that the substituent is either strongly directing or perhaps the reaction is under conditions where only one position is favored. For example, if the substituent is a strong deactivating group, it might deactivate most positions except one, or perhaps the substituent is such that only one position is possible due to symmetry.

Wait, no, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." So each of these reactions leads to a single product. That suggests that regardless of the substituent, the bromine adds in a specific position. So the substituents must be such that they direct to only one possible position, maybe due to their directing effects or steric hindrance.

Wait, but that's not possible for all substituents. For example, some substituents allow for multiple positions but in this case, only one is formed. So perhaps because of the substituent's strong directing effect, the majority of the product is in one position, and the others are negligible. Or perhaps the substituent is such that bromination occurs in only one position, like in the case of a substituent that makes the ring so activated in one position that all bromine adds there.

Wait, but when the substituent is strongly activating, the ring is more reactive, but the directing effect determines where the substitution occurs. Let's list the substituents and their effects:

1) С6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group, ortho/para director. So bromine can add to ortho, para positions. But since we have excess bromine, maybe it's not about the product's position but the reaction conditions? Wait, but the question says only one product is formed. That's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent leads to a single major product but not necessarily 100% para. But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So some substituents lead to more para, others less.

Wait, but if the substituent is a strong meta director, then para wouldn't be major. But if it's an ortho/para director, para would be a major product. Also, some substituents are deactivating but meta directors, so they don't allow para substitution much. So let me list each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl is activating (ortho/para director).
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: ester group, like COOEt. The carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, so this is a deactivating group. It's a meta director.
3) C6H5-Cl: chloride is deactivating (due to -I effect), but it's an ortho/para director. Because Cl has lone pairs which can donate some electrons via resonance, but the inductive effect is stronger, making it deactivating. So it's o/p director but deactivating.
4) C6H5-NO2: nitro group is strong deactivating (meta) director. So it will direct to meta positions.
5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's activating, so o/p director.
6) C6H5-COOH: carboxylic acid group. That's deactivating, strong. It's a meta director because it's an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, but the substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity and the direction of the incoming electrophile is crucial. So for each substituent, the product's para position will depend on whether the substituent is o/p or meta, and the substituent's strength.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So if a substituent is a strong o/p director, the para product will form more. If it's a meta director, the para product will be less.

But wait, some substituents are more strongly activating, so they direct the electrophile more strongly to certain positions. For example, a strong activating group like -OCH3 would direct strongly to para, leading to a higher fraction there.

But in this case, substituents 1, 3,5 are activating (methyl, chloro, ethyl?), wait no. Wait, Cl is deactivating. Wait, no:

Wait, methyl is activating (ortho/para), Cl is deactivating but ortho/para (due to -I but +M, but the overall is deactivating, so meta would be less likely?), wait no. Wait, nitro is definitely meta, Cl is ortho/para but deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, but the substituent directs to ortho and para.

So for each substituent, the para product would be more likely if the substituent is an o/p director, and less if it's meta.

But wait, the para product's weight fraction is determined by how much the substituent directs to para. So let's think about each substituent:

1) Methyl (activating, o/p): So Br adds in ortho and para positions, with para being major. So the para product would be major.

2) COOEt (ester group, deactivating, meta): Br adds in meta. So para is not formed. So the para fraction is zero? Or wait, the substituent is in a certain position. Wait, the question says, when bromine is added, the substituent directs to where? So if the substituent is in position 1, and the incoming Br can go to 2,3,4,5,6. If the substituent is a meta director, then Br would go to position 4 (para to substituent), but wait, no. Wait, no, the substituent is in position 1. If it's a meta director, the Br would go to positions 3 and 5 (meta to substituent). So the para position is position 4, but only if the substituent is o/p director. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions.

Wait, maybe I should draw a benzene ring. Let's imagine substituent X is attached at position 1. If X is an ortho/para director, then Br can go to positions 2 (ortho), 4 (para), or 6 (another ortho). So the para is position 4. If X is a meta director, Br would go to 3 and 5 (meta positions). So in that case, the para product (position 4) would not be formed, because the substituent is meta-directing.

Wait, but wait, the substituent's position is fixed, so the incoming Br can go to specific positions relative to it. So in the case of a meta director substituent, the Br will add in the meta position, which is positions 3 and 5. So if the substituent is at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. So the para position relative to substituent 1 is position 4, which is not a meta position. So in that case, Br adds at meta, but not at para. So in such a case, para product is zero? Or maybe only a minor fraction.

Wait, that might not be correct. Because sometimes, if the substituent is such that it's a meta director but also has some ortho/para directing effects, but I think that's not the case. For example, nitro groups are strong meta directors, so they don't direct to para.

Wait, but methyl is an o/p director. So the Br adds to the para position, leading to a high fraction of para product.

So, let's go through each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: o/p director, activating. So Br can add in o and p. So para product is major. So high weight fraction of para.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: ester group, which is a meta director, deactivating. So Br adds meta. So the para product is not formed. So the weight fraction of para is zero.

3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is an o/p director, but deactivating. So Br adds in o and p positions. So para product is formed, but since the ring is deactivating, the reaction might be slower. Wait, but the question is about the fraction, not the rate. So whether the substituent is activating or deactivating affects the site but not the fraction as much, perhaps. So if substituent is o/p, Br adds to o and p. So para is a major product.

4) C6H5-NO2: nitro group, strong deactivating, meta director. So Br adds in meta positions. So para product is not formed. So weight fraction is zero.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's activating, o/p director. So Br adds to o and p. So para product is major.

6) C6H5-COOH: carboxylic acid group, which is a strong deactivating, meta director. So Br adds in meta positions. So para product is not formed. So weight fraction is zero.

Wait, but wait. Some substituents can have a strong activating effect, leading to more para product. Others may have a weaker activating effect, leading to less? Or perhaps the substituent's ability to direct is stronger in some cases.

Wait, but according to the above, substituents 2,4,6 are all meta directors, so their para fraction is zero. Substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors, so their para fraction is high.

But wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." So perhaps for substituents that are meta directors, only one product is formed (since para isn't formed), but for o/p directors, perhaps the product is a mixture of ortho and para. But the question says that each reaction forms only one product. So that makes me think that perhaps each reaction forms a single product, meaning that for some substituents, the reaction only leads to a single position. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that they have only one possible position for substitution. For example, substituents that are strongly activating in a way that makes only one position viable, or due to steric hindrance.

Wait, perhaps when a substituent is in a position where o and p are equivalent, or when only one position is possible.

Alternatively, maybe when a substituent is such that the ring is so activated that substitution occurs only in the para position, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's directing effect leads to a single product. For example, if the substituent is such that only the para position is possible due to symmetry. Wait, that's possible with substituents in certain positions. For example, if the substituent is in a position that makes the ring symmetric, so that adding Br in the para position is the only option.

Wait, but the substituent is attached in a fixed position. So for each of the six compounds, the substituent is at a certain position, perhaps in a monosubstituted benzene ring. So, for example, substance 1 is toluene with a methyl group attached at position 1. When bromine adds, it can add in o (2 or 6), m (3 or 5), or p (4). But the substituent directs where it adds.

Wait, but for the case when the substituent is strongly activating, maybe the para product is a major product but a mixture with some ortho. But the question states that each reaction only produces one product, implying that perhaps the reaction is such that only one position is possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question probably assumes that each substituent directs the bromine to a single position, either para, meta, or ortho, and that for each, the para product's weight fraction can be 0, 50%, or 100%.

Wait, but no. For o/p directors, the product is a mixture of ortho and para. So for each substituent, the para product's fraction is a certain percentage.

Wait, but the question says, arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para-isomer. So for each substituent, the para fraction is a certain value, and we need to arrange the substances from the lowest para fraction to the highest.

So, substituents that are o/p directors will have some para product, while meta directors have none. Now, among the o/p directors, which substituent leads to the highest para fraction?

The para fraction depends on the substituent's strength as a director. So a strong activating group (like -OCH3) would have a higher para fraction than a weaker activating group (like -CH3). Because the activating groups make the ring more reactive, and the o/p positions are favored, but the para tends to be the major product.

Wait, but for the substituents that are o/p directors, the para product is a major part, but maybe not all. So for example, methyl is an o/p director, but the para product is a major fraction, but not 100%. Similarly, Cl is an o/p director but deactivating, so perhaps the para product is less than in the case of methyl.

Wait, but the substituent's nature affects the relative amounts of ortho and para products. For example, a strong activating group (like -NH2) would lead to more para product, perhaps because the para position is more accessible or because of steric effects. Alternatively, for a substituent like -Cl, which is o/p but deactivating, perhaps the para product is the major one as well, but less so than in the case of a strong activating group.

Alternatively, substituents with strong ortho directing effects (like -NO2 in some cases? No, wait, nitro is meta director) would lead to more ortho product. Wait, no. Wait, let's think: for a substituent that is a strong o/p director, which is more favored, ortho or para? It depends on the substituent. For example, when the substituent is strongly activating, the ortho and para positions are both activated, but the para is usually more substituted because of steric hindrance. Wait, but the substituent's own position and the ring's structure play a role.

Alternatively, perhaps the para product is generally more favored than ortho due to steric hindrance. So for o/p directors, the para product is the major one. So in such a case, the substituent's ability to activate the ring would determine the rate, but the position (para) would be the major product.

So, if substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors, their para fractions are high, while substituents 2,4,6 have para fractions of zero. So the order would be substituents 2,4,6 have zero para, and 1,3,5 have some. Now, the question is, which of 1,3,5 has the highest para fraction and which the lowest.

Wait, but how to compare between 1,3,5. Let's list them:

1) C6H5-CH3 (methyl)
3) C6H5-Cl
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl)

Methyl is a stronger activating group than ethyl? Or is it the other way around? Or maybe Cl is deactivating, which would mean that in substituent 3, the ring is less reactive, so the para product is less favored in terms of amount.

Wait, but the substituent's effect on directing is more about the position than the amount. But the substituent's activation affects the reactivity. But since the question is about the weight fraction, perhaps the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects how much of the product is para.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's activating strength affects the para fraction. So a stronger activating group would lead to a higher para product weight fraction.

So among 1,3,5, the methyl group is a stronger activating group than ethyl. Cl is deactivating, but it's an o/p director, so perhaps in substituent 3, the ring is less reactive, but the para product is still formed. So the para fraction for substituent 3 would be less than substituent 1 (methyl), but more than substituent 5 (ethyl? Or wait, ethyl is activating, but perhaps less than methyl.

Wait, wait. Let me think about activating groups. The order of activating effect is: -NH2 > -OCH3 > -R (alkyl groups) > -X (like -Cl) but wait, Cl is deactivating because its inductive effect (-I) is stronger than its resonance (+M) effect. So Cl is deactivating but o/p director.

So substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating. So it directs to o/p but the ring is less reactive. So the para product would be formed, but perhaps in a lower proportion compared to methyl.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction. So when a substituent is a strong activating group, the ring is more reactive, but the para product is a major product. So substituent 1 (methyl) is a stronger activating group than substituent 5 (ethyl). So substituent 1 would have a higher para fraction than substituent 5.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group, but it's an o/p director. So in this case, the para product would be formed, but since the ring is less reactive, perhaps the para fraction is lower than substituent 5? Or higher?

Wait, no. The activating groups make the ring more reactive, but the substituent's effect on directing is separate. So Cl is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive, but it is an o/p director. So the para product would form, but perhaps less than in the case of methyl or ethyl.

Wait, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is less reactive than 1 and 5, but it's an o/p director, so the para product is formed. But how does the deactivation affect the para fraction?

Hmm, perhaps the para fraction is not directly affected by the deactivation but more by the substituent's directing effect. So substituent 3 directs to para, but the ring is less reactive, but the para product is still formed. So the para fraction for substituent 3 would be present, but substituent 5 (ethyl) is more activating than Cl, so substituent 5's para product fraction is higher than substituent 3.

Wait, but substituent 3 is a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive. So the reaction is slower, but we are considering the position, not the rate. So in terms of position, substituent 3 directs to o/p, so the para product is formed, but maybe less than substituent 1 and 5.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about each substituent's para product fraction:

Substituent 2: COOEt (ester) → meta director → para fraction = 0.

Substituent 4: NO2 → meta → para fraction =0.

Substituent 6: COOH → meta → para fraction=0.

Substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors.

Comparing 1,3,5:

Substituent 1: methyl, strongest activating → high para fraction.

Substituent 3: Cl, deactivating but o/p → para fraction is present but lower than 1, perhaps.

Substituent5: ethyl, activating but weaker than methyl → para fraction is higher than 3 but lower than 1.

Wait, but wait. Cl is deactivating, which makes the ring less reactive. So even though it's an o/p director, the para product may be the only product or more than in the case of ethyl?

Alternatively, maybe the para product's weight fraction is influenced by the substituent's ability to activate the ring. A more activating substituent leads to more para product.

So substituent 1 (methyl) is more activating than 5 (ethyl) → higher para fraction.

Substituent 3 (Cl) is deactivating → lower para fraction than both 1 and 5.

So order of para fractions from lowest to highest:

Substituent 3 (Cl) → substituent5 (ethyl) → substituent1 (methyl).

Wait, but substituent 3 is deactivating, so perhaps its para product is lower than substituent5's.

Wait, but substituent3's para product is higher than substituent2,4,6, which have zero. So the order of para fractions is:

2=4=6 (0) <3 <5 <1.

But wait, substituent5 is ethyl, which is an activating group. So substituent5's para fraction is higher than substituent3's.

So the order would be substituent2,4,6 (0) < substituent3 < substituent5 < substituent1.

Wait, but substituent3's para fraction is higher or lower than substituent5?

Wait, substituent3 is Cl, which is deactivating. So the ring is less reactive, but since the substituent is an o/p director, the para product is formed. Let's say that substituent3 has a para fraction of, say, 50% (just as an example), while substituent5 (ethyl) has a higher fraction, like 60%, and substituent1 (methyl) has 70%.

So the order from lowest to highest para fraction would be:

substituent3 (Cl) < substituent5 (ethyl) < substituent1 (methyl) < others (but others are zero).

Wait, no. Because substituent3's para fraction is 50%, substituent5 is 60%, substituent1 is 70%, while substituents2,4,6 have 0.

So arranging all six substances in order of increasing para fraction:

substituent2,4,6 (0) < substituent3 (50%) < substituent5 (60%) < substituent1 (70%).

But the question has six substances, so substituents 2,4,6 are at 0, substituent3 is next, then substituent5, then substituent1.

Wait, but substituent3 has a higher para fraction than substituent2,4,6, but how about compared to substituent5?

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the substituents' directing strength. Let's rank substituents in terms of their directing effect.

The substituents that are o/p directors and activating will have higher para fractions. Among them, which group is the strongest activating? The order of activating groups is: -NH2 > -OCH3 > -R (alkyl) such as methyl, ethyl > -X (like -Cl).

Wait, but wait, Cl is deactivating. So among substituents 1,3,5: substituent1 (methyl) is activating, substituent3 (Cl) is deactivating, substituent5 (ethyl) is activating but weaker than methyl.

So substituent1 is the strongest activating, leading to the highest para fraction. Substituent5 is weaker than 1 but stronger than 3. Substituent3, being deactivating, has a lower para fraction than 5 and 1.

So the order of para fractions would be:

substituent3 < substituent5 < substituent1.

Substituents2,4,6 have zero.

So arranging all six substances in order of increasing para fraction:

substituent2,4,6 (0) < substituent3 < substituent5 < substituent1.

But let's see the options given. The options are options A, B, C, D. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 4 < 2 <6 <3<1 <5

Option B:6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4

Wait, the options list the order from lowest to highest.

Wait, the question is to arrange the six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So from lowest para fraction to highest.

So the order would be:

substituent2,4,6 (all 0) < substituent3 (Cl) < substituent5 (ethyl) < substituent1 (methyl).

But wait, substituent3 is a deactivating o/p director, so its para fraction is higher than substituent2,4,6, but lower than substituent5 and 1.

So the order is 2,4,6 (0) <3 <5 <1.

But there are six substituents, so I need to arrange all six. The substituents with 0 para fraction are 2,4,6.

So the order from lowest to highest:

substituent2,4,6 < substituent3 < substituent5 < substituent1.

Wait, but substituent2,4,6 have zero. So the order would be 2,4,6 come first, followed by 3, then 5, then 1.

But substituent3's para fraction is higher than 2,4,6.

So the order is: 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

But the substituents 2,4,6 all have zero, and their order among themselves is perhaps arbitrary, but the options group them in a certain order.

Wait, but in the options, which one lists substituents 2,4,6 first, followed by 3, then 5, then 1?

Looking at the options:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → starts with 4, then 2, then 6, then 3, then 1, then 5.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the weight fraction of para isomer depends on the substituent's ability to direct to para and the substituent's activating effect.

The substituents can be ranked as follows in terms of para fraction:

Substituents that are meta directors: 2,4,6 → para fraction 0.

Among o/p directors:

Cl (3) is deactivating → low para fraction.

Ethyl (5) is activating, so higher than Cl.

Methyl (1) is more activating than ethyl → highest para fraction.

So the order of para fractions is:

substituent3 < substituent5 < substituent1.

So overall, substituents in order of increasing para fraction: 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

But in the options, which option has 2,4,6 first, then 3, then 5, then 1?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5 → 4 first, then 2, 6, then 3, then 1, then 5. So substituents 2,4,6 are in the beginning, but their order is 4 <2 <6.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → starts with 6, then 2,4,5,1,3. Not correct.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → substituents 4,6,2 come first, then 1,5,3.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → starts with 3, then 5,1,6,2,4. No.

Hmm. None of the options seems to directly match the order I thought, which is 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1. Let me think again.

Perhaps I should consider that substituent 3 (Cl) is a weaker o/p director than substituent5 (ethyl) and 1 (methyl). So substituent3 has a lower para fraction than 5 and 1.

So substituent3's para fraction is less than 5 and 1, but more than 0.

So the order for the six substituents from lowest to highest para fraction is:

2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Now, looking at the options, which one starts with 2,4,6 in some order, followed by3, then5, then1.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5. So substituents 4,2,6 are first (all 0), then comes 3, then 1, then5.

Wait, but substituent5 has a higher para fraction than substituent3, so in the correct order, substituent5 should come after substituent3. But in option A, after 3 comes 1 and then5. That would place substituent5 after 1, which is incorrect because substituent5's para fraction is less than substituent1's but higher than substituent3's. So in the order, substituent5 should come after substituent3 and before substituent1.

Looking at the options, option A goes 4,2,6, then3, then1, then5. That would have substituent5 last, which is higher than substituent3 but lower than substituent1.

But according to the correct order, substituent5 is after3 but before1, and substituent1 is the highest. So option A's order would be 4<2<6<3<1<5, which would imply substituent5 has a higher para fraction than 3 and 1, but that's not correct because substituent1 is higher than 5.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct order is 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

But none of the options present substituents 2,4,6 all before 3.

Looking at the options again:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → 4,2,6 are first (all 0), then 3, then1, then5. But substituent5 has a higher para fraction than3, so this order is wrong.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → substituents4,6,2 (all 0), then1, then5, then3. But substituent3 has higher than 2's group, so this is wrong.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → starts with3, which is incorrect because substituents2,4,6 have zero.

So perhaps the correct arrangement is:

substituents with 0 para fraction (2,4,6) < substituent3 < substituent5 < substituent1.

But in the options, none exactly match this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong in assuming that substituent3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than substituents 2,4,6. Maybe substituent3 doesn't have any para product, but that's not correct because Cl is an o/p director.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me re-examine the substituents' directing effects.

Substituent3 is Cl. Cl is a deactivating group but an ortho/para director. So when it undergoes electrophilic substitution, the Br can add to the ortho or para positions. So the para product would be formed, but since the Cl is deactivating, the ring is less reactive. However, the presence of Cl as an o/p director means that para product is formed, but perhaps in lower amounts compared to activating groups.

Wait, but in the question's context, each substituent leads to only one monobromo product. So perhaps in this case, the substituent's directing effect is such that only the para product is formed, leading to a 100% yield of para. Or perhaps only ortho or only para.

Wait, that complicates things. Because if substituent3 (Cl) is o/p director, and the reaction produces only one product, then perhaps the product is either ortho or para. But for para substitution, would that be more likely?

Alternatively, perhaps for substituent3, bromine adds only to the para position, making the product para with 100% yield. Or perhaps it's the ortho.

Wait, but in reality, for Cl substituent, the para product is the major product.

Wait, but the question states that only one monobromo product is formed. So perhaps for substituent3, the para product is formed exclusively. Similarly, for substituent1 (methyl), para is the major product, but perhaps it's possible to have only para product due to steric reasons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case where the substituent has a strong activating effect, making only the para position reactive. For example, -OCH3 is a strong activating group, and the para product is the major one, but sometimes the ortho may not be possible due to steric hindrance.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) is ortho/para but due to steric hindrance, the para is the only possible product. For example, in certain substituent configurations, ortho may be sterically hindered, so only para is formed.

Wait, but without knowing the exact substituent positions, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents' effects are such that:

Substituent3 (Cl): meta and para are possible? No, Cl is o/p.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the question is considering that for substituents that are meta directors, the para fraction is zero, and for substituents that are o/p directors, the para fraction is 100% (i.e., the product is only para). But that's not accurate because o/p directors give a mixture of ortho and para.

Wait, but the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps each substituent directs to only a single position, leading to a single product.

If that's the case, then substituent3 (Cl) would have only para product, because the ortho may not be possible due to steric hindrance. Similarly, substituent1 (methyl) would have only para product because the ortho may be hindered, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's position on the ring makes the para product the only possible one. For example, if the substituent is in a position where ortho substitution is hindered, then only para is formed.

But without that information, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the substituent's ability to activate the ring toward substitution in the para position. For example, substituents that are strong activating groups (like -NH2) would lead to para substitution, while substituents that are deactivating (like -NO2) would not. But again, this is getting me stuck.

Wait, perhaps the order is based on the substituent's ability to activate the para position. So, substituent1 (methyl) is better activating than substituent5 (ethyl), which is better than substituent3 (Cl, which is deactivating). So the order of para fraction is:

Cl (3) < ethyl (5) < methyl (1).

Substituents2,4,6 have 0.

So the six substituents in order from lowest to highest para fraction:

2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Looking at the options, which one represents this?

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → which would mean substituent5 is higher than substituent1, which is incorrect.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → substituent3 is last, which can't be.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → same issue.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → starts with3, which is wrong because substituents2,4,6 have zero.

Hmm. None of the options match exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) doesn't form any para product because it's a deactivating group. But no, Cl is o/p director, so para product is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) is a meta director. No, Cl is o/p.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 is meta director. No, no. Nitro is meta, Cl is o/p.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The question might be referring to the para-substituted product's weight fraction as being the major product.

For substituents that are meta directors, the para product is not formed. For substituents that are o/p directors, the para product is formed in varying amounts.

But the relative amounts of para and ortho are influenced by the substituent's activating effect. So stronger activating groups (like NH2) lead to more para product.

So in the case of substituents being o/p directors, the order of para fraction from low to high is:

Cl (3) < ethyl (5) < methyl (1).

Substituents 2,4,6 have 0.

So the order would be substituents2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

So the correct order should be 2,4,6 come first, then3, then5, then1.

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. So substituent5 is after 1, which is incorrect because substituent5 should be before substituent1.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each substituent's para fraction:

1) methyl: high para fraction. Let's say 60%.

2) COOEt: 0.

3) Cl: moderate, say 30%.

4) NO2: 0.

5) ethyl: higher than Cl, say 40%.

6) COOH: 0.

So the order of para fractions is:

substituent2,4,6 (0) < substituent3 (30%) < substituent5 (40%) < substituent1 (60%).

Now, arranging the six substituents in order of increasing para fraction:

2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Which option matches this? Let's see.

Looking at the options again:

Option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → substituent5 comes after substituent1, which is not correct as 5 should come before1.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → substituent5 is last, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps none of the options exactly match, but based on the given options, the correct order is 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Looking back, the options don't have this exact order. So perhaps the correct option is option A, which is 4<2<6<3<1<5. But substituent5 is after substituent1, which is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that substituent3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than substituent2,4,6. But that can't be since substituent3 is o/p, and 2,4,6 are meta.

No, that's not correct. Substituent3 is o/p, so its para fraction is higher than substituents2,4,6.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because substituent5 has a higher para fraction than substituent3, so in the increasing order, substituent3 comes before substituent5. But in option A, substituent3 is before substituent5.

Looking again, option A is: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So substituent3 comes before substituent1 and5. But according to our analysis, substituent5 has a higher para fraction than3, so substituent5 should come after3 but before1.

So the correct order would have substituent3, then5, then1.

But in option A, substituent5 comes after1, which is incorrect.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option C.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

No, that's not right because substituent5's para fraction is higher than substituent3.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the para fraction order.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than substituent5 (ethyl). So substituent5's para fraction is higher than substituent3's.

Therefore, the correct order is 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Looking at the options, none directly match. But perhaps option A is the closest, but it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A. Let me think why.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) and substituent5 (ethyl) have the same para fraction. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the order goes 6 <2 <4 <3 <5 <1.

Looking at option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → substituent3 is last, which is wrong.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → starts with3, which is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct order is 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1, and the only option that starts with 2,4,6 in some order is option A.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which lists 4,2,6, then3, then1, then5.

But why would substituent5 come after1?

Wait, perhaps substituent5's para fraction is lower than substituent1's, which is correct, but higher than substituent3's.

So the order would be substituents2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Looking at option A: substituents4,2,6 are first, then3, then1, then5. So substituent5 is after1, which is incorrect.

So perhaps none of the options are correct, but given the options, the closest would be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is substituent3 < substituent5 < substituent1, and substituents2,4,6 are the lowest.

So the order would be 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Looking for which option reflects this order among the six substituents.

Option A has substituent5 after1, which is incorrect.

Option C has substituent5 after1.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about whether substituent3 (Cl) is an o/p director but deactivating, which could lead to a lower para fraction than substituent5 (ethyl). Because ethyl is activating, so bromine is more likely to add to para, leading to a higher fraction. So substituent5 would have a higher para fraction than substituent3.

So in that case, the order is 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

So the correct sequence is:

substituents 2,4,6 (0) → substituent3 (low) → substituent5 (higher) → substituent1 (highest).

So the substituents arranged in order are: 2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Looking at the options, option A:4<2<6<3<1<5 → substituent5 is after1, which is incorrect.

Option B:6<2<4<5<1<3 → substituent3 is last, which is wrong.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → substituent5 is after1, which is wrong.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → substituent3 is first, which is wrong.

Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the para fraction inversely? Or perhaps the substituent's position on the ring affects the product.

Wait, perhaps substituent3 (Cl) is meta to the incoming Br. Wait, no. The substituent is at position1, and Br adds to position4 (para). So Cl is an o/p director, so Br adds to para. So the product is para.

So substituent3's para fraction is high, but since Cl is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, but the product is para.

Wait, but in this case, the para product is formed, but the substituent is deactivating, so the reaction might not proceed as much, but the question is about the fraction, not the amount of product.

Wait, but the question states that each reaction forms one product, so perhaps in the case of substituent3, the para is the only product. So substituent3's para fraction is 100%, while substituent5's is lower, say 70%, and substituent1's is even higher, like 90%? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the para product's fraction is the same for all o/p directors, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps for substituents that are o/p directors, the para fraction is the same, but I don't think that's true.

Hmm. Maybe the correct order is substituent3 < substituent5 < substituent1, so the options must reflect this.

Looking again, the only option where substituent3 comes before substituent5 and substituent1 is option A.

Wait, but substituent3's para fraction is higher than substituent2,4,6, but lower than substituent5 and1.

So the order is substituents2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Thus, in the list of all six, the order would be substituents2,4,6 (all 0) followed by3,5,1.

Looking at the options, option A has substituent3 before substituent1 and5, but after substituents2,4,6. So substituent3 is fourth in the list.

In option A, the order is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But substituent5 should come before substituent1.

So perhaps the correct order is substituent5 before1.

Looking at the options, none have that. So perhaps the correct option is A, but substituent5 is after substituent1.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Another approach: perhaps the substituent's para fraction depends on the substituent's ability to activate the ring. So stronger activating groups lead to more para product.

So substituent1 (methyl) is activating → high para.

Substituent5 (ethyl) is activating but less than methyl → medium para.

Substituent3 (Cl) is deactivating but o/p → low para.

Substituents2,4,6 are meta directors → 0 para.

So the order of para fractions:

2,4,6 (0) <3 <5 <1.

So the correct arrangement is substituents2,4,6 <3 <5 <1.

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So substituent5 is after1, which is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but given the options, I must choose the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong and substituent3 has a lower para fraction than substituent2,4,6, but that's impossible because substituent3 is o/p, while 2,4,6 are meta.

So I think the correct order is substituents2,4,6 <3 <5 <1, and the only option that starts with substituents2,4,6 is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


To determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in their electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can either activate or deactivate the ring and direct the incoming electrophile to ortho, meta, or para positions. The weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on the substituent's ability to direct the electrophile to the para position and its activating or deactivating nature.

### Analysis of Substituents:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. Strongly activates the ring, leading to a high weight fraction of the para-isomer.
2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester)**: Deactivating, meta director. Does not form the para-isomer, so the weight fraction is 0.
3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**: Deactivating, ortho/para director. Weakly activates the ring, leading to a low weight fraction of the para-isomer.
4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director. Does not form the para-isomer, so the weight fraction is 0.
5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl)**: Activating, ortho/para director. Less activating than methyl, leading to a moderate weight fraction of the para-isomer.
6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic Acid)**: Strongly deactivating, meta director. Does not form the para-isomer, so the weight fraction is 0.

### Order of Increasing Weight Fraction of the Para-Isomer:
- Substituents 2 (C6H5-COOC2H5), 4 (C6H5-NO2), and 6 (C6H5-COOH) have a weight fraction of 0 because they are meta directors.
- Substituent 3 (C6H5-Cl) has the lowest para fraction among the ortho/para directors due to its deactivating nature.
- Substituent 5 (C6H5-C2H5) has a higher para fraction than 3 because it is a weaker activating group.
- Substituent 1 (C6H5-CH3) has the highest para fraction due to its strong activating effect.

Thus, the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer is:

**2, 4, 6 < 3 < 5 < 1**

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5)**: Substituents 2, 4, and 6 are correctly placed first, but substituent 5 is incorrectly placed after 1. This option is not fully correct.
- **Option B (6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3)**: Substituents 2, 4, and 6 are incorrectly ordered, and substituent 3 is placed last, which is incorrect.
- **Option C (4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3)**: Substituents 2, 4, and 6 are incorrectly ordered, and substituent 3 is placed last, which is incorrect.
- **Option D (3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4)**: Substituent 3 is incorrectly placed first, which is invalid since substituents 2, 4, and 6 have a weight fraction of 0.

### Conclusion:
The correct order is **2, 4, 6 < 3 < 5 < 1**, but none of the options fully match this order. Based on the given options, the closest match is **Option A**.
