Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the chemical formula from the options given.

First, let me think about the FTIR data. The key peaks here are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm⁻¹. The broad peak around 3000 might indicate O-H stretching, maybe from an alcohol or carboxylic acid. Wait, but alcohols have a broad peak around 3300, while carboxylic acids are broader and around 2500-3300. Wait, but the peak here is at 3000, which is in the middle. Hmm. Alternatively, it could be N-H stretching, but the options don't have nitrogen. So perhaps it's an O-H group, maybe from an alcohol or maybe a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. If it's an alcohol, then the broad peak is likely due to the O-H stretch.

Then, the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester or something. Alternatively, it might be a conjugated carbonyl, such as a conjugated ketone or an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is a different type.

Wait, but the 1650 cm⁻¹ is lower than 1700. So it's a different kind of carbonyl. Maybe an ester's carbonyl is around 1700, and the 1650 could be conjugated or part of another group. Alternatively, maybe one is a ketone and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? Wait, no, aromatic C=C is usually around 1600. So if there's a peak at 1650, it's more like a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide, but no N here. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with some substituents.

Hmm, but maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring (C=C) stretch. But wait, the aromatic ring's C=C is usually around 1450-1600. So 1650 is a bit high for that. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. That would have a lower carbonyl stretch, maybe around 1680 or so, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, like an ester, which is around 17
