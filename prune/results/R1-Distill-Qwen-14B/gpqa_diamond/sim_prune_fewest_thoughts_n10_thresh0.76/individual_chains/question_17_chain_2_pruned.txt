Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking. 

The problem is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, and the conditions are ideal pH, temperature is 25°C. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is present in the solution. The question is about the free calcium ion concentration.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (K) for a complex indicates how stable the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. For the complex CaEDTA²-, the K would be the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA⁴- ↔ CaEDTA²⁻.

So the formula for the stability constant K is K = [CaEDTA²⁻]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Since the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²⁻, that's the concentration of the complex.

But wait, EDTA exists in different forms depending on the pH. Oh, the question says the pH is ideal, which probably means that the form of EDTA present is EDTA⁴-. So I can ignore the other forms and just use EDTA⁴- in the calculation.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M. Let me think about the dissociation. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴-.

Let’s set up an ICE table. Let’s say x is the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, the change would be:

[CaEDTA²-]: 0.02 - x
[Ca²+]: x
[EDTA⁴-]: x

Wait, because for each mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced. So if the complex is 0.0
