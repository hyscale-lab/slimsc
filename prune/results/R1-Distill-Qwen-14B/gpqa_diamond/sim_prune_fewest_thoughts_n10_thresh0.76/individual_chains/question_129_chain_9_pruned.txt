Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound E is formed through a series of reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem gives me a reaction scheme starting from compound A and going through several steps to produce E. There are also some hints provided, which I should make sure to consider.

Let me write down what each step involves.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Looking at the options, all of them are cyclic ketones, I think. So E is a ketone. The question is about identifying which one.

Now, the hints:

Hint a) Compound A when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm. A phosphorous ylide is typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting a ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So compound A must be a ketone because it reacts with a ylide to form an alkene.

Wait, the product of the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize that structure. So cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and a substituent at position 4 which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)= group? Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH2?), no. Wait, propan-2-ylidene group is CH2-C(CH3)- where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 of the substituent? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think: propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH2C=) but that's not quite right. Maybe it's CH2=CHCH2â€“ but no, wait. Wait, ylides are usually R2P=CH-. Oh wait, no, the product of the Wittig is an alkene. So the structure given is a cyclopentane with substituents.

So the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2-C(CH3)= substituent attached to the ring. So the substituent is a propyl group with a double bond, maybe like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 but connected where? Or perhaps it's a substituent with a double bond attached to the cyclopentane.

Wait, perhaps the propan-2-ylidene is (CH2CH(CH3))=CH2? No, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to draw this mentally. The substituent is at position 4 of the cyclopentane. So the
