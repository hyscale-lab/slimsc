Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, and n is a unit vector. Oh wait, σ · n is the dot product, so that's σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. And ε is an energy constant.

I remember that Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you take a dot product of σ with a unit vector n, what does that operator look like? Oh right, σ · n is a matrix, and its eigenvalues are the possible values you can get when you measure the spin in the direction of n.

So the eigenvalues of σ · n should be ±1, because each Pauli matrix's eigenvalues are ±1, and the direction doesn't affect the magnitude of the eigenvalues. So when you scale it by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε. Because if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, multiplying by ε gives ±ε as the eigenvalues for H.

Wait, but what about the units? The problem says ε has dimension energy. So H has units of energy, as it should. So the eigenvalues should indeed be ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So that must be the right answer.

Wait, are there any other factors? Oh, sometimes when
