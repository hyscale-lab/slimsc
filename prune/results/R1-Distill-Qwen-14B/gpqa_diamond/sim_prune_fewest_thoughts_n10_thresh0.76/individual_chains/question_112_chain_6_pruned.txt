Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

So, the problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Right, and |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that the spin operator in the z-direction is S_z, and its eigenstates are |up> with eigenvalue ħ/2 and |down> with -ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. So, I need to figure out what this operator is. Let me think about the structure of the matrix. 

For a 2x2 system, the matrix would look like:
[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0  ]

Because the diagonal elements are zero when i=j (since A_ij is zero in that case) and non-zero when i≠j.

Wait a minute, this looks familiar. Oh right! This looks like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, the off-diagonal elements become ħ/2.

So the operator in question is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Or maybe it's just a multiple of σ_x. But for the purpose of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the scaling factor might not matter right away.

The question asks me to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Since the operator is proportional to σ_x, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x. Let me recall the eigenstates of σ_x. They are the |+x> and |-x> states, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. Or wait, is it the other way around? I think |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/√2, and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/√2, scaled appropriately. Alternatively, sometimes |+x> is written as (|up> + |down>)/√2 multiplied by some phase. Wait, no, the phase doesn't affect the probability, so maybe it's easier not to worry about that.

So, the eigenstates of the operator A (which is (ħ/2) σ_x) are |+x> and |-x>, so when I express |alpha> in terms of these, the coefficients will give me the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, so I need to change basis. Alternatively, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x> and find the coefficients.

But first, let me express |alpha> properly. The problem says |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, it's a linear combination, but not necessarily normalized. I'll need to normalize it first before finding probabilities, I think.

Wait, so the state is |alpha> = C [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ], where C is a normalization constant. Let's compute C. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So, the inner product <alpha|alpha> would be |C|^2 times [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ].

Wait, let's compute each term. The first term is (1-i)(1+i) = (1)^2 + (i)^2 - 2i + 2i? Wait no, (1-i)(1+i) = 1*(1) +1*(i) -i*(1) -i*(i) = 1 + i -i -i². Since i² is -1, so 1 - (-1) = 2. So the first term is 2.

The second term is (2-i)*(2+i) = 4 +2i -2i -i² = 4 - (-1) = 5. So the total is 2 +5 =7.

So |C|^2 *7 =1 → |C|=1/√7.

So the state becomes |alpha> = (1/√7)[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>].

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A, which are |+x> and |-x>. Let's denote them as |+x> = 1/√2 (|up> + |down>), and |-x> = 1/√2 (|up> - |down>).

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me set up the equation:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

Substituting the expressions, we have:

(1/√7)[ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] = a (1/√2)(|up> + |down>) + b (1/√2)(|up> - |down>).

Let me collect terms for |up> and |down>:

Coefficient of |up> on the RHS: (a + b)/√2
Coefficient of |down> on the RHS: (a - b)/√2

On the LHS, the coefficients are (1+i)/√7 and (2 -i)/√7.

So, setting the coefficients equal:

( a + b ) / √2 = (1 + i)/√7
( a - b ) / √2 = (2 - i)/√7

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (a + b) = [ (1 + i) /√7 ] * √2
Equation 2: (a - b) = [ (2 - i) /√7 ] * √2

To solve for a and b, let me add and subtract these equations.

Adding equation 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] /√7 * √2
Simplify numerator: 3 / √7 * √2 → 3/(√7) * (√2/1) = 3√2 / √7.

Wait, wait. Let me compute [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] = 3. So,

2a = (3) / √7 * √2 → a = (3)/(2√7) * √2 → a = 3√2/(2√7) → which can be written as 3/(√14) since √2/(2√7) = 1/(√14).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / √7 * √2
Numerator: (1 + i) - (2 - i) = (1-2) + (i + i )= (-1) + 2i.

So,

2b = (-1 + 2i) / √7 * √2 → b = [ (-1 + 2i) √2 ] / (2√7 )

Which simplifies to [ (-√2) + 2i√2 ]/(2√7) → (-1 + 2i)√2 / (2√7) → which is [ (-1 + 2i) ]/(√14) since √2/(2√7) = 1/(√14).

Wait, no: √2/(2√7) = (√2)/(2√7) → multiply numerator and denominator by √7: (√14)/(2*7) )= √14/(14) → 1/(√14) because √14/14 = (√14)/(14) = 1/(√14) because (√14)^2 is 14, so 14 = (√14)^2 → √14/14 = 1/√14.

So,

a = (3√2)/(2√7) → 3/(√14) → because √2/(2√7) → √2/(2√7) = [√2 * √7 ]/(2*7) ) → √14/(14) → 1/(√14) * (3), so a = 3/(√14).

Similarly, b is [ (-1 + 2i) ]/(√14).

Wait
