Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 column vector. Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a unit vector, but let me check the length here. So the components are -1, 2, and 1. The length squared would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the state vector has a squared norm of 6. So it's not normalized. That might complicate things because probabilities are based on normalized states. So perhaps I should normalize it first?

Wait, the problem says it's the state at time t. So maybe the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), but without normalization. So when I calculate probabilities, I'll have to normalize it. That's an important point.

The operators P and Q are given. Let's look at their matrices.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: (0, 1/√2, 0)
Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2)
Third row: (0, 1/√2, 0)

Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. Let me see if it's Hermitian, because observables should be Hermitian. Each element a_ij must equal a_ji* (the conjugate transpose). Let me check. The (1,2) element is 1/√2. The (2,1) element is 1/√2, which is the same, so no imaginary part. Similarly, (2,3) is 1/√2 and (3,2) is 1/√2, same. So P's matrix is symmetric, so it's Hermitian. Good.

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: (1, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -1)
So that's diagonal. Diagonals are 1,0,-1. So Q is definitely Hermitian as well.

The question is: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, the order is important. So first P is measured, then Q is measured. But wait, the question is about getting P=0 and Q=-1 in the respective measurements. So I think it's the probability that, when you measure P first, you get 0, then measure Q and get -1.

But wait, the measurement of P affects the state. Because when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of the operator. So after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Then, in that new state, measuring
