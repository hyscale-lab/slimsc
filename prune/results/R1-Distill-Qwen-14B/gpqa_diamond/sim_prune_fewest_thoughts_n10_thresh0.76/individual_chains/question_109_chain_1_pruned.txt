Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Oh right, Pauli statistics are involved, which probably relates to the total wavefunction being antisymmetric. 

Wait, the problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So when the NN emits X, their state changes. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find which partial wave isn't allowed based on angular momentum and parity conservation.

Let me try to outline what I know. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is written (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0 must mean S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L=0 (since S is in spectroscopic notation, S is 0), and J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, T=0? Wait, not sure about the isospin part. Wait, I think for two nucleons, the isospin can be T=0 or 1. Initially, in 1S0 state, I think T=0. Because the 1S0 state is usually the singlet state, so T=0.

When they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The parity of the initial state is parity of NN. The NN state has L=0, so their parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. Because parity is (-1)^L for orbital angular momentum.

When they emit X, the parity of the system (NN + X) must be the same as the initial parity. Because parity is a conserved quantity in strong interactions, I think. The initial parity is +1. The final parity is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Wait, no, the parity of the entire system is the product of the parity of
