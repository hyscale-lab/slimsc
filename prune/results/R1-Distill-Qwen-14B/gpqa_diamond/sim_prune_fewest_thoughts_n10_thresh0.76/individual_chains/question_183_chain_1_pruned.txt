Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency in a product formed after a reaction. Hmm, index of hydrogen deficiency, right? That's like the double bond equivalent, counting the rings and double bonds in a molecule. 

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, which has a double bond. The substituents on the ring are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2, wait no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, position 5 is where the vinyl is attached, and position 3 is the double bond in the cyclohexene. Also, there's a carboxylic acid group (COOH) somewhere.

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the cyclohexene ring has double bond at positions 3 and 4. Then, substituents: formyl at 2, vinyl at 5.

So the structure: 

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on the cyclohexene ring. So the ring is numbered such that the double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl (CHO) group. At position 5, there's a vinyl group, which is CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so attached to the ring carbon 5 is a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond? Wait, no. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is a -CH2CH2 group with a double bond between C5 and C6 (since the substituent is on C5). No, wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is itself a double bond. So the substituent is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two CH2sâ€”no, wait, vinyl is -CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons. So the substituent is a CH2-CH2 where the two carbons are connected by a double bond. So, the substituent on C5 is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, meaning it's a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, the structure would have a cyclohexene ring with double bond at 3-4, formyl at 2, and vinyl at 5.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no. Wait, red phosphorus with HI is used for deoxygenation of carbonyl groups, like the reduction of carbonyls to methylene groups. Alternatively, when you have a carbonyl group (like ketone or aldehyde), reacting with HI in presence of red phosphorus would lead to the formation of a CH2 group.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a situation where the formyl group (CHO) is being converted into something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a situation where the hydrogen iodide is acting as a nucleophile, but given the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's the deoxygenation reaction.

Wait, the starting molecule has a formyl group (CHO), a vinyl group (CH2CH2 with double bond), and a cyclohexene ring (so already has a double bond).

So, when you treat a carbonyl group (like aldehyde) with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? The aldehyde group (CHO) would be converted into a CH2 group. Because the aldehyde is a carbonyl, and in such conditions, it's reduced. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is more like the reagent for the Wittig reaction, but wait, no, the Wittig uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought: when aldehydes or ketones react with HX (like HI) in presence of red phosphorus, it's called the Clemmensen reduction. Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, Clemmensen is for ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. But red phosphorus and HI is a different scenario. Oh wait, wait, another reaction: the reduction of carbonyl groups to methylene (CH2) groups. So, the aldehyde (CHO) becomes CH2. So the formyl group would be converted into CH2.

So after the reaction, the formyl group (CHO) at position
