Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, I think. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the distance to an object. Wait, right, the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So if distance (d) increases, plx decreases, and vice versa.

Wait, so if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then I can substitute plx with 1/d. Let's see, plx = 1/d → so 1/(plx) = d. So substituting, N ∝ (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question isn't directly about N and d, it's about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, I think that means the differential. Like, how does the number of stars per unit distance (like dr) change with r.

Wait, let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to d^5 multiplied by the volume of the shell, but wait, wait. No, maybe it's more about the density or something else.

Wait, no. Let me approach it step by step. The problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So the number of stars in a given volume at a certain distance. So perhaps it's about the number density or the surface density as a function of distance.

Wait, the number of stars as a function of parallax is given. So, the observed number of stars in the sky varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (which means distance is large), 1/plx^5 becomes large, so the number of stars increases. So more stars are observed at larger distances?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because typically, as you look further, the number of stars you can see increases, but the density (number per unit volume) might decrease. Hmm, but maybe in this particular case, the dependence is such that the number of stars increases with distance.

Wait, but the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps they're asking about the number per unit distance, not per unit volume.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the relation between parallax and distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 / distance (in parsecs). So if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So if I have N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting d in, I get N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5.

But how does the number of stars change with distance? Are they asking for the change in the number per unit distance? That would be the derivative of N with respect to d. So if N = k * d^5, then dN/dd = 5k d^4. So the change in number per unit distance is proportional to d^4. So as d increases, the number of stars per unit distance increases with the fourth power.

Wait, but the options given are about how the number changes per unit range of distance. So maybe the correct answer is that the number of stars increases with r^4. So looking at the options, option C is r^4. Hmm.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when dealing with volumes, the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr depends on the surface area, which is 4πr², and the volume element is 4πr² dr. But in this problem, the number of stars is given in terms of parallax, not directly in terms of volume. So perhaps the approach is different.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars per unit area (surface density) varies with plx as 1/plx^5. Since surface density would be number per unit area, and area on the sky is related to solid angle. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think again.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then N is proportional to d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant.

If I think about how the number of stars increases as you go to larger distances, then for each additional distance interval dr, the number of stars added would be the derivative of N with respect to r, which is 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4. That would correspond to option C.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is r^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of the distance per unit range.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we can substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) into the equation. This gives \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases with the fourth power of distance.

Among the given options, the correct answer is \( r^4 \), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
