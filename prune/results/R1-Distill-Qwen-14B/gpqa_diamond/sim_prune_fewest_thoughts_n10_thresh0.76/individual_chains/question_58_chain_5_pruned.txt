Okay, so I have this question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a cutoff or something similar. But wait, which theories don't need this?

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option. 

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED actually doesn't require renormalization in the same way as other theories because it's "renormalizable." Wait, but does that mean it doesn't need regularization? Or does it just mean that the divergences can be handled with counterterms without needing a cutoff? I'm a bit confused here. Because regularization is a step in the renormalization process. So QED does require regularization, but it works out because the divergences are manageable.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is another gauge theory, like QED but with the strong force. It also has asymptotic freedom, which means at high energies, the coupling becomes weak. But I think QCD still requires regularization because of things like the Landau pole and other divergences. Or wait, maybe in perturbative calculations you need it, but I'm not sure.

Superstring Theory... Hmm. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity and it claims to be finite, meaning it doesn't have the same kind of divergences that quantum field theories do. So superstring theory might not require regularization because it's supposed to be free from these infinities. But wait, is that true? Because I remember that even in string theory, sometimes you have issues like the appearance of tachyons, but those are more about stability than divergences. So maybe string theory doesn't need regularization because its perturbative expansions are finite or at least don't require the same type of cutoff.

Then there's D) Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version. Well, in classical theories, you don't have the same kind of divergences as in quantum theories. For example, in classical electromagnetism, the fields are well-behaved (except maybe at point charges). So regularization isn't a concept
