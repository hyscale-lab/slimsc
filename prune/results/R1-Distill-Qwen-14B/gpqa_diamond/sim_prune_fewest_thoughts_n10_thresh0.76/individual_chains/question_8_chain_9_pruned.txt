Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. We have three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They created knockouts and double mutants, and we have their resistance levels compared to the wild-type.

First, I'll list out the resistance percentages given:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, the control is 100% resistant, and each mutant's percentage is relative to that. So, the lower the percentage, the more susceptible the plant is to the disease.

The introduction says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. Transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. So, if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates might not be expressed, which could affect resistance.

Looking at the resistance levels:

g2 is completely susceptible (0%). So, when G2 is knocked out, the plant can’t resist the pathogen at all. That suggests G2 might be a key gene, possibly a transcription factor because it's acting upstream.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would disable the pathway it's regulating. So, any downstream genes it activates wouldn't be expressed, leading to higher susceptibility.

Let's think about the double mutants. The double mutants are g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3.

g1g2 and g2g3 both have 0% resistance. So, when either G1 or G3 is knocked out along with G2, the resistance is as low as when only G2 is knocked out. Hmm, but wait, the single mutant g2 is already 0%, so the double mutants with g2 don't add anything worse than g2 alone. But perhaps they add something in terms of gene interactions.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: resistance is 10%. That's worse than each single mutant (g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%). So, together they make the resistance worse. That might suggest that G1 and G3 have some additive or synergistic effect. Or, alternatively, maybe they're part of separate pathways that each contribute some resistance, so knocking both out reduces resistance more.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others. So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor. That would mean that G1 and G3 might be downstream of G2.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then in the single mutant g2, the downstream genes (like G1 and G3) wouldn't be expressed. So, knocking out G2 would mean that G1 and G3 aren't expressed either, perhaps? Or maybe some of them are.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So, knocking G2 out (g2) gives 0%—so it's worse than either g1 or g3. That suggests that G2 is more important than G1 or G3. So, G2 could be a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.

So, if G2 is a TF, then in g1, G1 is knocked out but G2 is present. So, the plant can still produce G2, which might activate other genes. But in g1, the resistance is 75%, which is lower than the wild-type. So, G1 might be a gene downstream of G2 (or perhaps not directly under G2's control, but contributes to the pathway).

Looking at the double mutants: when G2 is knocked out (g2), any double mutant with g2 is 0%. So, that suggests that when G2 is not present, the other genes can't compensate. So, G2 is upstream, and the others are downstream.

Wait, but in the double mutants where G2 is not involved (like g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is worse than both g1 (75) and g3 (50) alone. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, their combined effect is additive or more than either alone.

So, perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways that contribute to resistance. If you knock out both, you get a more severe phenotype.

But the question states that one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So, G2 is probably the transcription factor. Because
