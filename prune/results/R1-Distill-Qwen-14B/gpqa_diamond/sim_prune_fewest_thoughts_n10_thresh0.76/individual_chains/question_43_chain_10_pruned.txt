Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents. Let's break down the information given.

First, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Wait, meta means each is separated by two carbons, right? So if one is at position 1, the next meta would be at 3, and the third meta at 5? Or maybe I should imagine the positions differently.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Ortho means adjacent, so positions 2 and 6 for the carboxylic acid at position 1? Or wait, the carboxylic acid is one substituent, and the other two (OH and N(CH3)2) are ortho to it. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then OH and N(CH3)2 would be at positions 2 and 6.

Next, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is across the ring, so if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, methoxy would be at position 4.

Also, both the methoxy and the alcohol (OH) are ortho to the nitrile group (cyano). Hmm. So the nitrile is somewhere, and the methoxy (position 4) and OH (position 2) are ortho to it. So the nitrile must be at position 3 because positions 2 and 4 are adjacent to 3? Wait, no. If a substituent is ortho to the nitrile, the nitrile's position would be adjacent to those substituents.

Wait, let me try to visualize the benzene ring. Let's consider the carboxylic acid as the principal functional group since it's the suffix in the IUPAC name (benzoic acid). So the numbering starts from there.

Let me sketch a benzene ring with the carboxylic acid group in position 1. Then, the substituents ortho to it (positions 2 and 6) are OH and N(CH3)2. The para position (position 4) is OMe (methoxy).

Now, the other substituents are the carbaldehyde (CHO), the nitrile (CN), and all three are meta to each other. Wait, the question says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta. Oh, wait, no: the question says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano group are all meta to one another. So each of them is meta to the others.

Wait, that's confusing. Because if they are all meta to each other, each pair must be meta. So for example, if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, then the carbaldehyde would be in position 3 (meta to 1
