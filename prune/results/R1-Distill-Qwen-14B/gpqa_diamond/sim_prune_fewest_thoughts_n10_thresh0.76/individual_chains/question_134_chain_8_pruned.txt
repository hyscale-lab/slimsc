Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and bases are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 being mixed. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but I need to check the options here.

Wait, the options are in both kcal and kJ. Oh right, sometimes enthalpy is given per mole of reaction. So I need to find out which reactants are in excess and which are limiting. Because the neutralization depends on the mole ratios.

First, let me write down the possible reactions. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

HCl will donate H+ ions. H2SO4, since it's a diprotic acid, will donate 2 H+ ions per molecule. Ba(OH)2, being a strong base, will provide 2 OH- ions per formula unit.

So when these react, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base to form water.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

For HCl: 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L) multiplied by 0.2 mol/L. That's 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Each HCl gives one H+, so that's 0.1 moles H+.

For H2SO4: it's 0.3 L (300 mL) times 0.3 mol/L. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from HCl and H2SO4 is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base is Ba(OH)2. Let's find the moles of OH- it provides. The formula is Ba(OH)2, which gives 2 OH- per formula unit. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 L (200 mL) times 0.5 mol/L. 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, the reaction between H+ and OH- is 1:1. So the H+ from the acids is 0.28 moles, and the OH- is 0.2 moles.

But wait, which is the limiting reactant here? The OH- is 0.2 and H+ is 0.28. So OH- is the limiting reagent because it's less. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will be left.

So the neutralization reaction will use 0.2 moles of H+ (since each OH- takes one H+ to make H2O). The enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about 57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), because when you neutralize 1 mole of H+ with OH-, you get about -57 kJ (exothermic). But wait, sometimes it's given per mole of acid or base. Wait, for strong acids and bases, the enthalpy change is around -57 kJ per mole of H+.

But wait, the reaction is H+ + OH-
