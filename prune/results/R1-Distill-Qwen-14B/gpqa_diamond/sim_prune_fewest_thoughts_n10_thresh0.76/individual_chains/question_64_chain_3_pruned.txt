Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to walk through it step by step. I'll take it slow and see if I can figure it out.

Alright, the problem is about a mixture of two salts, A and B, which are heated. The setup is a bit involved, so I'll try to break it down.

First, the setup: an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, is heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. This gas is passed through several tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are 13, 15, 17, or 19. Hmm.

So, let's think about what each of these steps does.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong dehydrating agent and can trap water vapor. So when the gas mixture passes through, if there's water vapor, it would be absorbed, increasing the weight of tube 1. So, the 3.60g increase is probably the mass of water (since Mg(ClO4)2 would take up the water as it's anhydrous). So, the water formed from the decomposition of the salts.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2, forming CaCO3 and water. But in the problem, the weight of tube 2 doesn't change. That suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. Because if there were CO2, it would react, and the solution would gain mass. So, the absence of change in tube 2 implies no CO2 was present.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. So this setup is likely for the reduction of NO3^- to something else. Wait, but wait. Red-hot copper would typically be used to remove oxygen or to react with certain gases. Oh, right, in gas analysis, if the gas is NO or NO2, copper can react. Let me think. Copper at high temperatures can react with NO2 to form Cu(NO3)2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a mixture of H2 and O2, but that's less likely.

Wait, but the gas after tube 3 is 2.24 liters at STP. STP is 0°C and 1 atm, so 22.4 L per mole. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles. That's the amount of gas C that remains.

Let me think about the possible gases. Since tube 2 didn't react, no CO2, so the gas isn't carbon dioxide. The fact that tube 1 only absorbed water suggests that the initial gases released might have H2O vapor, but upon heating, perhaps the salts decomposed into gases that don't react with Mg(ClO4)2 except for water.

Wait, so the gas that passed through tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) would have any water vapor absorbed, increasing the tube's mass by 3.60g. So the water is 3.60g.

Then, the gas that passed into tube 2 is dry, because the Mg(ClO4)2 would have removed the water. But since tube 2's Ca(OH)2 didn't react, the gas doesn't have CO2. So what's left?

Then the gas passes through tube 3, which is red-hot copper. The only thing
