Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Right, where n_i and n_j are the populations of states i and j, g is the statistical weight, and k is the Boltzmann constant.

In this problem, the energy levels are the same for both stars, so E_i - E_j is the same delta E, which is 1.38e-23 J. The statistical weights g_i and g_j are probably the same for both stars because it's the same transition in iron atoms. So the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) for star 1 is twice that of star 2. Let me write that down.

So for star 1: n1_i/n1_j = 2.
For star 2: n2_i/n2_j = let's call this x. But wait, the problem says in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So star_1's excitation is higher. So maybe n1_i / n1_j = 2*(n2_i / n2_j), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the ratio for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2. Wait, no, the problem says "twice as excited". So n1_i is twice n2_i, given that n_j is the same? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe the ratio is the key here.

Wait, the exact statement: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". So the excitation level is twice as much. So that implies that the ratio n_i/n_j for star 1 is twice that of star 2.

So (n1_i/n1_j) = 2*(n2_i/n2_j). But since both stars have the same E_i - E_j (since it's the same transition energy), and same g_i and g_j, the equation would be:

(n1_i/n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - deltaE/(k T1) )

Similarly for star 2:

(n2_i/n2_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - deltaE/(k T2) )

So taking the ratio of the two equations: [n1_i/n1_j] / [n2_i/n2_j] = [ (g_i/g_j) exp(-deltaE/(k T1)) ) ] / [ (g_i/g_j) exp(-deltaE/(k T2)) ) ]

The g_i/g_j terms cancel out, so:

ratio = exp( ( -deltaE/(
