Okay, so I have this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because when you have equal probabilities for both states |0> and |1>, the density matrix becomes a mixture of the two projectors, each multiplied by 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that qubits can be represented as points on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere gives a geometric representation of the state of a qubit. Each state |ψ> can be written as a vector (x, y, z), where the components correspond to the angles in the Bloch sphere.

But wait, the density matrix here is a mixed state, not a pure state. So how does that translate geometrically? Oh right, for a pure state, the density matrix is a rank-1 projector, and on the Bloch sphere, it's a point on the surface. For a mixed state, the density matrix is a statistical mixture, and it's represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere. The further the point is from the origin, the more mixed the state is, but wait no, actually the more mixed a state is, the closer it is to the origin. Because for a completely mixed state, the density matrix is (I/2), which I think is at the origin when considering the Bloch vector representation.

Wait, the Bloch vector for a qubit state is given by (x, y, z) where x = <σ_x>, y = <σ_y>, z = <σ_z>. For the density matrix ρ, the expectation value of σ_i is Tr(ρ σ_i).

So let's compute each component.

First, the Pauli matrices:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The density matrix ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let's write that out.

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I.

So ρ is (1/2) I. So when we compute Tr(ρ σ_i), for each σ_i, we get Tr( (1/2 I ) σ_i ) = (1/2) Tr(σ_i) = (1/2) * 0, because the trace of any Pauli matrix is zero. Because Tr(σ_x) = 0, same for σ_y and σ_z.

So the expectation values for all the Pauli matrices are zero. That would give x=0, y=0, z=0. So the Bloch vector is (0,0,0). That's the origin.

Wait, but I thought that the completely mixed state is represented at the center of the Bloch sphere. Yes, that makes sense because it's maximally uncertain. So in this case, the density matrix is the maximally mixed state, so its Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the probabilities of the states \( \left|0\right\rangle \) and \( \left|1\right\rangle \) are equal. In the Bloch sphere representation, mixed states are represented as points inside the sphere, with the origin corresponding to the completely mixed state.

To determine the geometrical position of this density matrix, we compute the Bloch vector \( (x, y, z) \), where \( x = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) \), \( y = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) \), and \( z = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) \). The Pauli matrices are:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The density matrix \( \rho \) is \( \frac{1}{2} I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. The trace of \( \rho \sigma_i \) for any Pauli matrix \( \sigma_i \) is \( \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_i) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}(\sigma_i) \). Since the trace of any Pauli matrix is zero, we find \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 0 \). Thus, the Bloch vector is \( (0, 0, 0) \), which corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere.

The origin represents the completely mixed state, consistent with the maximally mixed nature of \( \rho \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.**  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different state.**  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \): Correct, as this is the origin and represents the maximally mixed state.**  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid qubit state.**

Answer: C
