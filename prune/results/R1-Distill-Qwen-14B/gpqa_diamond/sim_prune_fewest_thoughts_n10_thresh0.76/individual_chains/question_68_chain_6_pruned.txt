Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So, the problem is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Hmm. I remember that spin systems can be described using quantum mechanics, particularly with the spin operators. The magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field, and the energy levels depend on the spin orientation relative to the field.

Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along +Z. Since the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, the energy levels would be proportional to Sz. So, the spin is aligned along Z, meaning it's in an eigenstate of Sz. So the spin state is either up or down along Z.

But then, the field is suddenly switched off and another along +Y is turned on. Wait, so the field direction changes from Z to Y. The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment.

I think this is a problem involving time evolution under a different Hamiltonian. Let me recall: when a system's Hamiltonian changes, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state is an eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian, but after the change, it becomes a state under the new Hamiltonian.

The initial state, when the field was along Z, is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say the initial state is |up_z> or |down_z>, but given the problem says the field is along +Z, and the magnetic moment is aligned, so the spin is in the up_z state. Because mu is aligned with B, which implies the lowest energy state, so that's probably the ground state.

Wait, but if the particle is spin 1/2, it can be in either up or down. But the problem says it's aligned with the field, so it's in the up_z state. So the initial state is |+z> before the field change.

After the field is switched to +Y, the new Hamiltonian would be H = -mu·B. Wait, no, actually, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz, and the energy is H = -mu·B. But wait, I might have to think about the signs. Let me get this right.

The potential energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is U = - mu · B. But in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is usually given as H = -mu · B. Alternatively, perhaps H is proportional to the magnetic moment operator times the field. Wait, let me think. The energy levels are given by E = -mu·B. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to spin, mu = gamma Sz, so E = -gamma Sz B.

Wait, but let's get the sign right. The energy should be E = -mu · B. So H = -mu · B, but mu is gamma times Sz, so H = -gamma Sz B. But wait, the direction of the field is along Y. So the new Hamiltonian after the field is turned on in Y-direction is H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = -γ B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. So for B along Y, H = -gamma B S_y. But wait, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction.

Wait, but the initial state is a spin eigenstate along Z, so |+z> or |−z>. Now, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. So the state will no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

In such cases, the state will evolve with time according to the new Hamiltonian. The time evolution of the state is given by the
