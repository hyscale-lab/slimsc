Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves three reactions starting with toluene. Each step forms a new product, and finally, we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product 3. The options given are A) cs, B) d2h, C) c2h, D) c3. I'm a bit rusty on my point groups, so I'll need to remember what each stands for.

First, let's outline each reaction step.

Step 1: Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). I remember that nitration typically occurs when nitric acid acts as the nitrating agent, especially in the presence of a strong acid like sulfuric acid. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. The nitration of toluene should occur at the meta position because the methyl group is an activating group, but wait, no—wait, methyl is an activating group, so the nitration would be at the ortho and para positions relative to the methyl group. Wait, no, wait: the methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the nitration would add a nitro group in the ortho, meta, or para positions. Wait, no: toluene's methyl directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions. So when you nitrate toluene, you get a nitro group in either the ortho or para positions. But which is major? I think the para product is more stable and thus major, so Product 1 should be para-nitrotoluene, which is 4-nitrophenyl methyl.

Wait, but wait—toluene's nitration is more likely to give the para product as the major product because of the stability of the nitration intermediate. So Product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I'm trying to remember what reaction occurs when nitrotoluenes are treated with MnO2 in sulfuric acid. Oh right, that's the Hock rearrangement. The Hock rearrangement occurs when a nitro group is present on a methyl-substit
