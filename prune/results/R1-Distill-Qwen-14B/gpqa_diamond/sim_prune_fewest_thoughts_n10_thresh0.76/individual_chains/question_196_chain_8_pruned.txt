Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm... I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed determined by the amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are a bit different. Let me think.

The question gives the mass m and maximum amplitude A, and says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh right, in the relativistic case, the equations change because of the Lorentz factor.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a spring, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but I don't know if that's the answer here because it's relativistic.

But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in this case would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but since we're dealing with a harmonic oscillator, the total energy might be the sum of potential and kinetic.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the
