Okay, so I have this question about the color of light absorbed by a textile dye. Hmm, I remember that when an object absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it reflects the complementary color. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not the color emitted or seen. Oh right, because when a dye absorbs a particular wavelength, it doesn't reflect that, so the color we see is the complement.

The question states that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, emission is when the dye gives off light, right? But the question is about what it absorbs. Oh, because in some cases, maybe it's talking about the absorption spectrum determining the emission. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

So, in fluorescence or phosphorescence, when a substance absorbs light (a certain energy), it emits light of a lower energy. So the energy of the emitted light is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed energy is higher. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher than that.

Wait, but how do I find the wavelength from the energy? Oh right, energy (eV) and wavelength (nm) are related by the equation E = hc/λ. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Let's see, h is 4.135667696 × 10^-15 eV·s, c is 2.99792458 × 10^8 m/s. So E = (4.135667696e
