Okay, so I've got this question about the density matrix of a qubit, and I'm trying to figure out where it's located geometrically in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, I think this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because |0><0| and |1><1| are projectors onto the computational basis states, and when you average them with equal weights, it's a completely mixed state. 

But the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I remember that for qubits, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize quantum states, where pure states are points on the surface, and mixed states are inside. 

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The density matrix is usually expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So, when I expand ρ, it should match this form. 

Let me write out ρ explicitly. |0><0| is the matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0, 1]]. Wait, no, wait a second. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding those gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, multiplying by 1/2 gives ρ = (1/2) I. 

So ρ = I/2. Now, comparing this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. If I set (I + r·σ)/2 equal to I/2, then the equation becomes (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives (r·σ)/2 = 0. That implies r·σ = 0, so r must be a zero vector. 

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So for the vector r = (r_x, r_y, r_z), the term r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. So if r is all zeros, then r·σ is zero, and the density matrix is I/2. 

So in Bloch sphere terms, the state is at the origin. Because the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which is the center of the sphere. But wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? So a mixed state would be a statistical mixture and would be inside the sphere. Since this is a maximally mixed state, it's as far from being pure as possible. 

So the geometrical position is at the origin in the qubit space, which would correspond to the point (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). 

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the purity of the state. The purity is Tr(ρ²). Let's calculate that. ρ squared is (I/2)^2 = I²/4 = I/4. Tr(I/4) is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Since purity is 1/2, it's a mixed state. The maximum purity is 1 (for pure states), and 0.5 is the minimal, which again points to the maximally mixed state. 

So the density matrix represents a completely mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the coordinates are (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( \mathbf{r} \) is the Bloch vector and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given density matrix, we see that \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} I \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbf{r} \) must be the zero vector, corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

This state is a mixed state with purity \( \text{Tr}(\rho^2) = \frac{1}{2} \), which is the minimal purity for a single qubit, confirming it is maximally mixed. Geometrically, this places the state at the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the coordinates \( (0,0,0) \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
