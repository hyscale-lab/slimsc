Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvalues are really important because they correspond to the possible energy levels a system can have.

The problem states that the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Here, σ is the Pauli vector, which are the Pauli spin matrices. Oh wait, wait. So σ is a vector made up of the Pauli matrices, right? Like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is a unit vector, so it's in some direction in space. And ε is just a constant with energy dimension.

I think the key here is to figure out what the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are. I remember that the eigenvalues of a spin operator depend on the direction of the magnetic field or the spin component. Wait, because when you have a spin in a magnetic field along a particular direction, the energy levels are proportional to the spin component in that direction.

Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. So the operator σ · n is the dot product of the Pauli vector with the unit vector n. So σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Right. So the Hamiltonian H is ε times this sum.

Wait, but when you have σ · n, each component of σ is a Pauli matrix. So let's think about the eigenvalues of σ · n. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when we take a linear combination like σ · n, where n is a unit vector, what are the eigenvalues?

I recall that the trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. The trace of σ · n would be the sum of the eigenvalues. But since n is a unit vector, σ · n is a traceless matrix because each Pauli matrix is traceless. So the sum of eigenvalues should be zero. So the two eigenvalues must be +a and -a for some a. So the eigenvalues are a and -a for some a.

But wait, what is a? Since H is ε times σ · n, the eigenvalues of H would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. So I need to find the eigenvalues of σ · n first.

Let me think: σ · n is a matrix. Let's calculate its eigenvalues. The
