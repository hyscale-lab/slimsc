Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reaction sequence to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it better. So, the molecule is ethan-1-one attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene are a nitro group and a bromo group. Looking at the positions, the nitro is at the 5 position, and bromo at 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering is important. Let me imagine the benzene ring. If the ketone is at position 1 (since it's ethan-1-one), then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Oh wait, waitâ€”no, wait. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring has the ketone attached to the ethyl group at position 1. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment. So when looking at the benzene ring, the substituents would be in the meta positions relative to each other, but wait, 3 and 5 are two positions apart in the ring. So 3 and 5 are meta to each other when the ketone is at position 1.

So the benzene ring has the ketone (as part of ethan-1-one) attached at position 1. Then, position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. So the arrangement is 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). I think that's the structure.

Now, the challenge is to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let's think about the steps needed.

Starting from benzene, I'll need to introduce substituents in the correct order. Since nitration is a strong activating group, and bromination is a deactivating group, the order matters. Also, the ketone group is introduced via some kind of acylation.

Wait, ethan-1-one is acetophenone. So the benzene ring would have an acetyl group attached. So
