Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs catalyst typically facilitates ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis. But wait, what's the structure of the starting material here?

3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on carbon 3. Let's number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, double bond is between 1 and 2. Carbon 3 is CH(CH3). So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count again. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Pent means five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait. Carbon 1: CH₂=, then carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3 has a methyl group. So, structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons. No, wait, no. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3? That can't be right. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Now, adding a methyl group on C3. So, the structure would be
