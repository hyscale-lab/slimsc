Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about how the number of stars varies with distance. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Oh wait, parallax is related to distance, right? I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

Parallax formula: plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So plx is inversely proportional to r. So plx = k / r, where k is some constant. But since we're dealing with how N changes with r, maybe I can express N in terms of r.

Given N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in. So 1/( (1/r) )^5 = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but wait a second. Because when plx increases, number of stars decrease, which makes sense because nearby stars have higher parallax and you can see more, but maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If plx is inversely proportional to r, then plx = 1 / r. So if r increases, plx decreases. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Plugging plx = 1/r into N: N = (1) / ( (1/r)^5 ) = r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, right, so it's the differential—how N changes as you move in distance. So if N = kr^5, then the change in N with respect to r is dN/dr = 5kr^4. But the options are about the change per unit range, so it's like the rate of change of N with r. So the number of stars increases with r^5, so the rate would be proportional to r^4. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't include r^4 as the main answer for how N varies, but the question is about how it changes
