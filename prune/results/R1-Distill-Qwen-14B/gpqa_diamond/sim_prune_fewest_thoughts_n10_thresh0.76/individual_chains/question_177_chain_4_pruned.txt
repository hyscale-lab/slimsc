Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found the wavelengths where each star appears brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, wait, no, wait. Because the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So does that mean their peak emission wavelengths are the same? Because that's what Wien's Law would imply.

So if lambda_max is the same for both, then their temperatures are the same. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

But wait, the problem says they assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So we need to model them as such. The luminosity of a star (assuming black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the temperature.

So the luminosity depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power. Since both stars have the same temperature (as per the same peak wavelength), then the luminosity ratio will be (R1/R2)². Because T is the same, so T^4 cancels out.

Wait, but wait! The masses are given, but the mass doesn't directly affect the luminosity in this model. Unless perhaps if the mass affects the temperature somehow. But the question says they are using black body radiation, and the peak wavelengths are the same, so I think the temperatures are the same regardless of mass.

Wait, but mass might influence other properties, like radius. Oh, but in this problem, the radius is given as 1.5 times larger for Star_1. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2
