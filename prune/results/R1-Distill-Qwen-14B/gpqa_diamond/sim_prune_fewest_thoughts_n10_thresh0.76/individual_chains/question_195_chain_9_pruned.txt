Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again carefully.

Astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius in a circular orbit. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which has a radius 2.5 times Earth's, that will exhibit both transit and occultation events. The second planet also has a circular orbit and shares the same orbital plane.

Hmm, I think I remember that transit and occultation events depend on the orbital periods and the relative positions of the planets. Oh right, for a planet to both transit (when it passes in front of the star from our point of view) and occultate (when the star passes behind the planet from our point of view), their orbital periods must be such that their positions align correctly.

Wait, I think that for both events to happen, the orbital periods need to be in a rational ratio. Like, their periods have to be a ratio of small integers so that they periodically align. But I'm not exactly sure about the details, so I need to think more.

Transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star, and occultation is when the planet is behind the star relative to us. So the second planet must be in a position where both can occur, which probably means that its orbital period must be such that the two planets are in resonance or something.

But wait, no, I think the key is that the orbital periods must be such that the two planets are in the same orbital configuration periodically. So maybe the second planet's period has to be a divisor or a multiple of the first planet's period.

Alternatively, I've heard of the concept of conjunctions and oppositions. For us to see a transit, the planet must be in conjunction with the star (from our point of view). For occultation, it must be in opposition. So, for both events to occur, the orbital periods must allow for these positions to happen.

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the second planet relate to the first? Oh, right! If the planets are in a 2:1 orbital resonance, then the inner planet would orbit twice for every one orbit of the outer planet
