Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can figure out.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. Let me read it again.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. Hmm.

So, breaking this down. Let's start with the gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecular formula must be something where for each molecule, protons = neutrons. Let's think about possible gases.

Wait, the molecule itselfâ€”so if it's a diatomic gas, maybe? Let's think about common gases. Like H2, O2, N2, etc. But that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe a compound like CO2 or something else, but that's triatomic.

Wait, wait. The molecule's protons equal neutrons. So, for a molecule, the sum of all protons in the molecule equals the sum of all neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, CO2: carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. So each molecule would have 6 + 16 = 22 protons, and each atom's neutrons would be, carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, oxygen-16 has 8. So total neutrons: 6 + 8 = 14. Not equal. So 22 vs 14. Not equal. So CO2 might not be it.

Wait, maybe it's a molecule like NH3? No, that's a gas but not sure. Wait, when you have a monoatomic gas, like He, Ne, Ar, etc. Let's think: For He, it's just one atom. So He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, no. Helium has atomic number 2, so 2 protons. Its most common isotope is He-4, which has 2 neutrons. So each He atom has 2 pro
