Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path in a transmission electron microscope. Hmm, let me think.

So, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. He used vacuum pumps and achieved a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. But even then, some gas particles were left, as detected by a mass spectrometer. He determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. 

Mean free path, as I remember, depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. Oh right, the formula is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. 

Wait, but when he turned on the electron beam, the mean free path changed to λ2. The question says the temperature remained the same. So why would λ2 not be equal to λ1?

Oh, the key here is what happens when the electron beam is active. The electron beam has a high energy, right? At 1000 kV, that's a lot of energy. So the electrons are moving really fast. 

I think the mean free path for electrons would be different because electrons interact with the gas molecules in a different way. The mean free path for electrons (λ2) would be in the context of electron scattering, not the gas molecules scattering among themselves. 

Wait, but wait. The question says that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So why would that be? Oh, because when the electron beam is on, the electrons can cause ionization of the gas molecules. That makes the gas ions, which have different sizes and perhaps different interactions. 

Or maybe it's about electron scattering. The electrons are moving through the gas, so their mean free path would be affected by collisions with the gas molecules. The gas molecules are still present, but the electrons might have a different interaction. But wait, the initial λ1 was the mean free path of the gas molecules. So when Mike turned on the beam, it's about the electrons' mean free path, which is λ2.

Wait, no. The question isn't entirely clear. It says Mike observed that the mean free path was λ2. So he probably measured the mean free path from the electron scattering perspective. So in the initial state, without the
