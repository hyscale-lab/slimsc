Okay, so I'm looking at this question about qPCR and a calibration curve. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the scientist is making a calibration curve, which is a standard curve to quantify the amount of nucleic acid in samples. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and did serial dilutions. Each dilution has three technical replicates. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the reaction is perfect—so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, so the data is a perfect fit, which is great for a standard curve. The slope is -3.3, which is close to -3.32, the expected value for a 100% efficient reaction because the slope relates to log vs linear in the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope. So log(copy number) vs Ct.

Looking at the data:

At 100,000 copies: Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is about 34.2.

10,000 copies: Ct's 30.6-31.2. So average ~30.9.

1,000 copies: 27.3-27.9 → ~27.6.

100 copies: 24-24.6 → ~24.3.

10 copies: 20.7-21.3 → ~21.

Now, the question is about the discrepancies in the results. The options are A to D.

Option A: qPCR can't quantify. No way, because he's using it for quantification, and the efficiency is 100% with a perfect R². So A is incorrect.

Option B: Ct not in agreement with target. But wait, his Ct values decrease as the copy number increases, which is correct. Lower Ct means more DNA. So B seems incorrect because the Ct is in agreement.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Let's think. A ten-fold dilution should change the Ct by about 3.3 cycles because each 10x reduction halves the quantity (since 10x less would require 3.3 cycles—since 2^3.3 ≈ 10). So if each dilution is 10x, the Ct should go up by about 3.3 each time.

Looking at the data: From 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution. The Ct increases by about 3.3 (34.2 to 30.9? Wait wait, no—wait, the Ct is lower when concentration is lower. Oh wait, when concentration is higher, Ct is lower because DNA is abundant, so it reaches threshold sooner. So when he goes from 100,000 to 10,000 (which is a 10x lower concentration), the Ct should go up by 3.3. Let me check:

From 100,000 to 10,000: average Ct from 34.2 to 30.9. Wait, 34.2 minus 30.9 is 3.3. Oh wait no, wait: no, because higher concentration should give lower Ct. So 100,000 is higher; 10,000 is 10x less. So the Ct should be higher (takes more cycles to reach). So from 100,000 (34.2) to 10,000 (30.9): that's a decrease in Ct? That doesn't make sense. Wait no, wait, no—wait, that's impossible. Because 100,000 is a higher concentration than 10,000. So higher concentration should have lower Ct. Wait, 1
