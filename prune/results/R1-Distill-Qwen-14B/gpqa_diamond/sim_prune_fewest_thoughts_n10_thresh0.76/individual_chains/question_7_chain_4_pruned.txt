Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are in GeV, so I'll need to figure out the energy in terms of eV or something.

Wait, what's the process here? The reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. So high-energy gamma-rays are interacting with low-energy CMB photons. I remember that pair production from gamma-rays usually requires a threshold energy because you need enough energy to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. Oh right, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so together it's 1.022 MeV, but wait, no—because each has 0.511 MeV, so combined, 2*(0.511) = 1.022 MeV. So the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least that, right?

But wait, the CMB photons are much lower energy. So the gamma-ray's energy is high, and the CMB photon is low. How does that affect the threshold? Let me recall the formula for pair production in this scenario.

I think the condition for the reaction to be possible is that the product of the two photon energies (in their center-of-mass frame) is enough to produce the rest mass energy squared. So the threshold condition is when the center-of-mass energy is equal to twice the electron mass energy, which is 2*m_e*c². Wait, or wait, no. The rest mass energy for each particle is m_e c², so the total is 2 m_e c² = 1.022 MeV.

So the condition is that the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 1.022 MeV. But since the two photons are moving in opposite directions, the center-of-mass energy is given by sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2 ), but since they
