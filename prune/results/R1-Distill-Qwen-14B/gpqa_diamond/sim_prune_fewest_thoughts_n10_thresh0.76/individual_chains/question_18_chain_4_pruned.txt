Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if that's important for the elemental abundance part. Maybe it's just extra info.

The problem provides some abundance ratios using the EW method. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. And we're given the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, so that means log(nFe/nH)= -4.5. Wait, no, wait: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH= 10^-5 ≈ 3.16e-6.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star1] divided by [Si/Star2], maybe? Or perhaps (Si in Star1) / (Si in Star2).

Wait, but how do I find the silicon abundance in each star?

Let me make sense of the given data. [X/Y] is the logarithm of (X/Y ratio in the star) divided by (X/Y ratio in the Sun). So:

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 / (Si/Fe)_sun = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

And [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → same as Sun. So Fe abundance is same as Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/Si)_sun * 10^0.3 ≈ 2 * (Mg/Si in sun).

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → Mg/H ratio same as sun.

Wait, maybe I should find the [Si/H] for each star.

Let me start with Star_1.

In Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun. So nFe/nH = same as Sun: 3.16e-5.
