Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist did two reactions with two different reducing agents. The products are both (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one), but one is the R configuration and the other is S. The options give different starting materials for A and B.

Hmm, so the starting materials are reacting with either LiBH4 and H+ or BH3 and H+. Wait, wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones and aldehydes, right? And BH3 is also a reducing agent, but I think it's part of the hydroboration reaction, maybe in a different context. Wait, no, wait—BH3 is often used in the BH3-THF (tetrahydrofuran) complex for hydroboration of alkenes. Oh wait, but in the presence of H+, which probably leads to the formation of an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the products are ketones, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, but pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So the starting materials must be something that upon reduction would form a ketone? That doesn't make sense because reducing a ketone would give an alcohol, not form another ketone. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides or some other structures that upon reduction form a specific configuration of a carbonyl group. Or wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides which are being opened to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, let me think again. The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The pyran ring is six-membered, with the ketone at position 2. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, a carbonyl group at C2, and an ethyl group at C4.

Wait, but where does that come from? Maybe the starting materials are some kind of epoxide that upon ring-opening forms the ketone. But if that's the case, then the reducing agents might be involved in the ring-opening.

Wait, another angle: The products are R and S configurations, so the starting materials must have certain configurations that lead to these upon reduction. Oh, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of epoxides, and the reducing agents are opening them with different stereochemistry.

Wait, or maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters or something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are ketones or aldehydes that, upon some kind of reduction, form a new structure. Hmm... I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me look at the options. The options are all compounds A and B. Both are (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid) but with R and S configurations.

Wait, so A and B are two enantiomers? Or diastereomers? Because the options vary between R and S configurations.

The reaction conditions for A are LiBH4 and H+. For B, it's BH3 and H+. So perhaps the type of reducing agent affects the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces carbonyl groups. But wait, BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which are typically for alkenes, but under certain conditions, maybe for carbonyl reductions as well? Or maybe this is a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents are opening them. For example, when an epoxide is treated with a reducing agent, it can open to form a diol or something else. Hmm, but the product is a ketone. Maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, and the ring opens to form a carbonyl group. Or perhaps it's a cyclic ketone derivative, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are esters or other carbonyl-containing compounds. Let's think: When you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, and you reduce it with LiBH4, you get an alcohol. But the product here is a ketone, so that would mean the product is another ketone. That doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a ketone that is in a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So, for example, if you have a cyclic ester (lactone), which upon opening (like with a reducing agent) forms a diol, but that doesn't connect to the product given.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a hemiacetal or acetal, and the reduction leads to the formation of a ketone. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone which, upon treatment with a reducing agent, undergoes some kind of ring-forming reaction. But that seems a bit off.

Another approach: let's think about the product. The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The structure would be O in the ring, and the ketone is at position 2. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a diol, and the reaction forms the cyclic ketone via an elimination. But the presence of two different reducing agents complicates that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents cause them to open in a way that forms the ketone.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible reactions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, and aldehydes to primary alcohols. But I don't see how that leads to the product being a ketone. Unless perhaps the starting material is an ester, like a cyclic ester, and the LiBH4 reduces it to an alcohol, which then loses water to form a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, and the reducing agent is causing ring-opening to form a diol, which then undergoes some kind of elimination to form the ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. When epoxides react with reducing agents like LiBH4, they might open in a certain way. Wait, I remember that epoxides can open under acidic conditions to form diols, but what about under reducing conditions?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketones, and the reducing agents are affecting their configuration. But that doesn't make sense because reducing a ketone would lead to an alcohol, not another ketone.

Another thought: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketals. When the ketals are treated with a reducing agent, such as LiBH4, they might be cleaved to form carbonyl groups. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which are more about adding boron to double bonds. But when BH3 is used in the presence of a proton source, like H+, maybe it's part of a different process.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides with substituents that allow for diastereoselective ring-opening. For example, when an epoxide is opened with a nucleophile, the nucleophile can attack either the more substituted or less substituted carbon, leading to different products.

But in the case of BH3, perhaps it's acting as a Lewis acid, helping in the ring-opening. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) that are being opened. But then, how would LiBH4 and BH3 affect that?

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the product's configuration. The product is (R)-4-ethyl... and (S)-4-ethyl... So the configuration at the chiral center (C4) is what's determining the R and S.

That suggests that the starting material has a certain configuration that affects the product's configuration upon reaction. Since the reagents are different (LiBH4 and BH3), the way the starting material is reduced leads to different stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, but how does the reduction step lead to the formation of a specific configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the ring-opening is influenced by the reducing agents, leading to different stereochemistry.

Wait, for example, in epoxide ring-opening, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon (if it's via acid-catalyzed mechanism, like with H+). But if the nucleophile is something else, like from BH3, perhaps it affects the attack.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is usually for hydroboration. Maybe in this case, the reaction is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketones, and the reducing agents cause different stereochemical outcomes in their reduction.

Wait, but reducing a ketone would give an alcohol. So how does that lead to a cyclic ketone? That doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals or something, and the reduction leads to cleavage to form a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters or something similar. Let me think, if you have an ester that upon reduction forms an alcohol, but again, I'm not connecting it to the product.

Wait, another angle: the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, perhaps the starting material is a diol, which upon treatment with an acid or base forms the cyclic ketone via elimination. But I'm not sure how the reducing agents fit in.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and the reducing agents cause them to form the diol, which then cyclizes to form the ketone. But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are some kind of cyclic ethers that upon treatment with H+ and a reducing agent form the ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement. Pinacol is a diol that, upon treatment with acid, loses water to form a ketone. But in that case, the starting material would be a diol, and the product a ketone. But I'm not sure if the reducing agents are involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are ketones that are part of a cyclic structure, which upon reduction form a different cyclic structure. Wait, but that's unclear.

Another thought: Maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones with substituents, and the reducing agents affect their substituents. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that are being opened to form diols, and then the diols undergo elimination to form the cyclic ketone. But then, the reagents might influence the configuration of the diol, which in turn affects the configuration of the ketone.

But how? Let's think. If the epoxide is opened in a way that the stereochemistry of the diol is determined by the reagent, then the diol could form the ketone in a certain configuration.

Let me imagine that. Suppose the starting material is an epoxide. When you treat it with a reducing agent, perhaps the attack occurs in a way that depends on the reagent.

Wait, but I'm not clear on how LiBH4 and BH3 would open an epoxide. Maybe BH3 is a Lewis acid that helps in the opening.

Wait, perhaps in the case of LiBH4, the epoxide ring opens via a nucleophilic attack, with borohydride acting as a nucleophile, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are something else. Let's go back to the options.

The options are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure would be pentanoic acid with substituents: at position 3, ethyl; at position 5, isobutoxy and oxo groups.

Wait, 5-oxopentanoic acid would be CH2CH2-CO-COOH? No, wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So 5-oxo would be at the end. So structure would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-O-isobutyl?

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to draw the structure.

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait. Pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So 3-ethyl would be at carbon 3, which is the third carbon from the COOH.

So structure: COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-isobutyl)-something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, the formula is CH2CH2-C(=O)-O-... Wait, maybe the structure is:

The acid is pentanoic acid, so five carbons in the chain. 3-ethyl means an ethyl group on carbon 3. 5-isobutoxy and 5-oxo: so on carbon 5, there's an oxygen with an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group. So carbon 5 would have a carbonyl group and an isobutoxy group attached.

Wait, but carbon 5 in a pentanoic acid is the last carbon, right? Because the chain is COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but then 5-oxo would mean the last carbon (carbon 5) has a ketone. But that's not possible because the last carbon in pentanoic acid is CH3, so if it's 5-oxo, it's a ketone at the end, which would make it not a carboxylic acid anymore. Hmm, maybe the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is: the main chain is five carbons, with the COOH at the end. Carbon 3 has an ethyl group. Carbon 5 has an oxo group (a ketone) and an isobutoxy group.

Wait, that sounds a bit complicated. Let me think: the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-isobutyl?

Wait, but the position 5 is the fifth carbon. So the chain is:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(CH2CH2CH3)

4: C(O)

5: O-isobutyl?

Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

At position 3: ethyl group.

At position 5: both an oxo group (O) and an isobutoxy group (O-...). So the carbon 5 has two substituents: an oxygen (as in a ketone) and an isobutoxy group. Wait, but that carbon can't have two oxygens. Unless it's a cyclic structure.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester or something else. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps that's not necessary right now.

The key point is that A and B are reacting with different reducing agents to form the same product but with opposite configurations (R and S).

So, the configuration at a certain center in the product is determined by the configuration of the starting material and the reaction's mechanism.

Since the product is a cyclic ketone, with an ethyl group at position 4 and the ketone at position 2, the configuration at C4 would determine R or S.

Now, the starting materials are the same except for their configuration, as per the options. So for A and B, the starting materials are enantiomers.

So, when A (say, (S)-configuration) is treated with LiBH4, it gives (R)-product. And when B (the (R) form) is treated with BH3, it gives (S)-product. Or something like that.

But how does the reducing agent influence the stereochemistry?

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the ring-opening is stereospecific. For example, in acid-catalyzed opening of an epoxide, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon. But perhaps when using different reducing agents, the attack occurs differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) that upon reduction form a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the reagents again.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, known to reduce esters to alcohols. BH3, on the other hand, is used in hydroboration reactions, which typically add boron to the less substituted end of an alkene, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition. But in this problem, the reactions are leading to a ketone, so perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that are being opened to form an alcohol, which then loses water to form a ketone.

Wait, but if the starting material is an epoxide and it's treated with a reducing agent, perhaps it's a different process.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal. For example, if you have an acetal, reducing it with LiBH4 might break the acetal and form an alcohol, which then could form a ketone under certain conditions. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the starting materials could be esters or ketals. When treated with LiBH4, they might be reduced to form alcohols, which then form the cyclic ketone through elimination.

But I'm not exactly sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and when treated with LiBH4, they open to form a diol, which then cyclizes to form the cyclic ketone. The stereochemistry of the diol would depend on the way the epoxide opens, which could be influenced by the reducing agent.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Another thought: The product is a cyclic ketone, which suggests that the starting material might have a ring that, upon reduction, forms the ketone. Or perhaps the starting material is a diol that upon elimination forms the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol, and the reaction forms the cyclic ketone via elimination. But how does the reduction fit in?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers that are reduced to form diols, which then eliminate to form the ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. When LiBH4 is used, it could reduce the epoxide to a diol. Then, when acid is added, the diol loses water to form the ketone.

But then, the stereochemistry of the diol would influence the configuration of the ketone.

So, for example, if the epoxide opens to form a diol with a certain configuration, that diol would then form the ketone with R or S configuration.

But how does the reagent (LiBH4 vs BH3) affect the opening of the epoxide?

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. I don't think it typically opens epoxides on its own. BH3 might act as a Lewis acid, perhaps in a different way.

Alternatively, maybe the reducing agents are involved in different mechanisms of epoxide ring-opening.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the problem again.

We have two reactions:

Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

The options are for what A and B are.

The product is the same compound but with R and S configurations.

Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must have opposite configurations in a certain center, leading to the opposite configurations in the product.

Now, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations (R or S).

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that, upon reduction, forms a diol which cyclizes to form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't fit because the product is a ketone.

Wait, another thought: the starting materials are acyclic ketones with certain stereocenters, and the reduction with different reagents leads to different configurations in the product.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reducing strengths and mechanisms. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is less so and is often used in more selective reductions.

Wait, but both reactions are leading to ketones, so perhaps the starting materials are not ketones but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are epoxides, and their ring-opening leads to the formation of the ketone via some elimination.

Another thought: The product is a cyclic ketone with four substituents. So, in the ring, the substituents are arranged in a way that the configuration is determined by how the ring forms.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diol, and when treated with acid, it loses water to form the cyclic ketone.

But then, why are the reagents LiBH4 and BH3 used?

Wait, perhaps the diol is formed from an epoxide that's opened by the reducing agents. So, for example, the epoxide could be opened by LiBH4 to form a diol, which then under acidic conditions forms the cyclic ketone.

But I'm not certain about the exact mechanism.

Another angle: The starting material is a ketone with a neighboring group that can form a ring upon elimination. For example, in a cyclic hemiacetal, reducing it could form an alcohol, which then forms the ketone upon elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are gamma-lactones, which upon reduction form diols that then lose water to form the cyclic ketone.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to think about the stereochemistry.

The product has R and S configurations. That suggests that the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration.

Assuming that when A is treated with LiBH4, it forms the R product, and when B is treated with BH3, it forms the S product.

So, perhaps the reducing agents cause different stereochemical outcomes in the formation of the product.

Wait, but how?

Maybe the reducing agents affect the way the starting material's stereocenter is transformed into the product's stereocenter.

For example, if the starting material is an S configuration, using LiBH4 leads to R in the product, and using BH3 leads to S in the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is influenced by the reagent's ability to induce inversion or retain configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the ring-opening leads to the diol with a certain configuration, which then forms the ketone with R or S configuration.

Assuming that the epoxide opening is stereospecific, the configuration of the starting material would affect the configuration of the diol, which in turn affects the configuration of the ketone upon cyclization.

So, suppose the starting material is an epoxide with a certain configuration. When treated with LiBH4, the ring opens to form a diol with a specific configuration. Then, acid treatment leads to elimination to form the ketone, which would have a specific configuration based on the diol.

Similarly, when the same epoxide is treated with BH3, the ring-opening could happen differently, leading to a different diol configuration and a different ketone configuration.

But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are not epoxides but something else, like cyclic ketals.

Wait, another thought: The starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones). When treated with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could lose water to form the cyclic ketone.

Similarly, when treated with BH3, perhaps the same thing happens, but with a different stereochemical outcome.

So, the configuration of the starting material (the lactone) would influence the configuration of the diol, which in turn influences the configuration of the ketone.

But I'm not certain how LiBH4 and BH3 would affect the stereochemistry differently.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and would likely break open the lactone to form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol would depend on the configuration of the lactone.

Similarly, BH3 might not reduce the lactone as effectively, or perhaps the mechanism is different, leading to a different diol configuration.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides with an ester group. When treated with LiBH4, the epoxide opens to form a diol, and the ester is also reduced to an alcohol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could lose water to form the ketone.

But I'm not exactly certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals. When reduced, they form diols, which cyclize to form the ketone.

But again, I'm not exactly sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the options provided. The options are all the same compound but with R and S configurations for A and B.

So, options C and D have A and B as different enantiomers. Options A and B have A and B as the same configuration.

Since the products are R and S, the starting materials must have opposite configurations.

Looking at the options, options C and D have A and B as different (C: A is S, B is R; D: A is R, B is S).

So, the correct answer is either C or D.

Now, which reaction would lead to which product.

Assuming that when the starting material is S, treatment with LiBH4 leads to R product, and when starting with R and treating with BH3 leads to S product.

Alternatively, perhaps when using LiBH4, the configuration is inverted, and when using BH3, it's retained.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, and the ring-opening is influenced by the reducing agent's ability to attack from a certain face.

For example, LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to cause a certain type of ring-opening (maybe via a certain mechanism), leading to the R configuration, while BH3 causes a different attack, leading to S.

But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration based on the reaction's stereoselectivity.

Wait, let's think about the product's configuration.

The product is (R)-4-ethyl... when A is treated with LiBH4. So, if A's configuration is S, then LiBH4's reaction leads to R. Alternatively, if A is R, it gives R, but that would require retention.

Wait, but that's not necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the opposite configuration.

So, if A is (S), and the reaction inverts the configuration, it would lead to (R) product. Similarly, if B is (R), and the reaction inverts again, it would lead to (S) product.

But I'm not certain if the reaction inverts or retains.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction adds a group in a way that determines the configuration.

Wait, another thought: If the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a certain configuration, and the reduction leads to the diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone.

The configuration of the diol would depend on the starting material's configuration and the reducing agent.

So, for example, when the lactone is reduced, the stereochemistry at certain centers is set, which then translates into the ketone's configuration.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging to determine.

Wait, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and would cause different stereochemical outcomes than BH3.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of an intermediate that has a certain configuration based on the starting material.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a boronate intermediate, which then leads to the product's configuration. For example, in hydroboration reactions, the boron adds to the less substituted carbon, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition.

If the starting material has a certain configuration, the addition of boron would occur on a specific face, leading to the product's configuration.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a certain configuration, and the reducing agent affects the way the hydrogen is added, leading to R or S configuration.

But that doesn't make sense because reducing a ketone would form an alcohol, not a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and when reduced with LiBH4, they form alcohols that then form the ketone via elimination.

But again, I'm not certain.

At this point, I think I've thought through a lot, but I'm not making much progress. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

The correct answer is either option C or D because A and B must be enantiomers. Now, I need to determine which reagent (LiBH4 or BH3) leads to which configuration.

Assuming that the reaction using LiBH4 leads to the R configuration when the starting material is S, and the reaction using BH3 leads to S when the starting material is R.

So, for reaction 1: A (S) with LiBH4 → R product.

Reaction 2: B (R) with BH3 → S product.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So, reaction 1: R starting material with LiBH4 would produce R product. Reaction 2: S starting material with BH3 would produce S product. That would match the given products.

Wait, but that doesn't fit. Because the product is R when A is treated with LiBH4. So if A is R and treated with LiBH4, product is R.

But in the question, reaction 1's product is R. So if A is S, and LiBH4 leads to R, then that would mean that LiBH4 is causing inversion.

Similarly, if B is R, and treated with BH3 leads to S product, that would also be inversion.

So, perhaps each reagent causes inversion of configuration.

But then, looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S.

Reaction 1: A (R) + LiBH4 → R product (since inversion would lead to S, which does not match the product). Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagent's effect depends on the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention, while BH3 leads to inversion.

But without knowing, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material directly leads to the product's configuration when using LiBH4, and the opposite when using BH3.

So, for reaction 1: A is S → product R (so opposite configuration).

Reaction 2: B is R → product S (opposite configuration).

So, in this case, the reagents cause inversion.

Therefore, the starting materials must be the enantiomers of the product.

So, the product is R, so the starting material must be S when treated with LiBH4, and the product is S when the starting material is R when treated with BH3.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R, B as S. So, reaction 1: A (R) treated with LiBH4 → product R? But earlier I thought it would be inversion, giving S.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration is the same as the product's. So, reaction 1: starting material R → product R.

But the product is R, so A must be R, and treated with LiBH4.

Similarly, reaction 2: starting material S → product S.

So, in that case, the starting materials would be the same configuration as the products but in opposite.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has A as S, B as R.

So, reaction 1: A is S, treated with LiBH4 → product R.

Reaction 2: B is R, treated with BH3 → product S.

So, in this scenario, each reagent inverts the configuration.

Thus, the correct option would be C: A is S, B is R.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is:

C) A = (S)-..., B = (R)-...

So, reaction 1: S treated with LiBH4 → R.

Reaction 2: R treated with BH3 → S.

Which matches the products.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves two reactions where different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, are used to reduce two enantiomeric starting materials, A and B, to form the same product, (4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one), but with opposite configurations: (R) and (S). The goal is to determine the correct starting materials (A and B) from the given options.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H⁺ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one  
   - Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H⁺ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one  

   The product configurations (R and S) suggest that the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents influence the stereochemical outcome.

2. **Starting Materials**:  
   The starting materials are enantiomers:  
   - A = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid  
   - B = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid  

3. **Role of Reducing Agents**:  
   - LiBH4 and BH3 likely influence the stereochemistry of the product.  
   - The stereochemical outcome depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent used.  

4. **Product Configurations**:  
   - When A (S) is treated with LiBH4, it forms the (R)-configured product.  
   - When B (R) is treated with BH3, it forms the (S)-configured product.  

   This indicates that the reducing agents cause inversion of configuration during the reaction.

5. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This is incorrect because the starting materials must be enantiomers to produce opposite configurations in the products.  
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option C**: A = (S), B = (R). This matches the required stereochemical relationship.  
     - Reaction 1: (S)-A with LiBH4 produces (R)-product.  
     - Reaction 2: (R)-B with BH3 produces (S)-product.  
   - **Option D**: A = (R), B = (S). This is incorrect because it would lead to the wrong stereochemical outcomes for the products.  

### Conclusion:  
The correct starting materials are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (A) and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid (B). These enantiomers, when treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, produce the (R)- and (S)-configured products as described.

**Answer: C**
