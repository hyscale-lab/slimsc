Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so I'll need to compute both values and see which option matches.

I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in special relativity, you can't just subtract them like you would in classical mechanics. There's a specific formula for adding velocities relativistically. The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, if object A is moving at u relative to the lab frame and object B at v, then the speed of A relative to B is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Or wait, maybe I should think of it as the frame where one is at rest and find how the other moves.

Wait no, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) when u and v are in the same direction. Let me make sure. So for the relative speed between the two astronauts, since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed of the slower one (0.5c) as seen by the faster one (0.6c) would be v_rel = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is (0.5 - 0.6) c = (-0.1 c), but since speed is a magnitude, maybe I should take the absolute value? Or perhaps it's better to compute the magnitude after. Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of the relative motion: which astronaut is moving faster, so the relative speed is the difference divided by 1 minus product over c squared.

Wait, wait. I think the formula is:

If frame S' is moving at speed u relative to S, then the speed of an object moving at speed v in S is (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)) in S'.

So in this problem, let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective (S'), B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/[1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)].

So that would be (-0.1 c) / [1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²)] = (-0.1 c)/(1-0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.142857 c. The negative sign indicates direction, but since speed is positive, the magnitude is 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed, which is option C or D.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so we need to compute their energies and sum them.

The energy of a relativistic object is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

For astronaut A: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E_A = gamma_A * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E_B = gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy is E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². That's about 5.96 mc², which matches option C.

Looking at the options:

Option C says v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That's what we got.

Option D has the same relative speed but E=5 mc², which is lower than our calculation, so it's not correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic formula for relative velocity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (faster astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (slower astronaut). Substituting:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates direction, but the magnitude is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 = 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
