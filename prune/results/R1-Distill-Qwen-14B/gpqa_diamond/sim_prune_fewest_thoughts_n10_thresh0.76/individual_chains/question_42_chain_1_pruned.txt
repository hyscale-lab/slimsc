Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read it again and see what's given.

The question is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. I remember that TTV is a method used to detect planets by observing the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. So these planets have been discovered using that technique.

The problem states that the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures are given. Between Planet1 and Planet2, it's about 1.4. So Planet2's equilibrium temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet1. Between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So Planet3's temperature is 2.3 times Planet2's. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratio is between Planet2 and Planet3. So if it's approximately 2.3, does that mean Planet2's temperature is 2.3 times Planet3's? Or the other way around? Hmm. The wording says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So that would mean T2 / T1 = 1.4, so T2 is hotter. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is 2.3—so T3 / T2 = 2.3? Or is it T2 / T3? I think the wording is Planet2 to Planet3, so their ratio is 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3? Or T3 / T2 = 2.3? Wait, wait, the question says the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So if it's T2 to T3, it's 2.3. So T2 is 2.3 times T3. That would mean Planet3 is cooler than Planet2, because 2.3 is the ratio of T2 to T3.

Alternatively, maybe the way the ratio is presented is T_planet_x / T_planet_y. So for Planet1 and Planet2, it's 1.4, so Planet2's temperature is 1.4 times Planet1. For Planet2 and Planet3, 2.3, so Planet3 is 2.3 times Planet2's temperature. Wait, that can't be, because then Planet3 would be hotter than Planet2, which would be even hotter than Planet1. But the mass ratios might influence that.

Wait, no, the problem says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So that's T2 / T1 = 1.4, so T2 is hotter. Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. So T3 / T2 = 2.3. So T3 is 2.3 times hotter than T2. Wait, that would make Planet3 the hottest. Hmm.

But let's think about equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = [(L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²)]^1/4

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity and the planet's albedo. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that factor is the same for all.

So for each planet, T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4). Since all three planets orbit the same star, L is the same for each. So T is proportional to (1/D²)^(1/4) = 1/D^(1/2). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T ∝ 1/√D.

So if T2 / T1 = 1.4, then D1/D2 = (T2/T1)^2. Because since T ∝ 1/√D, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2). So T2 / T1 = sqrt(D1/D2). So (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2. So D1 = (T2/T1)^2 * D2.

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write the equations:

T1 = (L/(16 π σ D1² (1 - a)) )^0.25
Similarly for T2 and T3.

Since L and a are the same, T is proportional to (1/D²)^0.25 = 1/(D^0.5
