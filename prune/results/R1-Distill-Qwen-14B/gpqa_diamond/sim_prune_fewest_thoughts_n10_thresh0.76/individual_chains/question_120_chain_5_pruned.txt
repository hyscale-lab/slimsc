Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. Let me think.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax. So if a star has a parallax plx (in arcseconds), its distance d is approximately 1/plx parsecs.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's like, how many stars do you find when you look at a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx. And how does that number depend on plx.

I think I need to consider the volume of space at a certain distance. So, the number of stars should depend on the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. Because stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell should be proportional to the volume of that shell.

The volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So if I have a shell at radius r with thickness dr, the volume is 4π r squared times dr. Since the number density is uniform, the number of stars would be proportional to this volume.

But wait, parallax is 1/d. So if d is in parsecs, plx = 1/d. Let me make this substitution. Let's say plx = 1/d
