Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Each option gives different masses and sometimes radius or composition, so I need to figure out the density for each.

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cmÂ³. So this planet's density would be same as Earth's. So a's density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density ~5.5. Wait, wait. Wait no, the question says the planet has a density of 5.5. So if it's already given, then its density is 5.5. So same as a. But wait, maybe the composition isn't the same? No, the question says the options are different exoplanets. Wait, no, option b just states a density, perhaps without considering composition. Hmm, I'll come back to this.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition means same density, right? Because composition affects density. Earth is made of similar materials as this planet, so same density. But wait, if the mass increases, but the radius? Let me think. If mass is 5x Earth's mass, and same density, then volume is (mass)/(density) = 5M_earth / density. Earth's volume is M_earth/density. So the radius would be bigger. But the question is about density. Since composition is same, density should be same as Earth. So c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So again, same density as Earth, 5.5. So d's density is 5.5.

Wait, but option b says the planet has a density of approximately 5.5. So same as a, c, d. So why is the question asking which has the highest density if all are 5.5? That can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, maybe I misread. Let me look again.

Option a: Earth mass and radius, same as Earth. So 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, but density is 5.5. Hmm, but if a planet has a higher mass but same density, it must be larger in volume. But that doesn't change the density. So it's 5.5.

Option c: same composition as Earth, so same
