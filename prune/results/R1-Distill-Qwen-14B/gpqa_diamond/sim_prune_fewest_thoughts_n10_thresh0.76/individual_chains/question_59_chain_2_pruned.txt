Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Let me see, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that's a mix of a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. I remember that mixing acids and bases can lead to neutralization reactions, especially between strong acids and bases. 

First, I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Moles are calculated by concentration multiplied by volume in liters. Let me start with each component one by one.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid), the volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L, and the concentration is 0.1 M. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But when considering neutralization, maybe I need to see if it's in excess after reacting with the base.

Next is HCl, which is a strong acid. Volume is 400 mL or 0.4 L, concentration 0.2 M. Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L, and concentration 0.3 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each formula unit gives two OH^- ions, right? So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. Therefore, 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2 would give 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, I need to see how these react when mixed. When you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. The reaction between H+ and OH- produces water. But here, there are multiple acids and a baseâ€”so which will react first?

So, the HCl is a strong acid, so it'll donate H+ ions. The Ba(OH)2 will donate OH- ions. The OH- will react with H+ from HCl first because HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions immediately. After that, any excess OH- will react with the weak acid, CH3COOH.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

HCl provides 0.08 moles of H+.
Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 moles of OH-.

When H+ and OH- react, the neutralization is 1:1. So, how
