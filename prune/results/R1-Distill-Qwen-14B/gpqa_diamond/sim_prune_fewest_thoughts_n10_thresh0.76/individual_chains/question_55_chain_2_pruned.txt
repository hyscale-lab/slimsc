Alright, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates, with cis and trans isomers.

First, I'll remember what these structures look like. Both propenyl and butenyl groups are alkenes. Acetate esters have the structure OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. The key here is looking at the splitting patterns and the coupling constants in the NMR.

The given NMR data has four signals:

1. 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz.
2. 5.5 ppm, 1H, doublet of quadruplets (dq).
3. 2.1 ppm, 3H, singlet.
4. 1.6 ppm, 3H, doublet.

Let me break this down. The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the acetate's methyl group, since that's typically around 2.1 as a singlet. The 1.6 ppm doublet suggests a methyl group adjacent to something, probably a CH2 group next to a double bond.

Now, looking at the protons on the double bond. For both propenyl and butenyl groups, the vicinal coupling (between the two double bond protons) would be around 16 Hz. Wait, in the first signal, the coupling is J=16 Hz, so that's a trans coupling? Wait, no, wait, the coupling constant for trans alkenes is larger than cis. Wait, no, actually, I think I got that mixed up. Let me think: trans double bonds have a larger coupling because the protons are on opposite sides and can have more effective coupling. So J around 16 Hz is probably for a trans double bond.

Wait, but the first peak is a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16.0 Hz. So that's one proton, which is split into a doublet by another proton. Let's imagine the structure. If it's an acetate ester, the structure would be something like CH2CH2-OAc or similar. But wait, for propenyl or butenyl.

Let me think about the possible structures. For propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. The protons on the double bond would be at around 5.5 ppm maybe. Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a proton with J=16, which is a large coupling. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the coupling between the two double bond protons. If the molecule is trans, then the two protons are on opposite sides, leading to a larger J value. So, a trans double bond might have a J around 16 Hz. So the peak at 7.0 ppm could be one of the double bond protons, coupled to another with J=16.

But wait, what about
