Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty principle says that the variance of an observable is given by the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So for ΔP_z, I need to compute the variance, which is ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩². But wait, if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, what about P_z? Are they commuting? Probably not since they're different components. So P_z and P_x don't commute, meaning they can't be simultaneously diagonalized, so the state is not an eigenstate of P_z.

So, first, I need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

But wait, the given state is the eigenstate of P_x. So the state vector is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So that's |ψ⟩.

Wait, the matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z are given. Let me write down the matrix for P_z. It's diagonal, right? The first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second is (0,0,0), third is (0,0,-ħ). So P_z is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the state |ψ⟩ can be written as a linear combination of these basis vectors.

So |ψ⟩ is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So that's a vector in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors. So each component corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate.

But to compute expectation values, I can proceed directly.

Let me recall that ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where A is an operator.

So first, compute ⟨P_z⟩. But since the state is not an eigenstate of P_z, the expectation value is a weighted average of the eigenvalues.

Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal in the given basis, the expectation value would just be the sum of
