Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The problem is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity is smaller, radius r, with its center a distance s away from the conductor's center. So imagine a sphere, and inside it somewhere not at the center, there's a smaller cavity. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, meaning P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. So I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, the charges inside the cavity must induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh wait, right! When a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to it, and the outer surface will have no net charge because the conductor as a whole is neutral. So in this case, the +q inside will cause the inner surface to have -q, and the outer surface will have +q to balance, but wait, no, wait: the conductor is neutral. So the inner surface must have -q, and then the outer surface must have +q, because the total charge of the conductor is zero.

Wait no, wait. The conductor is initially uncharged. So the total charge on the conductor must be zero. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q (due to induction), and the outer surface must then have +q to make the total charge zero. Because the conductor's initial charge is zero, so inner surface -q, outer surface +q. So the outer surface's charge is +q.

But wait, that's when the charge is placed in the cavity. So the effect outside is as if the charge is on the outer surface.
