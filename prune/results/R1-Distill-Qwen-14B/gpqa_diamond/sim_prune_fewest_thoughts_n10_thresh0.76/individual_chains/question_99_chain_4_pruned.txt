Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR spectrum around that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But the presence of a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have O-H stretches which are usually very broad and can appear anywhere from 2500-3300 cm^-1. Oh, and the peak at 1700 would be the carbonyl (C=O) in a carboxylic acid. So that makes sense. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The question states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds? Or perhaps the double bonds are not present in the structure we're looking for. So, the compound is probably a saturated molecule, maybe with branching.

Now, the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about how splitting works. Each neighboring set of protons can cause splitting. So a doublet of triplets implies a proton has two neighboring groups, one causing a doublet and another causing a triplet. Or wait, maybe it's more about the number of neighboring protons.

Wait, let me break it down. A doublet of triplets would mean the proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons. For example, if a proton is next to two groups: one with two equivalent protons and another with three, it might split into a triplet (from the two) and then each of those splits into a doublet from the three. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about each splitting step.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of protons. Let's suppose a proton is next to a CH2 group and a CH group. Each would cause splitting. But the splitting can get complicated.

Wait, looking at the options, all of them seem to have similar structures. Let me look at the options more carefully.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the structure would be something like:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

Wait, that's a bit unclear. Let me try to draw it out mentally. The main chain is probably a four-carbon chain, but
