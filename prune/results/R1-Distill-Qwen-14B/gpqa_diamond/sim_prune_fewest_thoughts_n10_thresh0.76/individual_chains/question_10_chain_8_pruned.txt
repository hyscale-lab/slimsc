Okay, so I have this question about the density of exoplanets, and I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Hmm, let me think.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with different characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, so I need to calculate or compare the densities of each option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet would have the same density as Earth. But wait, Earth isn't a perfect sphere, but I think for this question, the radius is given so we can assume it's a sphere.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if the density is given, I don't need to calculate it. Since it's 5.5, same as Earth. So maybe this isn't the highest.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Composition matters because if it's the same, the density should be similar. But wait, mass and radius—because if the mass increases, the radius would too. Let me think about it. For objects with the same composition, mass relates to volume. Volume scales with mass to the power of 1/3 (since Volume is proportional to radius³, and mass is proportional to radius³ if density is same). So if the mass is 5 times Earth's, the radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. So the density would still be same as Earth, about 5.5. So option c's density is same as Earth.

Option d: A planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Similar logic, smaller mass means smaller radius. Let me see. The cube root of 0.5 is about 0.793. So the radius is about 0.793 Earth radii. But since mass is halved, volume would be (0.793)^3 times Earth's, which is about 0.5 Earth volume. So density is mass/volume. The mass is 0.5 Earth mass, and volume is 0.5 Earth volume. So density is (0.5)/(0.5) =1 times Earth's density, so 5.5 again. Wait, that can't be right. Because density is mass divided by volume. If both decrease proportionally
