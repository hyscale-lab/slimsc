Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question says that a proton is injected into a synchrocyclotron at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Hmm, I remember that in cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons, particles are accelerated by an electric field, and they move in a magnetic field which causes them to revolve. The key is probably relating the kinetic energy gained to the number of revolutions.

Wait, what's the difference between a cyclotron and a synchrocyclotron? Oh right, in a cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is fixed, but the particles' mass increases as they gain energy, so after some point, the frequency doesn't match the particle's orbit anymore. Synchrocyclotrons, I think, have a frequency that varies with the radius to keep the resonance condition, allowing higher energies.

But in this problem, maybe the specifics of the synchrocyclotron don't matter too much. Let's think about the general approach.

The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, so its initial speed is very low. The voltage is alternating, so the electric field accelerates the proton each time the voltage is in the right phase. Each acceleration gives the proton a small energy boost.

The formula for the kinetic energy gained in a cyclotron is something like T = e * U0 * N, where N is the number of times the voltage has gone through a cycle and accelerated the proton. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, each time the proton goes through the gap between the dees, it gains energy e * U0, but that's only when the electric field is in the right direction. So the number of times it's accelerated is equal to the number of times the voltage has cycled through its maximum and the correct phase to accelerate.

Wait, but in the problem, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The frequency ν(α) is probably a function of the radius α, which changes as the proton gains energy. But perhaps the initial frequency is such that it's matched to the proton's motion.

Alternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by finding the total energy gained and dividing by the energy per revolution to find the number of revolutions.

The proton's kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV. Let me convert that to eV to work with the voltage units. 950 MeV is 950,000,000 eV.

Each acceleration from the voltage U(t) contributes e * U0. But wait, the voltage is alternating, so only when the voltage is at its peak in the right direction does the proton gain energy. However, in a syn
