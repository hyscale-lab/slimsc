Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different number in meters.

Wait, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they're produced, they don't live forever. They decay, and the mean decay distance depends on how long they live and how fast they're moving.

So, the mean decay distance is usually given by the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity times the speed of light. The formula I think is: L = γ * β * c * τ. But wait, γ is the Lorentz factor, β is v/c, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, the proper lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is connected to the mean lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, right? Or wait, maybe it's Γ = ħ / (τ). So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me get the units straight. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of GeV·s or something like that. Hmm, perhaps I should convert everything to consistent units.

So, first step: find the
