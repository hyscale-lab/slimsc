Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let's see, it's about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But wait, in this case, it says two photons are produced. 

The setup is that the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons with the same energy. The directions of the photons are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

I think I should start by considering conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, energy and momentum must be conserved. But wait, the particles are moving in opposite directions, so their momenta might add up in some way.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma. So the electron's gamma is 4, and the positron's gamma is 2. But wait, since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, I should assign a negative sign to its momentum.

Let me think: the electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), so its momentum is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from the right), so its momentum is negative.

The momentum of each particle would be gamma * mass * velocity. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite in sign too.

Wait, but since they're annihilating, the initial total momentum must equal the total momentum of the photons after.

Hmm, the rest mass of an electron and positron is the same. Let me suppose their rest mass is m. So the electron's momentum is gamma_e * m * v_e, and the positron's is gamma_p * m * v_p, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, it's negative.

Wait, but velocity can't be more than c. So I might need to find their actual velocities, but maybe it's easier to work with momentum in terms of gamma and m.

Wait, another approach: the total momentum of the system before collision is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron.

Alternatively, since the electron is moving to the right, its momentum is +gamma_e * m_e * v_e, and the positron is to the left, so -gamma_p * m_p * v_p. But wait, positron has the same mass as electron, m_p = m_e = m.

Wait, so let me calculate each particle's momentum. For relativistic particles, momentum p = gamma * m * v. But gamma is given, so perhaps we can express v in terms of gamma.

Wait, another way: p = gamma * m * v. But since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), perhaps I can relate gamma and beta (beta = v/c). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), which implies beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). 

So for the electron, gamma_e = 4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.
