Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically regarding a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral crystals... I remember they have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

Wait, interplanar distance, that's the d-spacing. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something involving the angles?) I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think. Oh wait, I think for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. So I must be missing some terms related to the angles.

Oh right! The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c (but in rhombohedral, a = b = c) and angles alpha, beta, gamma is given by:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k² cos²(alpha))/(b²) + (l² cos²(beta))/(c²) ) minus some cross terms. Wait, no, perhaps I should recall the correct formula. Alternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system, the formula simplifies because a = b = c and the angles are all the same.

Wait, the general formula is 1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - (2hk cos(beta-gamma) )/(a b) - (2hl cos(alpha-gamma))/(a c) - (2kl cos(alpha-beta))/(b c)). Oh, but that seems complicated. Since in rhombohedral, a = b = c = a0, and all angles are equal to alpha (30 degrees here), maybe the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I think there's a simplified formula for rhombohedral systems. Let me think: for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance (d) for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) ) )

Wait, wait, no. I'm getting confused. Another approach: the interplanar distance formula in a rhombohedral system can be written using the following formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2 hk (1 - cos(alpha)))/(a²) - 2(hk cos(alpha) + hl cos(alpha) + kl cos(alpha) )/(a²).

Wait, maybe another way. Alternatively, the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The general formula for d-spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is:

1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - (2hk cos(beta) )/(a b) - (2hl cos(gamma) )/(a c) - (2kl cos(alpha) )/(b c )

But in the rhombohedral case, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. So substituting these into the formula.

So plugging in, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So,

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a0²) - [ 2hk cos(30) + 2 hl cos(30) + 2 kl cos(30) ] / (a0² )

Factor out cos(30) and 2/(a0²):

1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos(30) - 2hl cos(30) - 2kl cos(30) ] / a0²

Hmm, can I factor this numerator?

The numerator looks like [ (h - k)^2 + ... ] but wait, let me expand (h - k)^2 = h² + k² - 2hk.

But in our case, the numerator is h² +k² +l² - 2 cos(30)(hk + hl + kl ). So perhaps it's [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 cos(alpha)(hk + hl + kl) ].

So, then 1/d² = [ h² + k² + l² - 2 cos(alpha)(hk + hl + kl) ] / a0²

So the denominator is a0 squared, so d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 cos(alpha)(hk + hl + kl) )

But wait, in the case of a cubic system (alpha = 90), cos(alpha) is zero, so the formula reduces to the usual d = a / sqrt(h²+k²+l²). So that makes sense.

In our problem, the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So, let's compute the denominator inside the square root:

Denominator inside sqrt: (1^2 + 1^2 +1^2) - 2 * cos(30) * (1*1 + 1*1 +1*1 )

Let me compute that
