Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read through it carefully and think through each part.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. There's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector used here. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Wait, I think the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. Oh, IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so that the second gene can be translated even if the first is being expressed. So the ligand and receptor are co-expressed but possibly in a regulated way.

There are stop cassettes: the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP between it and mCherry. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. So normally, the stop would prevent expression unless the lox sites are excised by Cre. So when Cre is present, it would remove the stops, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusion proteins.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the proteins on Western blot. The blot uses actin as a loading control. So they probably checked expression of the ligand and receptor, but the question says that when they breed the mice and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see a green signal. So eGFP isn't being expressed in the offspring.

Wait, wait. The vector is a bicistronic vector with ligand and receptor. Let me think about how this works. The CBA promoter drives the ligand, then through the IRES, the receptor is expressed. The stops are in between each ORF and their respective fluorescent proteins. So without Cre, mCherry is expressed as a fusion with the ligand, but the receptor-eGFP is blocked by the stop. Or wait, no. Let me clarify.

The ligand ORF is first, then a stop with loxP. Then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then a stop with lox2272. So when Cre is present, which Cre variant are we talking about? Because loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites. Cre can only cut loxP sites, right? Or wait, no. There are different Cre variants, like Cre vs. Cre/Flp. Oh, I think lox2272 is a lox site that is recognized by Cre, but perhaps they are using a dual system here. Or maybe the first stop is loxP and can be cut by Cre, and the second is lox2272, which is a different site, maybe requiring a different recombinase.

Wait, the
