Okay, so I've got this question about crystal structures and interplanar distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, rhombohedral, right, that's a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, right? So in a rhombohedral structure, that would be the lattice parameter 'a' perhaps?

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ)) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos \alpha - 2hl \cos \beta - 2kl \cos \gamma}}} 

But wait, in a rhombohedral crystal
