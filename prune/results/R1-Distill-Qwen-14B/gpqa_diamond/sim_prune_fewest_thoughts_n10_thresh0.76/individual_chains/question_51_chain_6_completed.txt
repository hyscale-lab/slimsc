Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when charges are placed near conductors, some things change because of induced charges. Let me think through this.

The question says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

First, when a conducting sphere is grounded, any induced charges can move freely. The sphere's potential must be the same as the ground, which is usually considered zero. Wait, no, wait—grounded means the sphere's potential is at the ground's potential, which is (usually) zero. So the conducting sphere is at zero potential.

Now, a charge q is placed outside the sphere. Since the sphere is a conductor, the charges will redistribute. The induced charges on the sphere would create an image charge. Wait, image charges... right, in the method of images, when you have a charge near a conductor, you can model it as if there's an image charge inside the conductor such that the conductor's surface behaves as if it's an equipotential.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So the image charge method might still apply. Let me think: the image charge q' would be placed such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So the image charge should be inside the sphere, right? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. If the sphere is conducting and grounded, it's a conductor with zero potential. So the setup is that the charge q is outside the sphere, and the sphere is at zero potential. The potential due to q and the induced charges on the sphere must sum to zero on the sphere's surface.

Alternatively, I remember that for a point charge outside a grounded conducting sphere, the potential energy can be found by considering the work done in bringing the charge from infinity to its position, considering the induced charges.

Wait, but another approach: the potential energy U is the work done to assemble the system. So initially, there's no charge. We bring in charge q to a distance d from the sphere's center. The sphere, being grounded, will allow charges to flow in or out as needed to maintain zero potential on its surface.

But wait, the sphere is neutral to begin with? Or does the presence of charge q induce a charge on the sphere? Right, the conducting sphere would have induced charges. The presence of charge q induces an opposite charge on the near side of the sphere and a positive charge on the far side. But because the sphere is grounded, these induced charges can move, so the sphere as a whole could have a net charge. Wait, no, the sphere is a conductor, so the induced charges will arrange themselves on the surface.

Wait, but since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can leave the sphere. For example, if q is positive, the sphere's near side would have negative induced charges, and the far side would have positive. But because it's grounded, the positive charges can leave through the ground, leaving the sphere with a net negative charge? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. If the sphere is conducting and grounded, any excess charge can leave. Wait, no, wait. The sphere is initially neutral. When a charge q is placed nearby, it induces a charge on the sphere. But because the sphere is grounded, any induced charges must arrange such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. But I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the system using image charges. The method of images says that the potential due to a charge outside a conductor can be represented as the potential due to the actual charge plus the potential due to an image charge inside the conductor.

But wait, in this case, the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. The image charge method might still apply, but I need to find the image charge's magnitude and position.

In the image method for a sphere, the image charge q' is placed on the line connecting the charge q and the center of the sphere. The distance from the center to the image charge would be at a distance r = (R^2)/d, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the image charge position is such that the distance from the center is R^2/d. So if the actual charge q is at distance d from the center, the image charge is at a distance of R²/d from the center, on the opposite side relative to q. So if q is at d, the image charge q' is at (R²/d) but on the other side of the sphere's center.

But wait, since the sphere is grounded, the image charge should be inside the sphere. So the image charge is inside the sphere, at a distance from the center of R²/d. So if d is larger than R, the image charge is inside.

Wait, but the sphere's radius is R, so the image charge is at a distance r = R²/d from the center. So for d > R, r is less than R, which would place it inside the sphere. That makes sense.

The image charge q' would have a magnitude that depends on the situation. I think the image charge for a point charge outside a sphere is given by q' = - (q R)/(d). Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think. The potential at the surface must be zero. So the potential due to q and the image charge at the surface must sum to zero.

Wait, the sphere's surface is at radius R. The potential there should be zero because it's grounded. So the potential due to charge q is kq/(R) [if d is much larger than R, but generally, it's kq/(sqrt(d^2 + R^2 - 2dR cosθ)) for some angle θ, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the potential at the sphere's surface due to q and the image charge q' must cancel out.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the system as charge q and image charge q'. The potential at the sphere's surface due to both must be zero. The sphere's surface is a distance R from its center, and the charge q is at a distance d from the center. The image charge is at a distance of R²/d from the center, on the opposite side.

So the potential at the surface due to q is k q / (sqrt( (d - R)^2 + R^2 - 2 (d - R)(R) cos θ ) )? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the potential contributions.

Wait, perhaps the image charge q' is such that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero. So the potential from q plus the potential from q' should be zero.

But the sphere is conducting and grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential due to the external charge q and the image charge q' should add up to zero at every point on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but for a sphere, the potential due to any external charge can be treated as if it's at the center, due to the shell theorem. So the potential at the surface due to q is k q / R.

Similarly, the potential due to the image charge q' (which is inside the sphere) can be treated as if it's at the center. So the potential due to q' is k q' / R.

But for the surface potential to be zero, these two potentials must cancel each other. So k q / R + k q' / R = 0 → q + q' = 0 → q' = -q.

Wait, that would imply that the image charge is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to q. But that can't be right because the distance of the image charge would be R^2/d, so the image charge's magnitude is q' = - (q R^2) / d²? Not sure. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge q' is inside the sphere, and the potential due to q and q' at the surface must be zero.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the method of images: the image charge is placed inside the sphere such that the potential due to q and q' on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, for a sphere, the image charge is located along the line connecting the charge and the center. The image charge's magnitude is q' = - (q R) / d, and it's located at a distance r from the center equal to R²/d.

So the image charge is q' = - (q R)/d, placed at a distance R²/d from the center, on the opposite side of q.

Now, the potential energy of the system would be the potential energy of the charge q in the field of the image charge, plus the potential energy due to the image charge itself, but since the image charge is part of the system, I think only half of it is considered because the image charge is a construct and not a real charge.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. The potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. Since the sphere is grounded, any work done in bringing charges onto the sphere would be accounted for, but the sphere's potential remains zero.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system can be found by considering the energy stored in the electric fields created by the charges. But perhaps a simpler approach is to compute the potential energy due to the charge and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy U is the sum of the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere. But the sphere is grounded, so the potential at its surface is zero, which might affect how we calculate this.

Alternatively, the potential energy can be considered as the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system as q and the image charge q'. The potential energy U would be the potential energy between q and q'. Because the sphere's potential is zero, the work done in bringing q to its position is half the product of the charges times the potential per unit charge or something like that.

Wait, the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. So in this case, U would be k * q * q' / (d + (R²/d)) ) since the distance between q (at d) and the image charge (at R²/d on the opposite side) would be d - R²/d. Wait, no, wait: the image charge is on the opposite side, so the distance between q and q' is d + (R²/d), because the image is inside the sphere.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the positions. If the charge q is at a point P, which is a distance d from the center of the sphere O. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, at a distance of (R²/d) from O, along the line OP. So the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d). Because P is at d from O, and q' is at (R²/d) from O in the opposite direction. So the separation between q and q' is d + (R²/d) ?

Wait, no, no. Let me imagine: O is the center. q is at point P, distance d from O. q' is on the line OP, but inside the sphere, so on the opposite side of O from P. So the distance from O to q' is (R²/d), right?

So the distance between q and q' is d + (R²/d). Because from q to O is d, then from O to q' is (R²/d) in the opposite direction, so total distance is d + (R²/d).

Wait, that makes sense. So the separation is d + (R²/d) = (d² + R²)/d.

Wait, but q and q' are opposite in sign. So the potential energy between them is U = k (q)(-q') / ( (d^2 + R^2)/(d) ) )

Wait, but earlier I thought q' is - (q R)/d. Let me clarify. In the method of images, for a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge is q' = - (q R²)/d², placed at a distance R²/d from the center. So q' = - q (R²) / d².

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again. The image charge for a point charge q outside a sphere of radius R is given by q' = - q (R²)/(d²), placed at a distance R²/d from the center, on the opposite side of the sphere from q. So that's correct.

So q' = - q (R² / d²)

So now, the potential energy U between q and q' is:

U = (k) * ( q * q' ) / (distance between them )

distance = d + (R^2/d) = (d² + R²)/d

So substituting q' and distance:

U = k * q * ( - q R² / d² ) / ( (d² + R²)/d )

Simplify:

U = k * ( - q^2 R^2 ) / d^2 * (d) / (d² + R² )

= k * ( - q^2 R^2 ) * d / (d² (d² + R^2) )

Wait, wait, that's not correct. Let me compute it step by step.

Denominator: (d² + R²)/d → so 1/(denominator) is d/(d² + R²)

So:

U = k * [ q * ( - q R² / d² ) ] * [ d / (d² + R²) ) ]

= k * ( - q^2 R² ) / d² * (d) / (d² + R² )

= k * ( - q^2 R² d ) / (d² (d² + R^2) )

Simplify denominator: d² (d² + R^2) = d² (d² + R²) )

Wait, but I can factor this as:

= k * (- q^2 R² d ) / [ d² (d² + R^2) ) ]

= k * (- q^2 R²) / [ d (d² + R^2) ) ]

Which can be written as:

U = - (k q^2 R² ) / [ d (d² + R^2) ) ]

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them look like this. Let me check the options again.

Option A: U= - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2 )

Option C: U= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Hmm, none of these match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge approach.

Wait, another thought: since the sphere is grounded, the image charge method might not directly give the potential energy. Maybe I should think about the work done in bringing the charge q to its position, considering the induced charges on the sphere.

Alternatively, the potential energy of the system is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere being grounded means its potential is zero, so the work done in bringing the induced charges is accounted for.

Wait, but how much charge is induced on the sphere? Let me think: when a charge q is placed outside the sphere, it induces a charge -q on the near side and +q on the far side. But wait, because the sphere is grounded, the charges can flow away. So the total induced charge on the sphere would be zero? No, that's not right because the sphere is a conductor, so the induced charges are on the surface and the conductor's net charge is the same as the sum of these induced charges.

Wait, no, the sphere is neutral initially. When you place charge q near it, the induced charges would redistribute. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge can leave, so the sphere's net charge remains zero. Wait, that's possible. So the induced charges are +q and -q, but because the sphere is grounded, the positive charge can leave, leaving the sphere with a net negative charge of -q? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's net charge after induction is zero because any excess can leave. So, the sphere remains neutral, so the induced charges are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, but the total is zero. So the charges induced are -q on the near side and +q on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the +q can leave, leaving the sphere with -q. So the net induced charge on the sphere would be -q.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try a different approach. The potential energy of the system can be calculated as the sum of the potential energies of each charge in the potential due to the others.

But in this case, we have the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. However, since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges are at the surface, and the potential on the sphere is zero. So the potential energy would be the work done in bringing q to its position, against the potential due to the induced charges.

Wait, but the induced charges are on the sphere, which is at zero potential. So the potential at infinity is zero, and the sphere is at zero potential, so bringing q from infinity to a point where the sphere's potential is zero would imply no work is done. But that's not correct because the presence of the sphere's induced charges would affect the potential.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges. The induced charges are -q on the near side and +q on the far side. But because the sphere is grounded, the +q leaves, so the sphere's net charge is -q. So, q is placed, and the sphere has -q. So the system consists of two charges: q and -q, separated by a certain distance.

Wait, but the separation distance between q and the center of the sphere is d. The sphere's radius is R, so the separation between q and the center of the sphere is d. The charge -q is on the sphere's surface, so the distance between q and the sphere's charge is approximately d - R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is simply the potential energy between the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere. But the sphere's induced charge is -q, so the potential energy would be U = k q (-q) / (d - R) ), but that would be k (-q²)/(d - R). But that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the work done to bring the charge q to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charges.

But the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the sphere's induced charges. Hmm, but the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential at any point outside the sphere is only due to the external charges, but the sphere itself is at zero potential.

Wait, another approach: the potential at the location of charge q is due to the induced charges on the sphere. The sphere being a conductor, the potential is the same everywhere on its surface, which is zero. So the potential at the location of q would be the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere.

But how much is that potential? The sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential at infinity is also zero, but the sphere's potential is zero due to induction.

Wait, perhaps the potential at the point where q is placed is the same as the potential at that point due to the induced charges on the sphere. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the potential energy can be considered as the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the work done in bringing the induced charges to the sphere is considered, but the sphere's potential remains zero.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the problem differently. The potential energy U is the electrostatic potential energy of the system, which includes the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

But another way to think about this is to consider the system as a point charge and a conducting sphere. The potential energy is given by the work done to bring the charge q into the presence of the sphere, which has induced charges, but since the sphere is grounded, it's at zero potential.

Wait, but when you bring a charge near a conducting sphere at zero potential, the potential energy is the same as if the sphere were a point charge located at its center. So the potential at the point where q is placed is k Q / d, where Q is the charge induced on the sphere.

Wait, but earlier I thought the sphere's net charge after induction is -q. But if the sphere is grounded, perhaps the induced charge is such that the sphere's potential is zero. So the induced charge would be such that the potential due to the induced charges plus the potential due to q equals zero on the sphere's surface.

Wait, maybe the potential due to q at the sphere's surface is V = k q / sqrt( d^2 + R^2 - 2 d R cosθ ) ), but that's complicated because it varies with θ. But due to the conductor, the potential is uniform, so the potential due to q at the sphere's surface must be canceled by the potential due to the induced charges.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to model the sphere as a point charge at its center. The potential due to q and the sphere's induced charge must sum to zero on the sphere's surface.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential due to q at the surface is k q / R, and the potential due to the sphere's induced charge Q is k Q / R. So these must add to zero: k q / R + k Q / R = 0 → q + Q = 0 → Q = -q.

Wait, that suggests that the sphere's induced charge is -q. But if the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charge must be such that the sphere's potential is zero. So the sphere has a charge Q = -q.

So the system is a charge q and a charge -q. The potential energy between them is U = k q (-q) / (d - R), assuming that the separation is d - R. But that doesn't seem right because the image method suggests a different distance.

Wait, no, because the induced charge -q is on the surface of the sphere, which has radius R. So the distance between q and the induced charge is approximately d - R, but that's only if the induced charge is on the near side. Alternatively, the separation is more accurately d + R, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that when a charge q is placed at distance d from the center of a sphere with induced charge Q, the potential at the surface is zero. So the sum of potentials due to q and Q is zero at the surface.

So, V_sphere = V_q + V_Q = 0.

V_q at the sphere's surface is k q / (sqrt(d^2 + R^2 - 2 d R cosθ )) ), but that's complicated because it's a function of θ. Alternatively, using the shell theorem, the potential at the sphere's surface due to q is k q / R.

Wait, no, the shell theorem says that a shell of charge contributes as if all its charge were at the center. So the potential at the surface due to q is k q / R. But that's only if the sphere is uncharged. Wait, but the sphere has an induced charge Q. So the potential at the surface due to Q is k Q / R.

So, V_sphere = (k q / R) + (k Q / R) )= 0 → Q = -q.

So the induced charge on the sphere is -q, which makes sense.

Now, the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charge -q on the sphere.

But wait, the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero. So the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the induced charge -q.

The potential at a point a distance d from the center of the sphere is the same as the potential at that point due to the induced charge -q. But the induced charge is distributed on the sphere's surface. But for a conducting sphere, the potential outside is as if the charge were at the center. So the potential due to -q is k (-q) / d.

So the potential at the location of q due to the sphere is V = k (-q) / d.

The potential energy U is then the charge q multiplied by this potential: U = q * V = q * ( -k q / d ) = - k q² / d.

But none of the options match this. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: U= - (1/2) k q² d/(d^2 + R^2 )

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something here. The induced charge is -q, but the sphere's radius is R, so the actual potential at q's location due to the sphere's induced charge is not exactly k (-q) / d. Because the sphere's induced charge is -q, but its field outside is as if it's a point charge at the center.

Wait, so the potential at point P (distance d from center) due to the sphere's charge -q is V = k (-q) / d.

So the potential energy is U = q * V = q * ( -k q / d ) = -k q² / d.

But looking at the options, this doesn't match any. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, but let's think again. The potential energy U is the work done in assembling the system. So the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charge.

As the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. So when bringing q from infinity to distance d, the potential at that point due to the sphere's induced charge is V = k (-q) / d.

So the work done is U = q * V = q * ( -k q / d ) = - k q² / d.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy also includes the work done in assembling the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges are at zero potential, so no work is done in bringing them there.

Wait, but the induced charges are on the sphere, which is at zero potential. So the potential energy of the system is just the potential energy between q and the sphere's induced charge -q.

Which is U = k q (-q) / (d - R) )? Or is it d + R? I'm getting confused about the exact separation.

Wait, no. The sphere has radius R, so the induced charge -q is distributed on the surface. The distance between q (at d) and the center is d, so the distance from q to any point on the sphere's surface is at least d - R and at most d + R.

But for potential calculations, the potential due to the sphere (as a conductor) at a point outside is as if all the charge were at the center. So the potential at q's location due to the sphere's induced charge is V = k (-q) / d.

So U = q * V = -k q² / d.

But this doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential energy is not just due to the charge q and the sphere's induced charge, but also the work done in assembling the induced charges themselves. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges are at zero potential, so their potential energy is zero. So the only contribution is the potential energy of q in the field of the sphere's induced charge.

So U = - k q² / d.

But looking at the options again, none match this. So perhaps I'm missing something about the image charge approach.

Wait, going back to the image charge method: the image charge is q' = - q R² / d², located at a distance R²/d from the center, on the opposite side of q.

The distance between q and q' is d + R²/d = (d² + R²)/d.

The potential energy between them is U = k q q' / ( (d² + R²)/d )

= k q ( - q R² / d² ) * (d/(d² + R²) )

= - k q² R² / (d (d² + R²) )

Simplify: U = - k q² R² / (d (d² + R²) )

Hmm, looking at the options again, none match this.

Wait, let's look at option A: - (1/2) (k q² d)/(d² + R^2 )

Our result is - k q² R²/(d (d² + R²) )

But none match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge approach. Maybe the image charge approach gives half of this potential energy because the image charge is considered as a construct, not a real charge. So the potential energy would be half of what I calculated.

So U = (1/2) * [ -k q² R² / (d (d² + R²) ) ]

= - (k q² R² ) / [ 2 d (d² + R²) ) ]

But this still doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the image charge approach isn't applicable here because the sphere is grounded. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of self-energy and interaction energy.

Alternatively, the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the potential at its surface is zero, so the induced charge is -q.

So the potential energy is U = (1/2) k q (-q) / (d - R )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the potential energy between a charge and a conducting sphere can be found using the image charge method, but taking into account that the sphere is grounded, which would affect the image charge's position or magnitude.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of the system is the same as the potential energy between the charge q and the image charge q'. But since the image charge isn't a real charge, the actual potential energy is half of that.

So initially, I calculated U = - k q² R²/(d (d^2 + R^2) )

If the real potential energy is half of that, then U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d (d^2 + R^2) )

Which simplifies to U = - (k q² R²) / (2 d (d² + R²) )

But none of the options match this either.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider another approach. The potential energy can be found as the sum of the potential energies of the individual charges.

Wait, another way: the potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the induced charge on the sphere.

Since the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface is zero. The potential at the point where q is placed is the potential due to the induced charge on the sphere.

The induced charge on the sphere is -q, and the potential at distance d due to this charge (using the shell theorem) is V = k (-q) / d.

So the potential energy is U = q * V = q ( -k q / d ) = - k q² / d.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options provided, which makes me think I'm missing a critical factor.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²)

Wait, that would be the case if the distance was d - R, but in our case, the denominator is d² + R².

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy stored in the electric fields. The potential energy is the energy stored in the electric field created by the charges.

The electric field due to charge q is E = k q / r². The energy stored in this field can be found by integrating over all space, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is given by the formula U = (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at the point where q is placed due to the induced charges.

In this case, V is the potential due to the induced charge -q on the sphere at the location of q, which is V = k (-q) / d.

So U = (1/2) q * ( -k q / d ) → U = - (1/2) k q² / d.

But again, none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the induced charge as -q. Earlier, using the image charge method, the induced charge was found to be -q. But maybe that's not correct.

Wait, let me clarify: When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges are such that the near side is -q and the far side is +q. But since the sphere is grounded, the +q can leave, so the net induced charge is -q. So the sphere has a net charge of -q.

So the potential energy is between the charge q and the sphere's induced charge -q. The separation between them would be d - R, assuming the charge is on the surface. But that's an approximation.

But considering the exact positions, the distance between q and the center is d, and the induced charge -q is on the sphere's surface. So the distance between q and the sphere's surface is d - R (if it's on the near side) or d + R (if it's on the far side). But the potential due to the sphere's charge is as if it's at the center, so the distance used is d.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the potential energy using the image charge method, but with the sphere being grounded. In that case, the image charge is q' = - q R²/d², located at a distance R²/d from the center, on the opposite side of q.

The potential energy between q and q' is U = k q q' / (distance between them )

Distance between q and q' is d + R²/d = (d² + R²)/d.

So U = k q (- q R²/d² ) / ( (d² + R²)/d )

= -k q² R² / (d² (d² + R²)/d )

Simplify denominator: d² (d² + R²) / d = d (d² + R²)

So U = -k q² R² / (d (d² + R²) )

But considering that the image charge is a construct, the real potential energy is half of this.

So U = (1/2) * [ -k q² R² / (d (d² + R²) ) ]

= - (k q² R² ) / ( 2 d (d² + R²) )

Looking at the options, none match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge approach. Let me think again. The image charge method gives the potential energy as U = (k q q') / r, but perhaps I should account for the fact that the sphere is grounded, which affects the image charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy of the system is given by U = (k q Q ) / (d - R), where Q is the induced charge on the sphere.

But earlier, we determined that Q = -q, so U = k q (-q) / (d - R) = -k q² / (d - R).

But this doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere as seen by the charge q. The induced charges are -q on the near side and +q on the far side, but the sphere is grounded, so the +q leaves, leaving the sphere with a net charge of -q.

So the potential at the location of q is due to this induced charge -q, which is located at a distance of d - R (since the sphere's radius is R, the charge is at distance d - R from q).

But wait, the induced charge is distributed over the sphere, so the potential at q's location is V = k (-q) / (d - R).

Thus, the potential energy is U = q * V = q * ( -k q / (d - R) ) = -k q² / (d - R).

But the options don't have this either.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the potential energy when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, which is given by U = (1/2) k q^2 ( (R) / (d^2 - R^2) ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the potential energy when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere can be expressed in terms of the image charge, and it's half of the product of the charges over the separation.

So if image charge is q' = - q R^2 / d^2, and separation is (d^2 + R^2)/d, then the potential energy is U = (1/2) k q q' / r.

= (1/2) * k * q * ( - q R^2 / d^2 ) / ( (d^2 + R^2)/d )

= (1/2) * ( -k q^2 R^2 ) / ( d^2 ) * (d) / (d^2 + R^2 )

= (1/2) * ( -k q^2 R^2 d ) / (d^2 (d^2 + R^2) )

= - (k q^2 R^2 d ) / (2 d^2 (d^2 + R^2) ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= - (k q^2 R^2 ) / (2 d (d^2 + R^2) )

Hmm, again, looking at the options, none of them match this.

Wait, let's look back at the options:

Option C) U= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Wait, the denominator is (d^2 - R^2), which is different from our result (d^2 + R^2).

Hmm, perhaps the image charge approach isn't applicable here, and another method is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the same as the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. If the sphere's induced charge is -q, then the potential at q's location is V = k (-q) / (d - R).

So U = q * V = q * ( -k q ) / (d - R ) = - k q² / (d - R )

But that's not among the options either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the induced charge. Let me think again. When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges are -q on the near side and +q on the far side. But because the sphere is grounded, the +q can flow to ground, leaving the sphere with a net charge of -q.

So the sphere has a net charge of -q, located on its surface.

The potential energy of the system is the potential energy between the charge q and the sphere's induced charge -q.

The separation between them is d - R (since the sphere's radius is R), so the potential energy is U = k q (-q) / (d - R ) = -k q² / (d - R )

But again, this doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the potential energy of a charge near a conducting sphere. I think the formula is U = - (k q^2 R) / (2 (d^2 - R^2) )

Wait, that would match option D, which is U= - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is U = (1/2) k q^2 ( R/(d^2 - R^2) )

Wait, but my earlier attempts using the image charge approach didn't lead me to any of the given options. So perhaps I should look for a formula or derivation I've seen before.

Wait, another thought: the potential energy of the system can be found using the capacitance approach. The sphere has a capacitance C = 4π ε₀ R.

When charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. So the potential energy U is the work done in bringing the charge q to its position, considering the potential due to the sphere's induced charges.

Wait, but the sphere's potential is zero, so the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the sphere's induced charges. But how?

Alternatively, the potential energy can be found using the formula U = (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at the location of q due to the sphere's induced charges.

The sphere's induced charge is -q, and the potential at the location of q (distance d from center) is V = k (-q) / (d - R )

So U = (1/2) * q * ( -k q ) / (d - R )

= - (1/2) k q² / (d - R )

Again, no match with the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the assumption about the induced charge. Let me think again. The sphere's induced charges are such that the potential on its surface is zero. So the potential due to q and the induced charges must sum to zero on the sphere's surface.

The potential at the sphere's surface due to q is k q / R.

The potential at the sphere's surface due to its induced charge Q is k Q / R.

So k q / R + k Q / R = 0 → Q = - q.

So the induced charge is indeed -q.

Now, the potential energy is the work done in bringing q from infinity to its position, which is the integral of the electric field due to the sphere's induced charge.

The electric field due to the sphere's induced charge -q is E = k (-q) r̂ / d², where r is the distance from the center.

The work done in moving q from infinity to a distance d is the integral of E · dq from infinity to d.

But E is directed radially outward (since the charge is -q), so the work done is:

W = ∫ (from ∞ to d) E dr * q

Wait, no, the work done is the integral of the electric field times the charge moved. So W = q ∫ E dr from ∞ to d.

E = k (-q) / r².

So W = q ∫ (from ∞ to d) [ -k q / r² ] dr

= - k q² ∫ (from ∞ to d) (1/r²) dr

= - k q² [ -1/r ] from ∞ to d

= - k q² [ (-1/d) - (0) ) ]

= - k q² ( -1/d )

= k q² / d.

But this would be the potential energy, U = q V, where V is the potential at d due to -q.

But according to this, U = k q² / d. But the options have a negative value, so perhaps I'm missing a negative sign.

Wait, because the induced charge is -q, the electric field points towards the sphere (since the induced charge is negative). So when moving q (which is positive) against the electric field, work is done. Or maybe I should consider the sign.

Wait, the potential due to the induced charge is V = k (-q) / d.

So the potential energy is U = q * V = q ( -k q / d ) = - k q² / d.

But again, this doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: U= - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2 )

But how does that fit?

Another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of the charge q and the induced charges. But the sphere's induced charges are at zero potential, so the potential energy is just the work done in bringing q to its position, which depends on the potential due to the induced charge.

Wait, perhaps the potential due to the induced charge is V = k Q / (d + R ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is U = (1/2) (k q^2 R )/(d^2 - R^2 )

Wait, that would match option C if the denominator were (d² - R²).

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, option A is the only one with d in the numerator. Option C has R² in the numerator and (d² - R²) in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the system as a charge and its image charge, but considering that the sphere's radius affects the potential energy.

In that case, the potential energy would be U = - (1/2) k q² R² / (d² (d² + R²) )

But I'm not seeing a match.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: U=-(1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2 )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another way: the potential energy between a charge and a conducting sphere can be found using the formula U = (1/2) k q^2 ( R / (d^2 - R^2) )

Which would match option C if the denominator is (d² - R^2).

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the image charge approach.

From the image charge approach, the potential energy was calculated as U = - k q² R²/(d (d² + R^2) )

But none of the options match this. The closest option would be option A if R² is replaced by d², which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps in the image charge approach, the potential energy is (1/2) times the product of the charges divided by the separation. So:

U = (1/2) * (k q (-q R²/d²) ) / ( (d² + R^2)/d )

= (1/2) * ( -k q² R² / d² ) * (d / (d² + R^2) )

= - (k q² R²) / ( 2 d (d² + R^2) )

But again, none of the options match this.

Given that none of the options seem to match, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge's magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is q' = - q R/d, placed at a distance R from the center, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the potential energy as the energy stored in the electric field between the charge and the sphere, which is given by U = (1/2) ε₀ E² * volume, but that's complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the potential energy of a charge near a conducting sphere:

U = - (1/2) k q^2 ( R ) / (d^2 - R^2 )

Which would match option C if the denominator is (d^2 - R^2), but option C is U= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Hmm, no, option C has R squared in the numerator.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is U = - (1/2) k q^2 ( R ) / (d^2 - R^2 )

Which would make the answer similar to option C but with R instead of R².

But none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

After all this, I think the correct answer is option A: U= - (1/2) k q² d/(d^2 + R^2 )

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not certain.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we analyze the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \). The sphere is initially neutral but develops induced charges when \( q \) is placed at a distance \( d \) from its center. Since the sphere is grounded, its surface remains at zero potential, and any induced charges redistribute to maintain this condition.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges on the Sphere**:  
   When \( q \) is placed near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere's surface. The near side of the sphere develops a charge \(-q\), and the far side develops a charge \(+q\). However, because the sphere is grounded, the \(+q\) charge flows to the ground, leaving the sphere with a net induced charge of \(-q\).

2. **Potential Energy of the System**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is determined by the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the induced charge \(-q\) on the sphere. The potential energy is given by the work done in assembling these charges, considering their separation.

3. **Image Charge Method**:  
   Using the method of images, the induced charge on the sphere can be modeled as an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere. The image charge is located at a distance \( \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere, on the opposite side of \( q \). The magnitude of the image charge is \( q' = -\frac{q R^2}{d^2} \).

4. **Distance Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The separation between \( q \) (at distance \( d \) from the center) and the image charge \( q' \) is \( \frac{d^2 + R^2}{d} \).

5. **Potential Energy Calculation**:  
   The potential energy between \( q \) and \( q' \) is:  
   \[
   U = \frac{k q q'}{\text{separation}} = \frac{k q \left(-\frac{q R^2}{d^2}\right)}{\frac{d^2 + R^2}{d}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   U = -\frac{k q^2 R^2}{d (d^2 + R^2)}
   \]
   Since the image charge is a construct, the actual potential energy of the system is half of this value:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d (d^2 + R^2)}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   None of the provided options directly match the derived expression. However, the closest match is **Option A**, which has the form:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 d}{d^2 + R^2}
   \]
   This suggests that the correct answer aligns with the structure of Option A.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the net potential energy of the system is best represented by **Option A**.
