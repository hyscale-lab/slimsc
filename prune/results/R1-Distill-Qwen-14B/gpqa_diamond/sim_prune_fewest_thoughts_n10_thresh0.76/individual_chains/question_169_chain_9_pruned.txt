Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear decay and particle physics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that in the original decay, two particles of flavor A turn into two B particles, and emit two E and two V particles. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. They mention that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint value Q.

Now, the variant changes things. Instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E particles changes in this new scenario.

I remember that in beta decay, when a nucleus emits a beta particle (like an electron), the energy spectrum is continuous. The maximum energy (endpoint) depends on the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei, minus any mass of the emitted particles. Wait, but wait—what's the detail here?

So in the original case, they have two E and two V. Let's think about what kind of particles these could be. If E and V are like electrons and neutrinos, which are light, maybe. But in the original reaction, E particles have a continuous spectrum. That makes sense because in beta decay, the emitted electron can have a range of energies up to a maximum Q value.

In beta decay, the decay equation is like n → p + e− + āntineutrino. The electron's energy is continuous because the neutrino carries away some energy. Similarly, in the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V, the E and V would share the energy released. But if V is a neutrino-like particle (massless, perhaps), then the E particles would have a continuous spectrum.

Now, in the variant, they emit one M instead of two V particles. M is exotic and massless. So now, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. How does this affect the E particles?

Wait, the original decay had four particles emitted: 2E and 2V. The variant changes that to 2E and 1M plus 2B. So, in the original, each E and V would share energy, but in the variant, perhaps the energy distribution changes.

Wait,
