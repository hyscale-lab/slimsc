Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its dissociation increases because it's less concentrated. So first, I think I need to find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution before titration.

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. The moles of acetic acid would be the initial concentration multiplied by the volume in liters. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, right?

Moles of acetic acid, CH3COOH, would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume, 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? So when we dilute it, it dissociates more. But for the initial calculation of concentration, I think it's just a matter of moles divided by total volume, regardless of dissociation. So yes, 0.025 M is correct for the diluted solution.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 as well.

The volume of NaOH needed at equivalence point is moles / concentration. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Hmm, but wait the question asks for 25% titration and equivalence point. So first, at 25% titration, we have 25% of the required volume of NaOH added. Let me think: 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but wait. So the first part is the pH at 25% titration. Then, the second part is the pH at equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part.

Starting with the 25%
