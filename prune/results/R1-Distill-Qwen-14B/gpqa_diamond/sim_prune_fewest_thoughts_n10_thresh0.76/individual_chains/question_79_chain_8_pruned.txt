Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The resulting product's NMR spectra are given. I'm supposed to figure out what Compound X is from the options provided.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane used for? Oh right, that's a strong base, like a base used in elimination reactions. It's often used for deprotonating things, maybe in epoxide openings or other eliminations. So if the product's NMR is given, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide?

Wait, wait. Oh, wait. Compound X is the starting material. So, if the reagent is a strong base, maybe the reaction is an elimination, forming an epoxide from something else? Or wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So, the reaction is probably an epoxidation or some kind of ring-opening of an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis or something else. Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, so maybe it's used to deprotonate a compound, leading to an elimination. Oh, like in the formation of epoxides from diols, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the product has a 13C NMR with a signal at 197.7 ppm. That's a high shift. What carbons are around there? Carbonyls? Or maybe an oxygenated carbon like an epoxide? Wait, the epoxide carbons typically show up around 50-70 ppm. But wait, wait. Wait, an epoxide ring opening would maybe form something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, and the starting material is a diene or something that could form an epoxide when reacted with a peracid, but that's not the case here because the reagent is a base, not a peracid.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an alcohol or something else that can form an epoxide upon treatment with a base. Or perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and the reaction is a ring-opening. Hmm.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR shows some downfield shifts. Let's look at the 1H NMR given:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, that's six signals. The two singlets for 3H each probably indicate two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signal, maybe a carbonyl or an aromatic ring but in a symmetric position.

The aromatic region has a 1H doublet at 6.75, which suggests coupling with one proton. Then, 7.08 is a doublet with 2H, which could be part of a para-substituted ring or perhaps a meta coupling. The 7.68 is another doublet with 1H, and 7.71 is a doublet with 2H. Hmm. So maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring with some substituents.

Wait, let's try to sketch this. The aromatic signals. Suppose we have a benzene ring with substituents. The doublets could indicate coupling between adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a styrene group. Styryl groups have protons that show up around 6.5 to 8 ppm, usually as doublets when part of a trans configuration.

Wait, the product's NMR has 13C NMR. Let me look at that. The 13C NMR has a signal at 197.7, which is quite high. That's probably a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester or maybe an epoxide. Wait, but epoxide carbons are usually around 50-60, so I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what does the reaction imply? The reaction is between compound X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used in elimination reactions. It can deprotonate acidic hydro
