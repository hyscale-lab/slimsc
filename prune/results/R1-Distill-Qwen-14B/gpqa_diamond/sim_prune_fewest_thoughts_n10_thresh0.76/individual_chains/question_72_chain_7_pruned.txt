Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, starting with the first part: the reaction of 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I think this is some kind of coupling reaction. Sodium iodide is often involved in elimination or substitution reactions. Wait, but with dibromomethyl groups, maybe it's a substitution where the leaving groups (like Br) are replaced.

The starting material, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, is a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group, which is a bulky, electron-donating group.

The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two substituents at positions 5 and 6 each being a dibromomethyl group. That structure probably has two CH2Br2 groups attached to the cyclohexene.

When sodium iodide is present, it might promote an elimination or perhaps a coupling. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or a substitution. But I'm thinking it's more about a cycloaddition. Wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? But Diels-Alder usually involves dienes and dienophiles. Alternatively, perhaps it's a [2+2] cycloaddition? Or maybe a coupling via elimination.

Wait, the norbornene has two double bonds. One of them might be reacting. Alternatively, the diene in the other molecule could be reacting as a dienophile. Let me think. The norbornene has an exo double bond and an endo one. The other molecule is a diene, so perhaps the norbornene acts as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction?

Wait, the norbornene
