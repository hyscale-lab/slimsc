Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like after a series of reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each part carefully.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to visualize that structure. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2) group attached via the double bond. Wait, more accurately, it's CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(=CH2)-something. So, it's a substituent where the structure is CH2 attached to a cyclohexane, with a double bond between C1 and C2 of the propene, so the substituent is CH2-C(CH2-), but that might not be the right way to think about it. Maybe it's more like a vinyl group, but with a methyl branch. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So, it's CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's like (CH2)2C=CH- but no, that's not prop-1-en-2-yl. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The en-2-yl group would be the part starting from the second carbon. So, the 2-yl group is the CH2CH2 part, but attached at the second carbon. So, prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no. The structure for prop-1-en-2-yl is actually CH2=C(CH3)-. So, the group is CH2-C(CH3)=, but that doesnâ€™t
