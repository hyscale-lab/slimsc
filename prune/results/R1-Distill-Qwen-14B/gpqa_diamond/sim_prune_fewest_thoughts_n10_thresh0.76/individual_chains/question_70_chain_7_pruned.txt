Okay, I'm going to try to solve this chemistry problem step by step. Let's see, the question is about a series of reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, let's break down the reactions given.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I wonder what A and B could be. Bright red product makes me think of something like copper(II) oxide, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that C could be a compound with a red color. Like maybe a sulfide or some transition metal compound.

Next, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is dangerous, so it must be something like a toxic gas or a strong acid perhaps. Or maybe something like chlorine gas? Or perhaps a strong oxidizing agent.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A and produce two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Strong acids include H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc. Weak ones are like CH3COOH or H3PO4. So when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and two acids—maybe one strong and one weak.

Another clue: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Solvents could be water, ethanol, maybe something like DMSO or acetone. Wait, D and B in 1:1 ratio... For example, if B is H2S and D is O2, but that's 2:1. Maybe B is SO2 and D is O2? No, that wouldn't be 1:1. Alternatively, maybe B is NH3 and D is HCl? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reactions again. So, A + 8 B → C. Then C + 2 D → E. Then C + H2O → A + F + G, where F is strong and G is weak acid.

Let me think about possible candidates. Let's consider A as a metal. Solid A reacting with gas B to form C. If B is a halogen, like Cl2, then perhaps A is something that reacts with Cl2 in a way to form a compound that's bright red.

Wait, another angle: the product C, when reacted with water, gives back A and two acids. So C is probably a salt that, upon hydrolysis, gives a strong acid and a weak acid. If F is strong and G is weak, perhaps C is a metal sulfate or something that hydrolyzes into a strong acid (like H2SO4) and a weak acid, maybe from a different anion.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, but then hydrolysis would form H2S and something else. But H2S is a weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if A is sodium (Na), B is nitrogen (N2) gas. Then 8 equivalents of N2 reacting with Na would form Na3N? Or maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps A is iron, B is sulfur, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the reaction where a metal reacts with a diatomic gas to form a compound.

Wait, maybe A is copper. Let's see: copper reacting with a gas. If B is sulfur vapor, perhaps forming CuS? But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe, B is S, making FeS? But that's a black solid, not red.

Oh wait, another possibility: A is sulfur, and B is something else. But A is a solid reacting with gas B.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal sulfide. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the products.

When C reacts with D, which is a gas, in 2 equivalents to make E, which is dangerous. So E could be something like SO3, which is a gas but not sure if extremely hazardous. Or perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but that's more from reacting with CN-.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the symmetry options. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v. These are symmetry groups. They are for molecules with certain symmetries.

What are these symmetry groups associated with?

C2 is a two-fold rotation axis. D4h is a dihedral group with 4-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. D∞h has an infinite-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (like in CO2 but for linear molecules). C2v has a two-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

What kind of molecules have these symmetries? For example, O2 has a D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is also D∞h. SO2 has D∞h? Wait, no, SO2 is a bent molecule, so maybe C2v. H2O is C2v. O3 has C2v symmetry. Let me recall:

- O2: D∞h
- Cl2: D∞h
- H2O: C2v
- SO2: D4h? Or C2v? Wait, SO2 is a bent molecule with a C2 axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to the C2 axis. So its symmetry is D2h, but I'm not certain. Maybe C2v.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The symmetry of a molecule depends on its geometry. For example:

- Linear molecules: have a D∞h symmetry if they have a center of symmetry and other elements. For example, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

- Nonlinear but polar, like H2O: has a C2v symmetry. Because it has a two-fold rotation axis (C2) and two vertical mirror planes containing the axis.
