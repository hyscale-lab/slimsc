Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a carboxylic acid group, as I can see the COOH at the end. Let's jot down the key points from the question.

First, the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since all the options have a COOH group, which has an -OH, that makes sense. The broad peak could be from the carboxylic acid's O-H stretch.

Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a region where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, amides, or carboxylic acids) absorb. Since the compound has a COOH, which is a carbonyl, that peak is expected. So nothing unusual there, but it confirms the presence of a carbonyl.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The first thing to note is that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or any protons on double bonds. That makes me think—maybe the compound is fully saturated, no double bonds. Looking at the options, I don't see any with double bonds, so that's consistent.

Now, the NMR signals: there's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but I think it's about the splitting patterns. Splitting in NMR happens due to neighboring protons. Each split indicates the number of adjacent protons. Let's break down the terms.

A doublet is split into two peaks—so one neighboring set of protons. A triplet would come from two neighboring protons. Wait, no, wait: the number of splits is n+1, where n is the number of neighboring protons. So a doublet means n=1 (one neighboring proton), triplet is n=2, quartet n=3, etc.

But when you have more than one neighboring group, the splitting gets more complex. So a doublet of doublets would be two different neighboring groups each causing a split. Similarly, a doublet of triplets would be a proton split into a doublet by one group, and each peak in that doublet is further split into triplets by another group.

Let me consider each structure and think about what the NMR would look like.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So structure-wise, this would be something like:

CH2CH3 groups attached to a central carbon, which is attached to two CH groups. Wait, no. Let me draw it. The formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

Wait, the central part is probably two CH groups connected to a central carbon or maybe a geminal arrangement? Wait, the formula seems to have two C(H)(C2H5) groups. So let's imagine the structure as:

The main chain is CH2COOH at the end, and before that, there's a central part where each of two adjacent carbons is attached to a methyl (CH3) and an ethyl (C2H5) group. So it's like a geminal diethyl group on a carbon, but wait, no. Let me parse the formula correctly.

Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H
