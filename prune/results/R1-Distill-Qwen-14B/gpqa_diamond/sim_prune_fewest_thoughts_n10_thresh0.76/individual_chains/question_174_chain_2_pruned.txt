Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

So, the problem is about an atomic nucleus undergoing spontaneous fission. The nucleus is initially at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. When it splits, it forms two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We're told to find the difference between the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) as calculated using the correct relativistic approach versus the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to compare two approaches: the classical (non-relativistic) and the relativistic. The question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. The options are in MeV, with A being 2 MeV and so on.

First, let's outline what I know. In a typical fission reaction, the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei and possibly some neutrons or other particles, but the problem states that nothing else is formed, so it's just two fragments.

Given:
- Mass of initial nucleus: M (rest-mass energy 300 GeV).
- After fission, two fragments: one has twice the rest mass of the other. Let's say the less massive one has mass m, so the more massive is 2m.
- Sum of rest masses is 0.99 M. So, m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So, the masses are m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M.

Wait, so total rest mass after is 0.99 M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = M/3.333... So, the two fragments have masses 0.3 M and 0.6 M? Wait, 0.333... M is m, 0.666... M is 2m.

Wait, no, because 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. Hmm, wait, 0.33 M is about a third. So masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. Their sum is 0.99 M, which matches the given condition.

But wait, the initial rest mass is 300 GeV. So, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, but the total rest energy after fission is 0.99 * 300 GeV? Because the rest mass is M, so 300 GeV is Mc². The rest masses of the products sum to 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV.

Wait, so the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, and the combined rest energy of the two fragments is 297 GeV. So, the difference is 3 GeV. That must be the energy
