Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude of the field is 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. The task is to find the integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Wait, I remember that vector calculus identities might come in handy here. Oh right, there's Gauss's Law, which relates the divergence of a vector field to the flux through a surface. But wait, Gauss's Law is usually applied to electric fields, but maybe the same principle applies here since it's about the divergence.

So, the divergence theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field over a region is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that region. So ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector to the surface.

In this case, the surface is a sphere of radius R. And the vector field f has only a radial component, so the flux calculation might be simpler. Since the field is radial, the flux through the sphere should just be the surface area multiplied by the radial component of the field at r=R.

Wait, the field f is given as 1/r². So at r=R, the magnitude is 1/R². And since it's radial, the dot product of f and the normal vector (which is also radial) is just f * 1 (since the normal is in the same direction as f). So the flux is f(R) multiplied by the surface area of the sphere.

The surface area of a sphere with radius R is 4 π R². So flux is (1/R²) * 4 π R² = 4 π.

But wait, the question is about the volume integral of the divergence, which by the divergence theorem equals the flux. So the integral should be 4 π.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let's think. The problem says the vector field has a magnitude of 1/r² and only a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, f(r) would be (f_r, 0, 0) where f_r = 1/r².

So what's the
