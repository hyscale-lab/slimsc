Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. The spins are S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. And I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Beta is 1/(kT). So each state contributes exp(-beta E) to Z.

First, I need to find all possible states of the system. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let's list them.

The states are all combinations of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1. Like (++,+), (++,-), (+,-,+), etc. Wait, maybe I should represent each state as a triplet, like (s1, s2, s3), where each s is Â±1.

So, the eight states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E. Then compute exp(-beta E) for each, and sum them all for Z.

But wait, perhaps there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Maybe group them by their energy. Because some states will have the same energy.

Let me think about the energy expression E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So each term is S_i S_j, which is +1 if the spins are the same, and -1 if different.

So for a given state, the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is the sum of the products. Let's compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J * H.
