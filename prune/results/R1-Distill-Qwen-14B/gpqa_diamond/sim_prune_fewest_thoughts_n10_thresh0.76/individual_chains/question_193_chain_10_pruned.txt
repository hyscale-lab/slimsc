Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' or 'plx', right? So the formula given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. 

Wait, parallax and distance are related. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Oh wait, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. So d is 1/plx. 

The question is about how the number of stars, N, changes with distance, r, perhaps. So they're asking for dN/dr, the rate of change of number of stars with distance. But wait, the options are about how N depends on r, so I think it's about the dependence of N on r, not the derivative. Let me think again.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 

So 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5, which is the same as r^5, assuming r is the distance. So when r increases, N increases as r^5. 

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So does that mean the change in N with each increment of r, like the derivative? Or just the general trend? Because if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But the question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me reread it.

The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps they're asking for the dependence of N on
