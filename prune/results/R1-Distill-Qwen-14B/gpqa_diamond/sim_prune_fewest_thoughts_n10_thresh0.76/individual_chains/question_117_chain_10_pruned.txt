Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism arises when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they are not superimposable on their mirror images. So, I need to look at each of the given compounds and see if they have any chiral centers or if they can exhibit stereoisomerism.

The question lists four compounds and asks which ones show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining some of the four compounds. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so this looks like a biphenyl structure. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene ring, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. The biphenyl would have two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. Since it's a single bond, the rings can rotate. Wait, but if the substituents around the single bond are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could have a plane of symmetry or not. If the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it might be chiral.

Wait, another thought: the compound has two methyl ester groups. So, the structure is OMe groups attached to the carbons at 2 and 2' on each ring. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', so on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions, maybe? Or is it that each ring has one nitro group at 6 and each has a methyl ester at 2? Wait, no, the name is dimethyl, so two methyl ester groups. So, each phenyl ring has a COOCH3 group at position 2. And each has a NO2 group at position 6. So, the structure is two benzene rings connected at 1 and 1', each with substituents at 2 and 6 positions.

Wait, but since the rings are connected by a single bond, the substituents on each ring might create a situation where the entire molecule is chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has symmetry. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So
