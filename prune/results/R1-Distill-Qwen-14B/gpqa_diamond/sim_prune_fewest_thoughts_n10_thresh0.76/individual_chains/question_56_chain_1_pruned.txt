Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions are governed by the selection rules. Oh right, for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, n must change by one each time because it's a two-step process from 3 to 1.

Wait, so from n=3 to n=2 first, then from n=2 to n=1. Because you can't go directly from 3 to 1 in one step with a dipole transition; that would require Δn=2, which isn't allowed. So the decay must happen in two steps.

So the first transition is from 3s (n=3, l=0, m=0) to either a 2p state. Because l can only change by ±1. So l=0 → l=1. So the first state after transition would be a 2p state. 

What about the possible m values? For the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1. Since the initial m is 0, the next m could be -1, 0, or +1. So the possible states after first transition are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Now the second transition goes from n=2 to n=1. So again, l must change by ±1. So from l=1, the next l should be 0 because we're going to the 1s state (which is l=0). So the second transition must go from 2p to 1s.

But wait, the initial state after the first transition is one of the 2p states. Let's think about the possible m transitions from there. For each possible 2p state, what are the allowed m for the next state?

Wait, but the final state is |1,0,0⟩, so m can only be 0. So in the second transition, the m of the intermediate state must allow a change to m=0.

Let me outline the possible paths:

Option 1: 3s → 2p( m=0 ) → 1s(m=0)
Option 2: 3s → 2p(m=1) → 1s(m=0)
Option 3: 3s → 2p(m=-1) → 1s(m=0)

But wait, can the second transition from m=1 or m=-1 reach m=0? Because Δm can be 0, ±1.

Yes, because m can change by ±1. So from m=1, you can go to m=0. Similarly, from m=-1, you can go to m=0.

But wait, can a transition from m=1 to m=0 happen? Because the allowed Δm is ±1 or 0
