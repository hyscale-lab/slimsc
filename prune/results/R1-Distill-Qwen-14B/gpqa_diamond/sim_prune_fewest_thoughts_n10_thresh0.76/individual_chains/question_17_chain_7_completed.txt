Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, stochiometric means molar ratio is 1:1? So each mole of Ca-EDTA gives one mole of Ca²+ ions. But wait, wait a minute. Oh, but I think EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it forms a complex with Ca²+.

Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, not the complex. Because the complex itself is already 0.02 M, but the free calcium would be much less because it's part of the complex.

Oh right, the formation constant, K, is given as 5x10^10. The K for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. So the formation constant, Kf, is [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] ). 

Wait, but in this case, the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But the problem is, in solution, some of the EDTA might be free, but I'm assuming that the pH is ideal, so maybe the EDTA is in the right form to complex with Ca²+.

So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that all the Ca²+ comes from the dissociation of the complex, because the solution is at equilibrium.

Wait, no. Wait, the complex formation is a reversible reaction. So the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low because the K is very large (since Kf is 5e10, which is a big number, meaning the reaction goes almost to completion, so most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the equilibrium. The complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote:

Let’s say [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. But that can’t be right because some would dissociate. Wait, no. Wait, the solution is prepared with a 0.02 M concentration of the complex, but unless it's 100% dissociated, which it isn't because K is big but not infinite. Hmm, maybe I should set up an ICE table.

Wait, but wait. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the K expression. The Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But in this solution, the only source of Ca²+ is the dissociation of the CaEDTA complex. So let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Similarly, the concentration of free EDTA^4− would also be x, assuming that each dissociation gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−.

Wait, but wait, if the complex dissociates, each mole gives one mole of each. So if the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates by x, then the complex becomes 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because K is large). So the [Ca²+] is x, and [EDTA^4−] is x.

So plugging into Kf: (0.02)/(x * x) = 5e10.

Wait, that would be 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So solving for x²: x² = 0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) ) = 4e-13.

Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 4e-13 is 4 *1e-13, sqrt is 2 * 1e-6.5, which is 2 * (1e-6.5) → 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7? Because 10^−6.5 is about 3.16e-7, so 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the concentration of Ca²+.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought that [EDTA^4−] would be x, but EDTA can have different protonation states depending on pH. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I can assume that all the EDTA is in the form of EDTA^4−. So that part is okay.

So the calculation is correct. The concentration of free Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of free calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{f}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is expressed as:

\[
K_{\text{f}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, we assume that the dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the very large \( K_{\text{f}} \). Let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \( x \). At equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \quad \text{(since \( x \) is very small)}
\]
\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

Substituting into the \( K_{\text{f}} \) expression:

\[
K_{\text{f}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
