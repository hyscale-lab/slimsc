Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are given for each. I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve an acid reacting with a base to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is often measured, and for strong acids and bases, it's roughly constant, around -57 kJ/mol or so, but maybe in calories? Wait, the options have kcal and kJ, so I need to pay attention to units.

Wait, the problem is about calculating the enthalpy change when these three solutions are mixed. But wait, when you mix an acid with a base, they neutralize each other. But here we have two acids and one base. So perhaps I should figure out the equivalents of each acid and base to see how much neutralization occurs.

Let me break it down. First, find the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with HCl. It's a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+ ion. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. The concentration is 0.2 M. So moles = Molarity * Volume (L) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, but wait, does it completely dissociate in two steps? Well, for the purpose of neutralization, each mole can provide two H+ ions. But wait, considering the stoichiometry for neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 can neutralize two moles of OH-.

So for H2SO4, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Concentration is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives two H+ ions, the total H+ is 0.18 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2. This is a strong base. Each Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions. So the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So, moles of Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Concentration is 0.5 M. So moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives two OH-, so total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So now, we have H+ from HCl:0.1 mol, H+ from H2SO4:0.18 mol. Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

Wait, but neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH-
