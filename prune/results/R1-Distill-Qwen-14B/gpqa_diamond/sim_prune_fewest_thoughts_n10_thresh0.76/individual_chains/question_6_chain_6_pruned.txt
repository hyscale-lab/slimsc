Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ). The potential is given by V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. The question is asking for the energy spectrum, which I think refers to the possible energy levels the particle can have.

The options provided are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions involving quantum numbers n_x and n_y multiplied by some coefficients and then multiplied by ℏ*sqrt(k/m). Hmm, I need to figure out the correct expression.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two dimensions, it's helpful to separate the variables and see if the problem can be broken down into simpler parts. So, since the potential depends on r and θ, maybe I can separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts.

Wait, but wait, looking at the potential, it seems like it's a function of r² and cos²θ. So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor that a bit. Let me see: (1/2)k r² is just a term proportional to r squared, and the second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Wait, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that into the potential, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that: (3/2)*(1/2) = 3/4, so that term is (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Let me add the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) k r² is (5/4)k r². So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ.

Wait, but wait another moment. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write this as V(r,θ) = (k r²) [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can separate the potential into terms that depend only on r and terms that depend on θ. So, I can think of V(r,θ) = A(r) + B(r) C(θ), where A is just (1/2)k r², and B(r) is (3/2)k r², and C(θ) is cos²θ.

Wait, but the way the potential is set up, it's V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.
