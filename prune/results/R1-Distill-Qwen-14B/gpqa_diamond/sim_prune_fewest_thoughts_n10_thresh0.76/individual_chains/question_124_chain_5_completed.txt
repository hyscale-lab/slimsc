Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about particles being collided in a detector. The setup is that these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one-third of them reach the inner walls of the detector, which has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how far they travel before decaying. Oh wait, because they're fast-decaying particles, right? So their decay time is very short, and whether they reach the detector walls depends on their speed and lifetime.

Wait, the key here is probably the concept of time dilation in relativity. Because the particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime. So, if a particle has a proper lifetime tau, in the lab frame, it's gamma times tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the particles are produced at the center of the detector, and they move outward. Whether they reach the walls depends on whether their lifetime in the lab frame allows them to travel the radius of the detector.

So let's model this. The particles are produced at the center, so the distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is 30 meters. Their speed is v, which is very close to c since they're ultra-relativistic. So, approximately, v ≈ c.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed = 30 m / c.

But the particle will only travel this distance if its lifetime T is longer than t. Because if T is less than t, it decays before reaching the wall.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is T = gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. So T must be greater than t. So gamma tau > t.

Wait, but in the current situation, with gamma 20, one-third of the particles reach the walls. So, the fraction that reach is the probability that T > t. So, the probability that gamma tau > t is 1/3. Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the decay follows an exponential distribution, and the probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, I think particles have a probability of decaying over time. The decay follows an exponential law. The number of particles remaining at time t is N(t) = N0 * exp(-t/tau'). Where tau' is the mean lifetime, which is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau'), because time dilates.

Wait, the proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. So tau' = gamma tau.

So the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it takes to reach the wall. So, P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no. Wait, the time it takes to travel 30 meters is t = 30 m / (v). Since v is approximately c, t ≈ 30 / (3e8) seconds. Let me compute that: 30 / (3e8) is 1e-7 seconds, or 0.1 microseconds.

So the fraction reaching the walls is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), and this is given as 1/3 for gamma = 20.

So, when gamma is 20, P = 1/3 = exp(-t/(20 tau)).

We can write this as ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau).

So, - ln(3) = - t/(20 tau) → ln(3) = t/(20 tau) → t = 20 tau ln(3).

Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the lab frame. Because, in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation.

Let me denote the proper lifetime as tau. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

The time taken to reach the wall is t = 30 / (gamma c). Wait, because v is approximately c, and gamma is the Lorentz factor, which for ultra-relativistic particles, gamma is about E/(m c^2). But wait, no, v is approximately c, so gamma is about the same as E/(m c^2) if the kinetic energy is much larger than rest mass.

Wait, but maybe I should not get confused here. Let's think again.

The particles are moving at a speed v, which is relativistic. So, the time taken to reach the wall is t = R / v, where R is the radius of the detector, 30 meters.

In the lab frame, the lifetime of the particle is gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime (as measured in the particle's rest frame).

The probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t is P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)).

So, when gamma is 20, P is 1/3.

So,

1/3 = exp(- (R/(v)) / (gamma tau) )

Wait, but v is approximately c, so let's write v = c.

So,

1/3 = exp( - R / (gamma tau c) )

Take the natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - R / (gamma tau c )

So,

ln(3) = R/(gamma tau c )

So,

gamma tau c = R / ln(3)

When gamma is 20, the fraction is 1/3.

We want to find the gamma that gives P=2/3.

So, for the desired situation, the probability is 2/3.

So,

2/3 = exp( - R/(gamma' tau c) )

Take ln both sides:

ln(2/3) = - R/(gamma' tau c )

So,

R/(gamma' tau c ) = - ln(2/3) = ln(3/2 )

So,

gamma' tau c = R / ln(3/2 )

Wait, but from the previous case, when gamma was 20, we had gamma tau c = R / ln(3 )

So,

gamma' = gamma * (ln(3/2) / ln(3) )

Because,

gamma' = [ R/( tau c ) ] * [ 1/( ln(3/2) ) ]

But gamma was 20 = [ R/( tau c ) ] * ( 1 / ln(3) )

So,

gamma' = gamma * ( ln(3) / ln(3/2) )

Wait, let me check that.

We have,

gamma tau c = R / ln(3 )

gamma' tau c = R / ln(3/2 )

So,

gamma' = ( R / ( tau c ) ) * (1 / ln(3/2) )

But R/(tau c ) = gamma * ln(3 )

So,

gamma' = gamma * ln(3) / ln(3/2 )

Yes, that makes sense.

So, gamma' = gamma * [ ln(3) / ln(3/2) ]

Compute this ratio.

Compute ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So,

ln(3)/ln(3/2) ≈ 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.708

So,

gamma' ≈ 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

Looking at the options, option A is 54.

Wait, that would be the calculation.

So the answer is option A) 54.

But wait, let me double-check. Because when gamma is 20, P=1/3.

When gamma is higher, the probability increases because the lifetime increases, so more particles reach the wall. So we need a higher gamma than 20 to get a higher probability, which is 2/3. So the previous calculation shows gamma' is about 54, which is higher than 20. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is correct, but let me think again.

Wait, the initial condition is that for gamma=20, 1/3 of the particles reach the wall. So with a higher gamma, more particles reach. So 2/3 would require a larger gamma than 20, which option A is 54, which fits.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the particles' lifetime, their speed, and the detector's radius. The particles are ultra-relativistic, so their speed is approximately the speed of light, \( v \approx c \). The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector walls is \( t = \frac{R}{v} \), where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the detector's radius.

The probability that a particle reaches the walls is given by the exponential decay formula:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \( t = \frac{R}{c} \). For the given case where \( \gamma = 20 \), one-third of the particles reach the walls, so \( P = \frac{1}{3} \). This gives:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma \tau c}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{\gamma \tau c}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{R}{\gamma \tau c}.
\]

For the desired case where \( P = \frac{2}{3} \), we have:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma' \tau c}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{\gamma' \tau c}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{R}{\gamma' \tau c}.
\]

From the two equations, we can relate \( \gamma' \) to \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma' = \gamma \cdot \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

Using approximate values for the logarithms:

\[
\ln(3) \approx 1.0986, \quad \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055,
\]

we find:

\[
\gamma' \approx 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.708 \approx 54.16.
\]

Thus, the required Lorentz factor is approximately \( 54 \). This matches option A.

Answer: A
