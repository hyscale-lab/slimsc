Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, so the key here is probably about the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that. Because if they decay, they won't reach the walls. So the Lorentz factor affects how much time they have before decaying, and if they're moving fast enough, more can reach the walls.

Wait, but how does the Lorentz factor relate to the decay length? Oh right, the proper lifetime of the particle is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The particles need to travel a distance equal to the radius of the detector before decaying. So the decay length (gamma * beta * c * tau) should be at least the radius of the detector.

Wait, but why do I say that? Because if their lifetime is longer, they can travel further before decaying. So if the decay length is longer than the radius, more of them will reach the walls. So when the Lorentz factor increases, the decay length increases, meaning a higher chance they make it to the detector walls.

In the initial case, Lorentz factor gamma is 20, and one third (1/3) reach the walls. So when gamma increases, the fraction reaching the walls should increase. Because higher gamma means longer lifetime, so more particles make it.

Wait, the problem says that with gamma ~20, one third reach. The question is to find a gamma where two-thirds reach. So I need to find the new gamma that causes twice as many to reach the walls compared to before.

But wait, how does the fraction relate to the gamma? Because the fraction is the probability that the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the detector walls. So the fraction depends on the ratio between
