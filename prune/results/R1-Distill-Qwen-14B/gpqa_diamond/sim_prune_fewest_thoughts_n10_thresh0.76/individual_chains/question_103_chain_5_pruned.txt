Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, okay, let me start by breaking down the target molecule.

The target compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one), and on the phenyl ring, there are substituents: a bromo group at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. So benzene with substituents in positions 3 and 5. Wait, wait, numberingâ€”let me visualize the benzene ring. Let's say the ketone is at position 1. Then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, which are meta to each other relative to the ketone. So the ring has three substituents: the ketone (as a substituent), bromine at 3, nitro at 5.

Wait, actually, ethan-1-one is (CH3)C=O? No, wait, ethan-1-one is CH3CO-. So when attached to the benzene ring, it's a ketone substituent. So the benzene has a COCH3 group attached. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: COCH3 (which is from the ketone group), Br at position 3, and NO2 at position 5. So the positions are 3-bromo, 5-nitro, and 1 is the ketone.

Wait, no, numbering: if the ketone is attached at position 1, then the substituents are at 3 and 5. So the benzene ring has groups at 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So the substituents are meta to each other. So that's the structure.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene. So benzene needs to undergo several substitution reactions to get these groups attached.

Let me think about the possible steps.

First, the ketone group: that's a meta-direct
