Okay, so I've got this problem about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through. 

Alright, the question gives me a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral structure is a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, maybe it's a cubic system? Wait no, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal? No, wait, no. I think rhombohedral is part of the cubic system. Because in cubic systems, you can have simple, BCC, FCC, and rhombohedral (which is like a sheared cube). Oh right, so rhombohedral has all edges equal but the angles are not 90 degrees. Oh, right, so in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So each of the angles between the edges is 30 degrees. 

The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice? I think in a crystal, the interatomic distance 'a' is the length of the edge of the unit cell. So a = 10 Angstroms here.

The problem is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that for cubic systems, the interplanar distance d_hkl is calculated using the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, that's for a cubic system with all angles 90 degrees. But here, the crystal is rhombohedral, so the formula must be different.

Oh right! The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma_{hk} + hl \cos \gamma_{hl} + kl \cos \gamma_{kl}) ) } }

Wait, no, that's probably more complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2
