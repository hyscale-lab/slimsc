Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what this compound is based on the spectral data given. Let's break down each piece of information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is the highest mass, so the molecular weight is 156. The other peak at 158 is probably a fragment or maybe an isotope. Wait, wait, another possibility: sometimes you get peaks due to isotopic abundance. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance, right? Chlorine-35 is about 75%, Cl-37 is about 25%. So if the molecular formula has a Cl, the molecular ion would have a certain mass, and the M+2 would be higher by 2 (since Cl-37 is 2 amu higher than Cl-35). Let's see: if the molecular weight is 156 and Cl is present, then M would be 156, and M+2 would be 158. So the 32% at 158 might be the Cl-37 peak, which aligns with 25% abundance, but here it's 32%, which is a bit higher. Maybe there are two Cl atoms? Let me check.

Wait, no, because if there were two Cls, M would be 156, and M+2 would be 158, but the abundance of each Cl-37 would be about 25% each, so the M+2 would be (0.25)^2 = 6.25%? That doesn't add up. Maybe the 158 is a fragment, not an isotope. Alternatively, maybe it's an M+2 where one Cl is present, so 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So the M would be 156 (Cl-35), and M+2 would be 158 (Cl-37). So 25% of the M would be at 158? But in the data, the M at 156 is 100%, and the 158 is 32%, which is more than 25%. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Maybe the molecular formula includes another element with isotopes. Or maybe it's a fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is Cl-containing, and the M is 156, so M+Cl37 is 158, but the 32% is not exactly 25% because of possible other factors. Maybe I'll come back to this after looking at other data.

Next, the IR spectrum. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H stretches. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. 1
