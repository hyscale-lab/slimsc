Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. It's a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes. Tube 1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, which probably absorbs moisture. Tube 2 has a Ca(OH)2 solution, which is a base and would react with acidic gases. Tube 3 has red-hot copper, which would react with certain gases like maybe sulfur dioxide or something else. The results are that tubes 1 and 3 gained 3.60g and 0.80g respectively. Tube 2 didn't change. And finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

Hmm. So the first thing I need to figure out is what the gases are and how they react in each tube. Let's break down each part.

The initial mixture is salts A and B, which when heated produce some gases. The fact that they're heated without air suggests it's a thermal decomposition. So maybe the salts are losing water of crystallization or releasing some volatile components.

The first tube, №1, is Mg(ClO4)2, anhydrous. I know that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, so it probably absorbs water. So the gas that passed through here caused the tube to gain 3.60g. That suggests that the gas was water vapor, H2O, because Mg(ClO4)2 would attract and retain water. So the increase in weight is the mass of water absorbed. Let's calculate how much H2O that is.

The mass of H2O is 3.60 grams. The molar mass of H2O is (2*1 + 16) = 18 g/mol. So moles of H2O = 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

So 0.2 moles of H2O were absorbed by tube 1. That suggests that the initial gases included H2O vapor.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change, meaning no reaction. So the gas that passed through here didn't react with Ca(OH)2. What gases don't react with Ca(OH)2? Well, Ca(OH)2 is a base, it reacts with acids, but not with non-acidic gases. For example, CO2 would react with it, forming CaCO3 and water. But if tube 2 didn't change, the gases after tube 1 didn't contain CO2 or something else that would react with Ca(OH)2. Or perhaps the gas passed through without reacting.

Wait, but after tube 1, any H2O would have been absorbed, so the gas entering tube 2 would be the remaining gases. Let me think. If tube 2 didn't change, maybe the gas was something inert, like nitrogen or noble gases, but in this context, maybe it's another gas that doesn't react.

Then, tube 3 has red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. So the gas that reacted here must be something that reacts with hot copper. Common gas that does that is CO2 or maybe SO2. Wait, SO2 reacts with copper at high temps? Or perhaps it's CO? Let me think.

Wait, when CO2 is passed over hot copper, does it react? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, SO2 would react with copper at high temperatures to form CuS or something, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's H2S, but that's more of a reaction with copper in other conditions.

Wait, another thought: when CO2 is passed over red-hot copper, perhaps it doesn't react. But wait, when CO is present, it can react with copper. Alternatively, maybe the gas is hydrogen sulfide, but that seems less likely here.

Alternatively, considering that tube 3 gained 0.80g, and formed CuO, perhaps the reaction is with H2S. Wait, no, H2S would react with CuO, but that's a solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is CO, which could react with copper. Let me think about the reaction. CO is a reducing agent and can react with CuO. For example, CO can reduce CuO to Cu, but that's usually under specific conditions. Wait, but in this case, it's the other way around: the gas is passing over red-hot copper. So perhaps the gas is something like SO2, which can react with copper to form CuS, but I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the
