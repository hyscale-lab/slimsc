Okay, so I have this genetics question to solve. Let me read through it carefully and figure out what's going on.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the target gene sequences.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means the gene product (a protein) is causing the issue, and we need a mutation that disrupts its function. So, the mutation should create a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein, or maybe a nonfunctional protein.

Looking at the wild-type and mutant sequences... the question shows the gene sequences. I notice that the target is the beginning of the first exon, so all mutations are in exon 1.

Let me compare each mutant to the wild-type sequence.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So that's the wild type.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, looking at the beginning. Wildtype has TTTCTCG..., mutant 1 has TCTACGCT...

Wait, let me line them up:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

So I think in mutant1, the sequence after ATG is TTC instead of TTT. Then, after that, it's TAC instead of CTC. Wait, so let me count the positions.

Wild-type position 4: T, so the first part is ATG TTT... So in mutant1, the first change is at the third T to C? Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's easier to see where the changes are. Let me break it down:

Wild-type Exon 1:
Positions 1-1
