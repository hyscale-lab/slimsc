Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the question has two parts, A and B. The first part is a reaction involving a 1,5-diene, and the second part is a Cope rearrangement under heat.

Let's start with the first reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+.

BuLi is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating something. The molecule given is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an ether group. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. Let me visualize that structure. The benzene ring has a -O-CH2- group attached. The oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Breaking that down: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, wait â€” wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So, 3-methyl but-2-en-1-yl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon? Wait, but but is four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, but the numbering might be different. Let me see: 1-yl is the end where the substitution is. So for but-2-en-1-yl, it's CH2=CHCH2-CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me sketch it.

But-2-en-1-yl group: the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. The substituent is at position 1. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 2 and
