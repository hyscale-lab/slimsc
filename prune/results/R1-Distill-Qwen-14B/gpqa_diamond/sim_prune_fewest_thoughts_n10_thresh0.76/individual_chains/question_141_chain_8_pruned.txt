Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to think it through.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, wait... Oh, wait, I think I read that wrong. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Wait, no, the way it's written is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, maybe the "d" stands for something else, like a deuterium? Hmm, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the compound is 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not sure. Wait, benzene-2-d... Oh, maybe it's 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene. No, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes "d" can mean a substituent like methyl, but I'm not certain. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about elimination or substitution. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Condensed ammonia solvent usually refers to liquid ammonia, which is a good solvent for such reactions.

So the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, perhaps it's 2-dimethylamino-bromobenzene? If the "d"
