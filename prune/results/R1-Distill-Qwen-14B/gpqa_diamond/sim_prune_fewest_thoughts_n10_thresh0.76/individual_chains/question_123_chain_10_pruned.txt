Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta part and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The problem asks what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, so we're dealing with relative motion and reference frames here. I remember something about time dilation and length contraction from special relativity, but wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's just a straightforward velocity problem without relativity effects? Or maybe not. Let's think.

Wait, but the question is about how far the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, this is probably a problem involving the relativity of simultaneity or time differences between frames.

Let me break it down. Let's denote the Galaxy's frame as S and the ejecta's frame as S'. So in S', the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So the speed u between the frames is 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in which direction?

In the S (Galaxy) frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed between S and S' is 60,000 km/s. So the velocity of S' (ejecta) relative to S is u = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, no, the problem says from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So in S', the Galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the center (so the same direction, but opposite in frame S').

Now, the key is to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in S', the time elapsed is 50 seconds. We need to find the corresponding time in S, then multiply by the speed to get the distance
