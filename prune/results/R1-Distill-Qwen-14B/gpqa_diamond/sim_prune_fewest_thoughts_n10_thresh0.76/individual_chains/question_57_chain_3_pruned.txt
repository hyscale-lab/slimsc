Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude plays a big role. The question gives me several phase shifts, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, phase shifts... Oh right, in the context of scattering theory, especially for partial waves, the scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of these phase shifts. The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) involves a sum over all the angular momentum states, each contributing a term with the corresponding phase shift.

I think the general expression is something like f(θ) = (1/(2i)) * ∑ [ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ) * (2l+1) * (sin lθ) ) ] ... but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some parts. Oh wait, no, perhaps I should think about the partial wave expansion. The scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over l of ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) / (2ik) ) * (2l+1) * (Pl(cosθ)) ), where Pl is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the problem asks specifically for the direction along the incident beam, which I think corresponds to θ=0 degrees. Because when the scattering angle is zero, the particles are moving along the same direction as the incident beam.

So when θ is zero, cosθ is 1, and Pl(1) is 1 for all l. Because Pl(1) = 1 for any l. That simplifies things a lot. So the sum becomes sum over l of [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) ) / (2ik) ].

But wait, the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So the given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°. So l goes from 0 to 4. But wait, what's the value of each l? Oh, right, each δl is the phase shift for angular momentum l. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So I'll need to compute each term for l=
