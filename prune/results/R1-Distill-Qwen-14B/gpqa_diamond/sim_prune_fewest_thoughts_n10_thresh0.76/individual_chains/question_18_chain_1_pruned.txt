Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. A bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. They've used the Equivalent Width (EW) method under LTE to determine the elemental abundances. The given data are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so (nSi_1 / nSi_2).

Hmm. Okay, I think I remember that [X/Y] denotes the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait, no, wait. The definition I remember is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_star = log( (nX/nY)_star / (nX/nY)_sun ) = log( (nX/nY)_star ) - log( (nX/nY)_sun )

But wait, the way the problem is given, for example, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So that would mean that log(nFe_1/nH_1) - log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) = 0. So log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun). So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. So their Fe/H ratio is same as Sun. Wait, no, because for [Fe/H], it's the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is zero, then Fe/H is equal to solar Fe/H.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (Mg/H)_
