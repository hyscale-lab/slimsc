Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the energy spectrum for a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. Let me read the question again carefully.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²(θ). Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in two dimensions, the type of potential can dictate what kind of solutions we have. Oh wait, maybe this potential can be broken down into components that we can handle with familiar techniques.

Let me think about the form of the potential. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions, because the 2D harmonic oscillator has V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², but here it's kr² over 2. Then the second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, cos squared theta suggests some angular dependence, perhaps related to an anisotropic oscillator or maybe a potential that varies with the angle.

Wait, but in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a 2D system is usually expressed as H = p²/(2m) + V(r,θ). So, for our case, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out the common terms. So, V(r,θ)= (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, so it's a combination of a radial term and an angular term.

Wait a second, maybe I can rewrite this as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me think, cos²θ can be expressed using the double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ]
= (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ
= [ (1/2 + 3/4)k r² ] + (3/4)k r² cos2θ
= (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r²) cos2θ.

Hmm, that might not immediately help. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Wait, in two dimensions, using polar coordinates, but perhaps it's easier to switch to Cartesian coordinates to analyze the potential.

So, r is the radius, and θ is the angle. The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express the potential in terms of x and y.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, and thus cos²θ = x²/(r²). So substituting back into V(r,θ):

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r²
