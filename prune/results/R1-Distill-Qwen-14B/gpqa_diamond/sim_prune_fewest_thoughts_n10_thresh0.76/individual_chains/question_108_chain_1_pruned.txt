Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that paramagnetism is related to the interaction of an atom's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field. The term here is the paramagnetic coupling, which I think is the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment and B is the magnetic field.

Wait, but what's μ for an electron in an atom? Oh right, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (eħ/(2m)) * L, where g is the Landé g-factor, e is the charge, ħ is h-bar, and m is the mass of the electron. Oh, but wait, orbital magnetic quantum number m is involved here. The problem says small values of m, so I think m is much less than the maximum possible, which for a given l is m = -l, ..., l.

The magnetic field B is 1 Tesla. Hmm, that's a strong field, but not extremely so. I think the Earth's magnetic field is about 0.5 Gauss, so 1 T is much stronger. But how does that compare to the typical magnetic fields in atoms?

The transition energy ΔE of hydrogen is given with a wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. That's the wavelength of the Balmer series transition, specifically the H-alpha line, which corresponds to the transition between n=3 and n=2, I think. Let me calculate ΔE for that transition.

The energy levels in hydrogen are given by E_n = - (13.6 eV) * (1/n²). So for n=3 and n=2, the energies are E3 = -1.511 eV and E2 = -3.4 eV. The transition energy ΔE is the difference between these: 3.4 - 1.511 = 1.889 eV. Wait, no, wait. ΔE is the energy of the photon emitted. Hmm, let me get this right. E_upper is higher (closer to zero) than E_lower. So when an electron drops from n=3 to n=2, the energy is E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV, but the photon's energy would be positive, so 1.889 eV. So ΔE = hc/λ, but wait, I can calculate it using the wavelength.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using the wavelength. The wavelength λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. The energy is given by ΔE = hc/λ. Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, but 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So let's compute ΔE in eV. So hc is 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by λ = 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = approximately 4.087e-19 J. Convert J to eV: 4.087e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, wait a minute, that doesn't match with the earlier calculation. Because when I did E3 to E2, I got about 1.889 eV. Hmm, something's off here. Oh wait,
