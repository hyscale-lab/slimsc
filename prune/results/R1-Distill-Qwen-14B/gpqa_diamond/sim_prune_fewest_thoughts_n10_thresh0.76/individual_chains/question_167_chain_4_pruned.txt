Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The non-Gaussianity (nG) is defined using the relative entropy formula delta_b, which is the difference between the traces of rho ln rho and tau ln tau, where rho is the density matrix of the state and tau is that of a Gaussian reference state.

Hmm, right. So first, I need to understand what non-Gaussianity measures. From what I remember, Gaussian states are those that have a Wigner function which is Gaussian, like coherent states or squeezed states. Non-Gaussian states deviate from this, and the non-Gaussianity quantifies how much a state differs from a Gaussian one.

The given state is a superposition of two coherent states, |alpha> and |-alpha>. Wait, but wait. Coherent states are Gaussian, right? But their superpositions can be highly non-Gaussian, especially when the amplitudes are equal. Oh, like the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two macroscopically distinct coherent states. So this state is definitely non-Gaussian.

But the question is asking for the relative entropy measure. So I need to compute the density matrices for rho and tau, then calculate delta_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau).

Wait, wait. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the state and the closest Gaussian state. But wait, I remember that for some states, the closest Gaussian state might not be unique, but in this case, the reference Gaussian state is given. So I just need to compute delta_b as specified.

So let's break it down.

First, construct the density matrix rho for |psi>.

The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N.

Given phi = -pi/4, so cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(phi) = sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state becomes [0.7071 |alpha> - 0.7071 |-alpha> ] / N.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let's calculate N.

Phi is -pi/4. So 2 phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Calculate exp(-2*(0.
