Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene and ending up with product 3. Then, we need to determine the molecular symmetry group (point group) of product 3.

First, let me outline the reactions step by step to figure out what each product is.

1. Toluene is treated with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). I remember that nitration reactions typically occur in such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, which is a meta-directing group. So when toluene undergoes nitration, the nitro group (-NO2) will be added in the meta position relative to the methyl group. So product 1 should be nitrotoluene, specifically meta-nitrotoluene, I think. Wait, wait, toluene is methyl benzene. The nitration would add the nitro group in the meta position. So structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group in the 1 and 3 positions, or 3 and 5? Hmm, let me think. Toluene's methyl is at position 1. Nitration would occur at position 3 or 5. So the product is 1-methyl-3-nitrobenzene, right? So product 1 is m-nitrotoluene.

Moving on. Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I'm trying to remember what happens when nitrotoluene is oxidized with MnO2 and H2SO4. Oh, I think that the methyl group adjacent to the nitro group gets oxidized. Wait, nitrotoluene is a nitro-substituted benzene with a methyl group. The nitro group is a meta director, but when it's attached to the ring, the methyl is at the ortho and para positions to the nitro. So when it's oxidized, the methyl group (which is an activating group) is oxidized. Wait, wait, but the nitro group is deactivating. So the methyl is attached to the ring, and the nitro is in the meta position. So the methyl
