Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to figure out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see.

Wait, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is needed here for the relative speed.

So, one of them is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c. But wait, which one is moving faster? Since they're both in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but not just subtracting like in classical mechanics. I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

The formula for relative velocity u' between two objects moving at u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Let me make sure I got that right. Oh wait, actually, the formula is (u - v) / [1 - (u v)/(c²)]. So I have to plug in u and v correctly.

Wait, which one is u and which is v? Let's say astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or vice versa. Wait, the question asks for the relative speed between the two, so the order might matter. Oh wait, if they're both moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by 1 minus (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's calculate that.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c when rounded. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that's the v_rel part.

Now for the total energy. Wait, the total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. So each one's energy is gamma * m * c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for him: 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.36 c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25 c²)/c²) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = approximately 5.964 m c². So around 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and the correct relative speed of 0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The two astronauts are moving in the same direction at speeds \( 0.6c \) and \( 0.5c \). The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to find the relative speed \( v_{\text{rel}} \):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} = 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer:
From the calculations, the relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
