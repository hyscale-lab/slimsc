Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because equilibrium problems can get tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a solution that contains two different phosphates. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I remember is 0.2 liters. The two substances added are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, each with 1.00 grams. Their molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively.

Hmm, so I think I should start by calculating the moles of each substance. Moles are grams divided by molecular weight, right?

For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by approximately 136 is around 0.00735 moles. Wait, more accurately, 1/136.09 is about 0.007339 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. So 1/178 is roughly 0.005618 moles. Let me check: 177.99 is almost 178, so 1/178 is about 0.005618. Yeah.

So now I have the moles of each. But wait, what are these compounds when dissolved? KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, right? 

So, the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 would be 0.007339 mol, and the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 would be 0.005618 mol.

Wait, but the solution is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations would be (moles) / 0.2 L. Let me compute that.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007339 / 0.2 = approximately 0.036695 M.
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 / 0.2 = about 0.02809 M.

Now, I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. The species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-, and their concentrations depend on the dissociation constants.

The given Ka values are:
Ka1 = 7.5e-3 (first dissociation of H3PO4),
Ka2 = 6.2e-8 (second dissociation),
Ka3
