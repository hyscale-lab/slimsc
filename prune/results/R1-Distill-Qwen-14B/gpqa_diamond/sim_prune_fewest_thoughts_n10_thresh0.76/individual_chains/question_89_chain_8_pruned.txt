Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read through it carefully. The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and then several steps leading to product 3. I need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's break it down step by step. 

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, giving product 1 as a light yellow solid. The product's 1H NMR has specific peaks, and IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Let's think about what reaction would this be. KOH is a strong base, so maybe an elimination reaction? Since it's dibromide, perhaps dehydrohalogenation occurs. Heating with KOH might lead to forming an alkene via elimination. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and if it's 1,3-dibromo, eliminating two bromides would form a double bond. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests an ester or ketone. Oh, wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, 1720 cm⁻¹ is more indicative of an ester or possibly a ketone. But if elimination happened, maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene, but that doesn't directly explain the IR. Alternatively, if it's a substitution, like forming a diol. Wait, but with KOH, heating—maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene, but that doesn't explain the IR. Hmm.

Wait, wait, let's think again. When dibromides react with KOH, especially in elimination, they form alkenes. But in this case, the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but an elimination followed by something else. Or maybe it's a substitution to form a diol. Diols would have OH groups, but the IR of a diol would have broad peaks around 3300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of substitution.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation with a neighboring group participation. Alternatively, could it be a dieckmann-type elimination if it's cyclic? But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged structure. Wait, adamantane is a bicyclic structure, so the 1,3-dibromide would be across the bridge. Heating with KOH would likely cause elimination to form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are usually not possible due to Bredt's rule. So maybe it's not elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution to form a diol, but that would give a diol with two OH groups.

But the IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720. That's more of a carbonyl group. Hmm, so
