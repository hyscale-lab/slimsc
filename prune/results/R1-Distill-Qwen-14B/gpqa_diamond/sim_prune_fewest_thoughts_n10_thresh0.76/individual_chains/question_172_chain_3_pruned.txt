Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of energy levels in atoms can be described by the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level ratio is n1/n2 = 2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think I remember that the probability of an atom being in a higher energy state is related to temperature. 

The Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The formula is n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Since E_i is higher for the excited state, E_i - E_j is positive. 

In this case, the energy difference is the same for both stars, so E_i - E_j = ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. For star 1, the ratio n1/n2 is 2. So:

n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) = 2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratio is n1/n2 = 2. But in the Boltzmann equation, if ΔE is the energy difference between two levels, say E_upper - E_lower, then for a transition from lower to upper, the ratio would be n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). 

So here, the excited state is higher, so the ratio should be n_excited/n_ground. Which in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n1 is the excited state population, n2 is the ground. So n1/n2 = 2. 

So for star_1: (n1)_1 / (n2)_1 = 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

For star_2: (n1)_2 / (n2)_2 = 1 (since it's twice in star_1) ? Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So star_1 has more excitation. So n1_1 = 2 * n1_2, because it's twice as excited. Or wait, I'm getting confused with the wording. Let me read it again.

It says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 (n1) is twice that in star_2 (n2). So n1 = 2 * n2. 

So for star_1: n1_1/n2_1 = 2. But wait, n2_1 is the ground state population for star_1. Similarly, n2_2 is the ground state for star_2. 

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio for each star. 

For star 1: (n_upper)/(n_lower
