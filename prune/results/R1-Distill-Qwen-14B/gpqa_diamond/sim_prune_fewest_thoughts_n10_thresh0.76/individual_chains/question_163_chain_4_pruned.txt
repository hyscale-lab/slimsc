Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and a sparingly soluble salt. When it dissolves in an acid, the H+ ions from the acid will react with the OH- ions from the Fe(OH)3, effectively lowering the pH and helping the Fe(OH)3 to dissolve. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So, the acid will provide the H+ ions needed to dissolve the hydroxide.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The mass given is 0.1 grams. I think I should calculate the number of moles here. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, and each OH is 17.01 g/mol. So, Fe(OH)3 has a molar mass of 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.000935 moles. Let me write that as approximately 9.35e-4 mol.

When Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it produces Fe^3+ and OH- ions. The reaction with the strong acid, let's say it's HCl for simplicity, would be 1:3 in terms of mole ratio. Because each Fe(OH)3 molecule requires 3 H+ ions to completely dissolve. So, moles of H+ needed would be 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. That's 3 * 0.000935 ≈ 0.002805 mol.

The strong acid is monobasic, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. So, the volume needed (V) is moles / concentration. That would be 0.002805 mol / 0.1 mol/cm³ = 0.02805 liters, which is 28.05 cm³. Wait, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³, and its pH is 2.04. But I think I need to check if that's the correct minimum volume and then find the pH.

Wait, but I also need to consider the dilution and any possible hydrolysis after the solution. Let me think. After adding the acid, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions, which might hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic. So, the pH will depend on this hydrolysis.

The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³, so after adding V cm³ of acid, the total volume becomes 100 + V cm³. Or wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so I think V is the volume added, and the total is 100 cm³. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me read the question again. It says, "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after dissolving is 100 cm³. So, the initial volume is 100 cm³. But the acid is added to this solution, so when we add V cm³ of acid, the total volume becomes 100 + V? Or is the solution made up to 100 cm³ after adding the acid?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The process is that we have a 100 cm³ solution, and we're adding some volume of acid to it. So the total volume after adding the acid will be more than 100 cm³. But wait, the question says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." Hmm. Perhaps the acid is added to the 100 cm³ solution. So the total volume remains approximately 100 cm³ (if the acid volume is small compared to 100 cm³). Or maybe the acid is added, and the total solution is still 100 cm³. That might complicate things.

Wait, I think the problem is that the solution after dissolving is
