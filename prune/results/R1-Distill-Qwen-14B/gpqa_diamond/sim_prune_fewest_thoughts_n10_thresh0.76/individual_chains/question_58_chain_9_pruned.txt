Okay, so I've got this question here about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite results in calculations. So without regularization, these infinities pop up and mess things up. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then you remove the regulator in the end.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this. Let's go through each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell's equations and all that without quantum mechanics. Since it's classical, there shouldn't be any divergences of the quantum sort. I mean, in classical E&M, you can have issues like the infinite charge density at a point charge, but those are handled by other means, like the principle of superposition or maybe renormalization in a different sense. But wait, do you need regularization in classical theories? Regularization is a quantum field theory tool. Since classical theories don't have the same divergences that regularization addresses, D might be the right answer. But let me check the others.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory. I know that in QED, you have processes like electron-positron pair production, and when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. So you have to regularize them, maybe using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, or something else. So QED definitely requires regularization; so option C is out.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's another quantum field theory, specifically a non-abelian gauge theory. Since it's a QFT, it has loop diagrams with divergences. I think QCD uses regularization too, especially because of things like running coupling constants and dealing with asymptotic freedom. So B needs regularization, so it's not the answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Hmm, superstring theory is a theory of quantum gravity, right? It's a candidate for a theory beyond the Standard Model. I
