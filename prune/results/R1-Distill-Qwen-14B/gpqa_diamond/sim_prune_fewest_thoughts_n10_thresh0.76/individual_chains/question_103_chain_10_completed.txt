Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each giving a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence is correct.

First, let me draw the target molecule in my mind. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the main structure is a ketone (ethan-1-one), attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene are bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So, the benzene ring has nitro in the para position and bromo in the meta position relative to the ketone group.

Wait, no, actually, let me think again. The substituents are on the phenyl group attached to the ethanone. So, the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl group. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment. So, the ethanone is at position 1, so the substituents are at 3 and 5. So, the benzene ring has nitro in position 5 and bromo in position 3.

Now, the synthesis starts with benzene. So, I need to figure out how to introduce the nitro group, the bromine, and the ketone group in the correct positions.

I remember that substituents introduced through electrophilic substitution reactions can direct subsequent reactions. Nitro groups are meta directors, and bromine is an ortho/para director. But wait, wait, the order in which substituents are introduced matters because each step affects the directing of the next substitution.

Let me outline the steps I think are needed:

1. Introduce a nitro group (since it's a strong meta director). But where? Wait, the nitro is at position 5. Hmm, but wait, how do we get substituents in specific positions when multiple groups are present.

Wait, perhaps the order of substituent introduction is important. Let me think about the substituent positions.

The target molecule has nitro at position 5, bromo at position 3, and the ketone at position 1 (attached to the ethanone). Wait, no, the ketone is at the position where the benzene ring is attached to the ethanone. So, the ethanone is at position 1, substituents are at 3 and 5.

So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ethanone at position 1 (as a ketone), bromine at 3, and nitro at 5. Wait, that's not possible because three substituents would require specific positions. But the positions 1,3,5 are meta to each other. So this structure has substituents at 1 (the ketone), 3 (bromo), and 5 (nitro). But wait, benzene can't have substituents in all three positions unless it's a tri-substituted benzene.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro) relative to the point where it's connected to the ethanone. So, the ethanone is attached to position 1 of the benzene ring, which is the only substituent, with bromo at 3 and nitro at 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone at position 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5. So, the three substituents are at 1,3,5 positions.

Wait, but three substituents in a benzene ring would require that each is in a specific position. So, benzene starts with just one substituent, then each new substituent is added based on the directing effects of the existing groups.

So, let's outline the steps needed:

1. Introduce the ketone group. Because the ketone is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG) and is a meta director. But wait, the ketone is an acyl group attached to the ring—so, once attached, it would direct incoming electrophiles to the meta position relative to itself.

Wait, but if I start by introducing the ketone first, then the next substituents would be added in the meta positions. But we have two substituents to add: bromine and nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group and bromine are introduced in a way that directs each other correctly.

Another approach: Let's consider the order of adding groups. The ethanone (from benzene) would be introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation, but wait, benzene itself can't undergo Friedel-Crafts because it's highly activating. Wait no, Friedel-Crafts acylation is done on activated aromatic rings. Benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts, but substituted benzene rings can't if they have deactivating groups. Wait, but if we add a substituent that's activating, then perhaps we can add more groups.

Wait, but benzene is the starting material. So, the first step probably involves adding a substituent, perhaps the nitro group or the ketone.

Wait, the ketone is an EWG, so it would deactivate the ring. So, after adding the ketone, adding other groups via electrophilic substitution would be difficult because the ring is deactivated. So, perhaps the ketone is added last, because if we add it early, the subsequent substitutions would be harder.

Wait, but maybe the ketone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation, which requires an activating group. So, perhaps we need a substituent that's activating to allow the Friedel-Crafts to proceed. Wait, nitro groups are deactivating, so if the ring has a nitro group, Friedel-Crafts won't work. Hmm, so maybe the order is to add the ketone before adding the nitro and bromine.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The target has a ketone attached to benzene. To introduce the ketone, we can use Friedel-Crafts acylation on benzene. Benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts, but wait, Friedel-Crafts isn't feasible on benzene because it's highly activating, but wait, benzene is activated enough? Oh wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation is for aromatic rings that are activated. Benzene itself can undergo Friedel-Crafts, but sometimes with difficulty compared to toluene or other rings. But let's say we proceed.

So step one: benzene -> benzophenone via Friedel-Crafts (using CH3COCl/AlCl3). Then, the benzophenone can undergo further substitution.

Wait, but the problem is that the ketone is a meta director. So, after adding the ketone, the next substituents would go into the meta position relative to the ketone. But in our target, the nitro and bromine are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So, perhaps both substituents are meta to the ketone.

Wait, but if the ketone is at position 1, then the nitro is at position 5 (meta), and bromo at position 3 (also meta). Wait, but position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and 4. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced first, then the bromine, then the ketone. But wait, nitro is a strong meta director. Let me think about the steps.

Option: Nitro group is introduced first. Then bromine is introduced in a position directed by the nitro group. Then the ketone is introduced in a position directed by the existing groups.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, so adding the ketone via Friedel-Crafts would be difficult. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced last. Because if the ring already has activating groups, then the ketone can be added via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but what's the order of substituent addition that allows all steps to proceed?

Let me outline the substituents and their directors:

1. Nitro group (EWG, meta director)
2. Bromine (EWG, ortho/para director)
3. Ketone (EWG, meta director)

But when you have multiple substituents, the most activating group (or the group that is a better director) will control the direction of the next substitution.

So, let's think about each option's steps.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation to add ketone)
ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination)
iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction, but not sure)
v) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration)
vi) NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization)
vii) H3PO2 (maybe reduction or something else)

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think about the steps.

But perhaps the steps are a mix of different functional group substitutions.

Wait, but let's consider the correct order to add substituents.

Another approach: the target has three substituents: a ketone, a nitro group, and a bromine. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Benzene → Nitrobenzene (nitration)
2. Nitrobenzene → Bromination at meta position relative to nitro (since nitro is meta director)
3. Then, introduce the ketone. Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won’t work. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added first. So:

1. Benzene → benzophenone (Friedel-Crafts)
2. Benzophenone → Nitration. Since the ketone is a meta director, nitro would add meta to ketone. So, position 3 or 5.
Wait, wait, benzophenone is a ring with a ketone at position 1. On nitration, the nitro would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3 or 5. But wait, there are two possible meta positions, so which one would it take?

Wait, benzophenone has a single substituent (the ketone). When you nitrate it, the nitro group would add to either the meta position. Let's say it adds at position 3.

Now, the ring has ketone at 1, nitro at 3.

Next, bromination would be directed by the nitro (which is a meta director) and the ketone (also a meta director). Hmm, but in this case, the ring has two meta directors. So, where would the bromine go?

Wait, but maybe in this case, the nitro group is the stronger director. So bromine would go into the position that's meta to the nitro group.

Wait, the nitro is at position 3. So bromine would go to position 6 (meta to nitro) or position 5 (ortho to nitro, but wait, nitro is meta director. Wait, no, nitro is a meta director, so the bromine would go to position 6 or position 2. Wait, but benzophenone's ketone is at position 1. So, substituents can't be at position 2 because that's adjacent to the ketone, which is an EWG. Hmm, maybe the bromine would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone (since the ketone is at 1, meta is positions 3 and 5). But wait, the nitro is already at 3. So, position 5 is meta to the ketone and para to the nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine ends up at position 5.

Wait, let me imagine the structure.

Positions are arranged as:

1 (ketone)
2
3 (nitro)
4
5 (bromo)
6

So, the ketone is at 1. Nitro is at 3 (meta to ketone). Then, adding bromine. Since nitro is a meta director, bromine would go to position 6, which is meta to the nitro. Wait, but that would be position 6, which is para to the ketone. Hmm, but the target has bromine at position 3 and nitro at 5. Wait, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add the bromine, then the nitro, then the ketone. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → benzene brominates, adding bromine.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

v) Fe/HCl → maybe a reduction step, like converting nitro to amine?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → maybe a reduction, like to form amine or something else.

Wait, but the target molecule has a ketone, so perhaps the Friedel-Crafts is needed to introduce the ketone. So, in option B, the ketone is introduced third.

But after adding bromine and nitro, the ring is deactivated. So, Friedel-Crafts acylation (step iii) may not proceed. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, but nitro and bromine are deactivating. So, that might not work. So, option B might not be correct.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine? Hmm, but that's not common with Fe/HCl. Wait, Fe/HCl is often for other reductions, maybe of nitro groups. But nitro to amine requires H2/Pd or something. Wait, maybe Fe/HCl is used in a different context.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: Fe/HCl is not a typical catalyst for nitration. Alternatively, perhaps it's for something else, like a substitution.

But after nitration (step i), the ring is nitro-substituted. Then step ii is Fe/HCl. Maybe that's for a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Then step iii is Friedel-Crafts acylation. But since the ring has a nitro group (deactivating), the Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So option C's step iii won't work. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → reduction, maybe to form an amine or hydroxylamine? Not sure.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

Wait, but again, I'm not sure. Let's think about the steps.

Option D starts with nitration, then something with Fe/HCl. Maybe Fe/HCl is for converting nitro to amine. But then, if the ring has an amine group, which is activating, then Friedel-Crafts can proceed. Let's walk through the steps.

Step i: benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → perhaps reduces nitro to amine. So now, the ring has an amino group (-NH2), which is a strong activating group. Step iii: NaNO2/HCl → forms diazonium salt. Step iv: H3PO2 → reduces diazonium salt to something. Wait, H3PO2 is typically used in the Stannous reduction, which can produce different products. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used in the hydroxide formation. Wait, in the presence of H3PO2, the diazonium salt could decompose to form a hydroxylamine or something else. Alternatively, in acidic conditions, maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, maybe step iv is a substitution where the amino group is replaced. For instance, if you have a diazonium salt and then treat with H3PO2, which is a reducing agent, perhaps you can get a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

Nitrobenzene → reduce to aniline (using H2/Pd or such, but Fe/HCl may not do that). Alternatively, maybe Fe/HCl is for something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a ketone group. So, the Friedel-Crafts acylation must happen at some point. But Friedel-Crafts requires an activated ring, like with an activating group. So, if the ring has an activating group, like an amine, then Friedel-Crafts can proceed.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce nitro group (step i in D).

2. Reduce nitro to amine (step ii in D: Fe/HCl might not be the right reagent, but let's assume it's a reduction step.

3. Then, perform some reaction that forms a leaving group, perhaps via diazotization (step iii: NaNO2/HCl), followed by substitution (step iv: H3PO2).

But I'm not entirely sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone.

Wait, but adding the ketone (Friedel-Crafts) after the nitro group is a problem because the ring is deactivated. So, perhaps the correct approach is to add the ketone first, then the nitro and bromine.

Wait, so let's think: First, benzene undergoes Friedel-Crafts acylation to form benzophenone (step i: CH3COCl/AlCl3).

Then, benzophenone undergoes nitration. Since the ketone is a meta director, nitro group will add to the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3 or 5.

Assuming nitro adds at position 3, then bromination would be directed by the nitro group (which is a meta director). So bromine would add at position 6 (meta to nitro). But the target has bromine at position 3.

Wait, this doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps after adding the ketone, nitration and bromination are done in a certain order.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Nitrobenzene → bromination → bromine adds at meta to nitro → let's say position 4 (but wait, nitro is at position 1, so meta would be positions 3 and 5).

3. Then, introduce the ketone. But wait, the ring has nitro and bromine, which are deactivating. So Friedel-Crafts won't work. So that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the ketone is introduced via a different method, but I don't think so. Friedel-Crafts is the standard way to introduce ketones onto aromatic rings.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced via a substitution of a leaving group. But benzene doesn't typically have leaving groups unless activated.

Alternatively, maybe the order is to first add the bromine, then the nitro group, and then the ketone.

So:

1. Benzene → bromination → bromobenzene.

2. Bromobenzene → nitration. Since bromine is an ortho/para director, nitration would add nitro at ortho or para to bromine.

But in the target, nitro is at position 5 relative to the ketone, which would be a meta position. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the positions. Suppose benzene is first nitrated, then brominated, then the ketone is introduced. But again, the ring would be deactivated for Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, maybe the correct order is:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduction of nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Friedel-Crafts acylation → introduces ketone. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group. So, when we do Friedel-Crafts on aniline, the ketone would add in the para position relative to the amine (since amine is a strong activating, ortho/para director).

Wait, but the target has the ketone at position 1, and the nitro and bromo at 3 and 5. So, perhaps after introducing the amine, the ketone adds in the para position relative to amine. But then, after acylation, the amine is still present, which may complicate further reactions.

But perhaps after introducing the ketone, we can eliminate the amine group. Alternatively, maybe the amine is converted into a nitro group again. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the target structure again. The substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (bromo), and 5 (nitro). So, it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Introduce nitro group at position 5.

2. Introduce bromine at position 3.

3. Introduce ketone at position 1.

But the problem is that after nitro and bromine are added, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, that's a problem.

Wait, but perhaps the ketone is introduced first, then the nitro and bromine. But then, the ketone is a meta director, so nitro would go to position 3 or 5, and bromine to positions directed by the ketone and nitro.

Wait, let's try:

Step 1: Benzene → benzophenone (Friedel-Crafts acylation).

Step 2: Benzophenone → nitration. Nitro group adds to position 3 (meta to ketone).

Step 3: Benzophenone with nitro at 3 → bromination. Now, the ring has ketone at 1 and nitro at 3.

Where does the bromine go? The nitro is a meta director, so bromine would go to position 6 (meta to nitro) or position 2 (ortho to nitro, but that's adjacent to the ketone, which is EWG).

Alternatively, the ketone is a meta director, so bromine would go to position 5 (meta to ketone). So, if the nitro is at 3, and the ketone at 1, adding bromine could go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the nitro.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents would be at 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), and 5 (bromine). That's exactly the target structure.

So, the order would be:

1. Acylation (Friedel-Crafts) to add ketone.

2. Nitration to add nitro at position 3.

3. Bromination to add bromine at position 5.

But wait, does that work in terms of directing effects?

When you have benzophenone, the ketone is a meta director. So, nitration should add the nitro group to the meta position, which is either position 3 or 5.

But in the target, the nitro is at 5, but wait, that depends on the order. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in the first substitution after acylation, the nitro group adds at position 3 (so, meta to ketone at 1), making the ring substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro).

Then, when you brominate, the ring has two substituents: ketone (1) and nitro (3). The nitro is a meta director, so bromine would go to position 6 (meta to nitro), but that's para to the ketone. Alternatively, the ketone is a meta director, so bromine would go to position 5 (meta to ketone), which is also ortho to nitro at 3.

But if the nitro is a stronger director, perhaps the bromine ends up at position 6.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group at ortho/para to bromine. Let's say it adds at position 3.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts to add ketone. But the ring has bromine and nitro, which deactivate the ring. So, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed. So, option B is unlikely.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → benzophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → ?

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again?

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → ?

Wait, but after acylation, the ring has a ketone. Then bromination would add bromine at meta to ketone. Then nitration would add nitro at meta to ketone, but perhaps in a position that's already occupied.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromination and nitration are done in such a way to get both substituents.

Wait, but in option A, after acylation, bromine is added, then nitration. So, benzophenone → bromophenone → nitration.

Wait, but the nitration step would be directed by both the ketone and the bromine.

Wait, the ketone is a meta director, and bromine is an ortho/para director. So, the nitration would probably be directed by the more powerful director. Which is stronger? The bromine is an EWG but is an ortho/para director. The ketone is also an EWG and a meta director.

Hmm, but in a ring with two substituents, the substituents that are more activating (or less deactivating) would direct better. Both are EWGs, but perhaps the ketone is a stronger deactivator. So, the nitration would be directed by the bromine.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, but the ketone is also deactivating. Hmm, perhaps the directing depends on their positions.

Wait, for benzophenone, after bromination, the substituents are ketone (1) and bromine (let's say at position 3). Now, when you nitrate, the incoming nitro group would be directed by both substituents.

The ketone at 1 directs meta, which are positions 3 and 5.

The bromine at 3 directs ortho (positions 2 and 4) and para (position 6).

But wait, the ring already has substituents at 1 and 3, so the nitro can't go to 3. So, the available positions are 2,4,5,6.

Which position is most favored?

The ketone at 1 is a meta director, so nitro would prefer 5.

The bromine at 3 is an ortho/para director, so it would direct to 2 or 4 (ortho) or 6 (para).

But position 5 is meta to ketone, which is a strong director. So, nitro would go to 5.

So, the substituents would be ketone at 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. Which matches the target structure.

So, in option A, the steps are:

i) Acylation → ketone at 1.

ii) Bromination → bromine at 3.

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

Wait, but after adding bromine at 3, can the nitration proceed?

Because the ring now has a ketone (EWG) and a bromine (EWG). Both are deactivating, but nitration is a strong electrophile, perhaps it can still proceed.

So, in option A, the steps are:

1. Acylation (i)

2. Bromination (ii) → adds at 3.

3. Nitration (iii) → adds at 5.

But wait, option A's steps continue beyond that. Steps iv to vii include Fe/HCl, nitration again, diazotization, and H3PO2. So, this would complicate things. But maybe those steps are not needed.

Wait, the target molecule has a ketone, bromine, and nitro. So, perhaps the steps after nitration are not necessary, but looking at the options, each goes through all seven steps.

Wait, but perhaps the steps in the options include all the steps needed, and the correct sequence is the one that leads to the correct substituents.

But in option A, after acylation, bromination, and nitration, the molecule would have the correct substituents. But why are there more steps? Because perhaps the nitration in step iii isn't enough, and another nitration is needed. Or perhaps there's a reduction step.

Alternatively, maybe the nitration in step iii is adding another nitro group, but the target only has one nitro. So, perhaps option A is not the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first introduce the nitro group, then the bromine, then the ketone, but that doesn't seem possible because the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first introduce the nitro and bromine in such a way that allows the ketone to be introduced via Friedel-Crafts.

An alternative idea: introduce the nitro group, then reduce it to an amine, then perform Friedel-Crafts acylation, and then re-introduce the nitro group. But that seems convoluted.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option D.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group added.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → reduction, perhaps to hydroxylamine.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

But I'm not so sure about this sequence. Let me think through it.

Step i: benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine → aniline.

Step iii: NaNO2/HCl → forms diazonium chloride.

Step iv: H3PO2 → some reaction. Wait, H3PO2 is used as a reducing agent in the Stannous condition. But in this context, perhaps the diazonium salt is treated with H3PO2, which would lead to substitution. For example, diazonium salt can be replaced by a hydroxyl group when treated with H2O and H3PO2.

So, step iv would result in a phenol.

Then, step v: Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Phenol is an activating group, so bromination would occur at the para position relative to the hydroxyl group.

Step vi: CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. The ring now has a hydroxyl group (phenol) which is a strong activating group, para to bromine. So, the ketone would add at the meta position relative to the phenol, but wait, the phenol is activating and directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

Wait, after step iv, the ring has a hydroxyl group. Then, step v is bromination, which would add bromine para to the hydroxyl (since phenol is ortho/para director). Then, step vi is Friedel-Crafts acylation, which would add the ketone at the ortho or para position to the hydroxyl group.

But the target has the ketone at 1, and nitro and bromine at 3 and 5. Hmm, this doesn't seem to align.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps after the reduction steps, the ring has an amine group, which is then converted into a hydroxyl group via diazotization and H3PO2. Then, bromination would add bromine in a position directed by the hydroxyl group (ortho or para). Then, Friedel-Crafts would add the ketone in the ortho or para to the hydroxyl group.

But I'm getting stuck trying to fit this into the target structure.

Perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which one leads to the target structure.

Option A: The first three steps are acylation, bromination, nitration. So:

Step i: Benzene → benzophenone (position 1 has ketone).

Step ii: Bromination → adds at position 3 (due to ketone's meta direction).

Step iii: Nitration → adds at position 5 (meta to ketone).

So, after these three steps, the structure matches the target. The remaining steps (iv to vii) are unclear, but perhaps they are additional steps that don't affect the substituents. Alternatively, maybe they are part of a different synthesis route.

But looking at the options, each option has seven steps. So, perhaps the correct sequence is option A, but I'm not sure why the extra steps are included.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is not in the options. But that can't be; I have to choose among the four.

Another approach: the target molecule has three substituents: ketone, nitro, and bromine. So, the steps must introduce all three in the correct positions.

If the correct order is acylation, bromination, nitration, then option A would be the correct one, as its first three steps achieve that.

But let me think, does Friedel-Crafts acylation work after introducing bromine and nitro?

Wait, no. Because after steps i to iii in option A, the ring has a ketone, bromine, and nitro. But further steps (iv onwards) involve Fe/HCl, more nitrations, etc. Which might not be necessary.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is not option A. Because after acylation, bromination, and nitration, the molecule is done. But the option includes more steps, which may not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the target molecule's structure.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the substituents are at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro) relative to the ketone at position 1. So, the nitro is at meta to the ketone, and the bromo is at another meta position.

So, after acylation (ketone at 1), then nitration at 3, then bromination at 5.

So, the steps would be:

i) Acylation → ketone.

ii) Nitration → nitro at 3.

iii) Bromination → bromo at 5.

But looking at the options, none of them have this order. Let's look:

Option A:

i) Acylation → ketone.

ii) Bromination → bromo at 3.

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

So, after these three steps, the substituents are at 1 (ketone), 3 (bromo), 5 (nitro). Which is the target.

Then, what's the purpose of steps iv to vii? Maybe they're not needed, but perhaps in the options, the correct sequence is option A, and the extra steps are a distraction or part of a longer synthesis but not relevant to the final structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps after iii are not affecting the substituents but are part of a protection or other process.

But the question is about the high-yield synthesis, so perhaps the correct sequence is the one that correctly adds the substituents, and the extra steps are distractors.

So, perhaps option A is the correct answer.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has a ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. The substituents must be introduced in an order that allows each step to proceed efficiently, considering the directing effects of the substituents.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**  
   Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1 on the benzene ring.
   
2. **Step ii: Br₂/FeBr₃**  
   Bromination occurs at position 3, which is meta to the ketone group.

3. **Step iii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**  
   Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the ketone group.

At this point, the target structure is achieved: a ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5. The remaining steps (iv to vii) are not necessary for the synthesis of the target molecule and may be extraneous or part of a more complex sequence.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i: Br₂/FeBr₃**  
   Bromination introduces a bromine atom on the benzene ring.

2. **Step ii: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**  
   Nitration introduces a nitro group, which would be directed to the ortho or para position relative to the bromine.

3. **Step iii: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**  
   Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group. However, the ring is already deactivated by the nitro and bromine groups, making this step unlikely to proceed.

Thus, this sequence is not viable.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**  
   Nitration introduces a nitro group on the benzene ring.

2. **Step ii: Fe/HCl**  
   This step likely reduces the nitro group to an amine (-NH₂), which is an activating group.

3. **Step iii: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**  
   Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group. However, the nitro group is a strong deactivator, and its reduction to an amine complicates the sequence. Additionally, the directing effects of the substituents do not align with the target structure.

This sequence is not viable.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i: HNO₃/H₂SO₄**  
   Nitration introduces a nitro group on the benzene ring.

2. **Step ii: Fe/HCl**  
   This step likely reduces the nitro group to an amine (-NH₂).

3. **Step iii: NaNO₂/HCl**  
   Diazotization converts the amine into a diazonium salt.

4. **Step iv: H₃PO₂**  
   This step reduces the diazonium salt, possibly forming a hydroxyl group (-OH).

5. **Step v: Br₂/FeBr₃**  
   Bromination introduces a bromine atom. However, the directing effects of the substituents do not align with the target structure.

6. **Step vi: CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**  
   Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group. However, the ring is already deactivated by the nitro and bromine groups, making this step unlikely to proceed.

This sequence is not viable.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence is **Option A**, as it introduces the ketone, bromine, and nitro groups in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The first three steps (acylation, bromination, and nitration) achieve the target structure efficiently. The additional steps in Option A are unnecessary but do not invalidate the sequence.
