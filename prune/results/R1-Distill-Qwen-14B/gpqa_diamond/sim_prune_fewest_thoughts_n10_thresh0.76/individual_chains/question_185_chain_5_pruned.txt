Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let's see what the question says.

The Hamiltonian is given by H = ε σ · n, where σ is a vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, like the spin of an electron or something like that.

So, the eigenvalues of H are what we're after. Eigenvalues... right. For a matrix, the eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation H|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩. So I need to find E such that H - E I is not invertible, where I is the identity matrix.

But wait, what does σ · n represent? Oh right, σ · n is the dot product. Since σ is a vector of matrices, this would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Each σ component is a 2x2 Pauli matrix. So the operator H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2, and ε is just a scalar.

So H is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix can be found using the trace and determinant. For any 2x2 matrix, the sum of the eigenvalues is the trace, and the product is the determinant.

But wait, alternatively, I remember that the Pauli matrices have some properties that could help. Each Pauli matrix, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, has eigenvalues ±1. But when they're multiplied by something else, maybe the eigenvalues change.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, but when you take σ · n, which is a linear combination of them scaled by n, which is a unit vector. So σ · n would be a matrix whose eigenvalues are ±1. Because any unit vector direction would just rotate the spin, but the magnitude of the eigenvalues shouldn't change. So the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1. Because when you take a spin in any direction, the possible spin projections are ±ħ/2 multiplied by some factor. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The Pauli matrices have eigen
