Okay, so I've got this question here about an algorithm that takes DNA sequences as input and gives numerical outputs. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The examples given are:
AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And the question is, what does ACAGTGACC give? The options are A) 315, B) 185, C)333, D)351.

Hmm. So the first step is to figure out what kind of algorithm is mapping these DNA sequences to numbers. DNA is made up of the bases A, T, C, G, right? So each nucleotide is one of these four letters.

Looking at the first example: AGG is three letters, and the output is 115. Let me see what 115 could represent. Maybe each base is being converted into a number and then summed or something. Let's think about each base's numeric value.

Wait, I remember that sometimes in coding, each character is assigned an ASCII value. Let me check the ASCII codes for these letters.

A is 65, T is 84, C is 67, G is 71. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, in ASCII, uppercase letters are 65 (A) to 90 (Z). So A is 65, G is 71, T is 84, C is 67.

So for AGG: A is 65, G is 71, another G is 71. So adding them up: 65 +71 +71= 207. But the output is 115. Hmm, so that doesn't match. Maybe it's not a simple sum. Or maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe each base is being converted to a single digit. Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let's try that.

AGG would be 1,4,4. Sum is 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115. Doesn't fit. So probably not.

Wait, another idea: perhaps each base is being converted into its position in the DNA base order. DNA is usually ordered as T, C, G, A, but wait, no, I
