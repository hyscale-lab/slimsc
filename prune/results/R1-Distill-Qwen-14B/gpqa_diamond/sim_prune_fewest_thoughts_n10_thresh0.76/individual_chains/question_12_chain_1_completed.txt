Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, let me think. I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and this is a decay process where a positive pion (π⁺) at rest decays into a positive muon (mu⁺) and a neutrino (nu). 

The question gives me the rest masses: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c² and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Neutrinos are almost massless, so I can probably neglect their rest mass. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

Wait, but how do I find the kinetic energy of each particle after the decay? I think I need to use conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. 

In the decay products, the muon has some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino has just kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible). So the total energy after decay should equal the pion's rest energy. 

So the energy equation would be: 
E_pion = E_mu + E_nu
Which translates to:
139.6 MeV = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu

But since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E_nu = K_nu. So the equation becomes:
139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu
Which simplifies to:
K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now, considering momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. 

I recall that the magnitude of momentum p is related to energy E and mass m by the equation:
E² = (pc)² + (mc²)²
Since c is a constant, for relativistic particles, this equation holds. 

Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p. Since the neutrino's momentum is also p (but in the opposite direction), their energies can be expressed in terms of p.

For the muon:
E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units might get confusing. Let me think again. E is in MeV, and masses are in MeV/c². So I think it's better to work with units where c=1, which is common in particle physics.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 )
Similarly, E_nu = p (since m_nu ≈ 0, so E_nu ≈ p).

From the energy conservation equation earlier:
E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV
But E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) and E_nu is p.

So substituting, we get:
sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me let x = p for simplicity. Then:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6

Hmm, solving for x. Let's move x to the other side:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x

Compute the squares:

105.7^2 is approximately (100)^2 is 10,000. 105.7^2 = 11,172.49 MeV².

139.6^2 is about (140)^2 is 19,600, so 139.6^2=19,488.16 MeV².

So plug in the numbers:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x

Rearranging:

279.2 x = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49
279.2 x = 8,315.67

So x = 8,315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let me compute that. Hmm, 8,315 ÷ 280 is approximately 30. So 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.76 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units of x are in MeV/c, because E and p are related via E² = p²c² + m²c^4, but since we set c=1, p is in MeV/c. So x is about 29.76 MeV/c.

Now, E_nu = x = 29.76 MeV. And E_mu = sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.76)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculating each part: 29.76^2 is around 886, and 105.7^2 is 11,172.49. So 886 + 11,172.49 = 12,058.49. Square root of that is sqrt(12,058.49) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but E_mu should be m_mu + K_mu. Because E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. So 109.81 MeV equals 105.7 + K_mu.

So K_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

And E_nu is about 29.76 MeV, which is the kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV for the muon and 29.76 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I got. So the answer should be D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the process:

\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, so its total energy is its rest energy:

\[
E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon (\(\mu^+\)) has a rest mass of \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), while the neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless. The total energy after the decay is distributed between the muon and the neutrino:

\[
E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu,
\]

where \(E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+}\) (rest energy plus kinetic energy of the muon) and \(E_\nu = K_\nu\) (kinetic energy of the neutrino). Substituting:

\[
139.6 = 105.7 + K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
K_{\mu^+} + K_\nu = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Next, conservation of momentum requires that the magnitudes of the muon and neutrino momenta are equal (\(p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu\)) since the pion is initially at rest. The relativistic energy-momentum relation is used for the muon:

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]

and for the neutrino:

\[
E_\nu = p_\nu.
\]

Let \(p = p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu\). Substituting into the energy conservation equation:

\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

Solving for \(p\), let \(x = p\):

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - x.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
x^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2.
\]

Canceling \(x^2\):

\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49,
\]

\[
279.2x = 8315.67,
\]

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.76 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

Thus, the neutrino's kinetic energy is:

\[
K_\nu = E_\nu = p = 29.76 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

For the muon, its total energy is:

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.76^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

Calculating:

\[
29.76^2 = 886, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49,
\]

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12058.49} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The muon's kinetic energy is:

\[
K_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the kinetic energies are approximately:

\[
K_{\mu^+} \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}, \quad K_\nu \approx 29.76 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
