Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution, and I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Right, I remember that dithiocyanato complexes have two SCN- ligands attached. 

The question gives me the concentrations: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. There are also these stability constants, beta1 to beta4. Wait, stability constants are for the complexes, right? So each beta represents the formation constant for the nth complex. 

I think the complexes would form in a stepwise manner. So Co(II) can form Co(SCN)1^+, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. The stability constants beta1 to beta4 are for each step. So beta1 is the constant for the first ligand binding, beta2 for the second, and so on. 

But wait, no. Wait, stability constants are usually for the overall formation. Oh wait, no, the way they're given here, beta1 is for Co(SCN)1^+ (so maybe the first complex), beta2 for Co(SCN)2, etc. Or maybe each beta is the stepwise constant. Hmm, I think for each step, the beta represents the formation of the next complex. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of the betas up to that point. 

Wait, but sometimes stability constants are given as the overall constant for the complex. Let me think. For example, the formation of CoSCN+ would have a stability constant beta1. Then, the formation of Co(SCN)2 would have a stability constant beta2, which is the constant for adding a second SCN- to the first complex. So the overall constant for Co(SCN)2 would be beta1 * beta2. Similarly, for Co(SCN)3, it's beta1 * beta2 * beta3, and for Co(SCN)4, it's beta1 * beta2 * beta3 * beta4. 

Wait, but waitâ€”no, I think the way the stability constants are usually presented is for each step. So, for example,
