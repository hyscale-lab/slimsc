Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The problem says: We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we want to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required. Also, we have to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and can be dissolved by a strong acid. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl (a strong acid) to produce FeCl3 and water. Let me write the balanced equation.

The formula is Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Yeah, that sounds right. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl.

Next, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... let me calculate. Iron has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- is 17 g/mol (16 for O and 1 for H). So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams. So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me do that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is about 0.0009359.

So, according to the balanced equation, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of HCl. So moles of HCl needed = 3 * 0.0009359 ≈ 0.0028077 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M (molarity), which is 0.1 mol/L. So volume (in liters) = moles / concentration = 0.0028077 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028077 L, which is 28.077 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is close. So the volume of acid needed should be approximately 28.05 cm³. But wait, the options also give pH values. So I need to find which option matches both the volume and the pH.

Now, after dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, the solution will have FeCl3. FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte and will dissociate completely. So FeCl3 → Fe³+ + 3Cl⁻. The Fe³+ ions in solution will hydrolyze, making the solution acidic. So we'll have to calculate the pH based on the hydrolysis of Fe³+ ions.

Let me find the concentration of Fe³+ ions. The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), and the moles of Fe³+ are the same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is about 0.0009359 mol. So concentration [Fe³+] = 0.0009359 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009359 M.

The hydrolysis reaction of Fe³+ is: Fe³+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. Wait, no, more accurately, the reaction is Fe³+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)²+ + H+. But considering it's a multi-step process, for simplicity, we can treat it as the formation of H+ ions.

The hydrolysis constant K for Fe³+ is needed. But I don't remember the exact value. I think that for transition metal ions like Fe³+, the hydrolysis constant is large, meaning they are quite acidic. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis can be approximated using the formula pH = (1/2)(pKa + log C), but wait, that's for weak acids. Hmm, maybe it's better to use the formula for a hydrolyzing cation.

Alternatively, another approach: the hydrolysis of
