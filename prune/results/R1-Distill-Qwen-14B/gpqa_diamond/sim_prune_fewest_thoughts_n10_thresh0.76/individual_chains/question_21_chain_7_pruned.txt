Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me write down what I know and think through it.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It's asking about two parts: part A and part B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

Alright, so first, let me recall what tautomerism is. Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to a different structure. The most common example is between keto and enol forms. For a compound to show tautomerism, it must have an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group). If a compound lacks alpha hydrogens, it can't undergo tautomerism.

Looking at the compounds given for part A: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms as substituents. It has two carbonyl groups. Let me think, does benzoquinone have alpha hydrogens? Benzoquinone has the structure O=C6H4=O, right? So the quinone has two ketone groups. The adjacent carbons (the ones attached to oxygen) would be the carbons in the benzene ring. Wait, but wait, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl oxygens are attached to the benzene ring. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of the aromatic ring. But aromatic carbons don't have hydrogens attached to them in a quinone structure. Or do they? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, benzene is C6H6. When it becomes benzoquinone, it loses two hydrogens, right? So it's C6H4O2. The structure is O=C6H4=O, but in reality, benzoquinone has two double bonds: O=C6H4=O. So each oxygen is double-bonded to a carbon on the benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are part of the ring, which are spÂ² hybridized. So in benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (the carbonyl carbons) are the ones next to them in the ring. Do those have hydrogens? Let me think: the benzene ring in benzoquinone has two oxygen atoms attached, each as carbonyl groups. So the structure is like O=C1-C2=C3-C4=C5-C6=C1, where C1 and C4 are each double-bonded to O. So the carbonyl carbons are C1 and C4. The adjacent carbons (like C2, C3, C5, C6) are each connected to one H. So for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. So in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that is part of the ring, which has one H. So the adjacent carbons have H's. Wait, so does benzoquinone have alpha hydrogens? Yes, because each of the carbonyl carbons is attached to a carbon that has H's (the adjacent ring carbons). So can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: tautomerism in quinones. Wait, I think that benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism because it has alpha hydrogens. So maybe it does show tautomerism.

Now the other compound for part A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. This is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So each of these ketones is attached to the ring. So each of the carbonyl groups is connected to a carbon that's part of the ring. Let me imagine the structure. It's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each on alternate carbons. So each ketone is on a carbon that is adjacent to two other carbons. Wait, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups in 1,3,5-trione would each be the next carbons in the ring. So, for example, the carbonyl at C1 is connected to C2 and C6. Are those carbons (C2 and C6) attached to any hydrogens? Well, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is CH2. But in 1,3,5-trione, the ring has three ketone groups. Wait, no, the ring would have three carbonyl groups, so the other three carbons would be CH2? So for each ketone at C1, the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) would be CH2 groups. So each of those CH2 groups has two hydrogens. So yes, those are alpha hydrogens to the carbonyl groups. So, can cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione undergo tautomerism? Or is there a problem?

Wait, wait a second. Tautomerism requires a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl that can shift. So for example, in a diketone, if the adjacent carbons have hydrogens, they can form enols. But in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, it's a symmetric molecule. All three carbonyl groups are equivalent. So, each carbonyl has adjacent CH2 groups. So each of those CH2 groups has hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl.

Wait, but wait. When a compound has multiple ketone groups, especially conjugated, does that affect tautomerism? But I think that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have alpha hydrogens, so it can undergo tautomerism. But wait, another thought: in some cases, when the conjugation is extensive, the compound can't tautomerize because the necessary hydrogen isn't present. Alternatively, maybe in the case of 1,3,5-trione, the molecule is more rigid, perhaps making tautomerism less likely. Or maybe the structure doesn't allow for the keto-enol shift due to symmetry or ring strain.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1,3,5-trione doesn't have alpha hydrogens because the adjacent carbons are all carbony
