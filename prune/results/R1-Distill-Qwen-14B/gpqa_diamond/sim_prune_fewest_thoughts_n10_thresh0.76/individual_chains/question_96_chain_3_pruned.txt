Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole at a distance of d=10^10 parsecs is θ=10^-17 degrees. We need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

I remember that entropy for a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, which is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So, I need to find A first.

The event horizon's radius is given by the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2 G M / c². So, the area A is 4 π R_s².

But wait, I don't know the mass M of the black hole directly. Maybe I can find it using the given angular size θ and the distance d.

Angular size θ is related to the actual size (like the diameter of the event horizon) and the distance. The formula I'm thinking of is θ (in radians) ≈ size / distance. So, θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d. Because the event horizon's radius is R_s, so the diameter is 2 R_s.

But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert it to radians first. Oh right, to convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = θ_deg * π / 180.

Let me plug in the numbers. θ is 10^-17 degrees, so θ_rad = 10^-17 * π / 180 radians. Let me compute that... approximately, 10^-17 * 0.01745 (since π/180 is about 0.01745). So θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, θ_rad ≈ 2 R_s / d. So R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

R_s = (1.745e-19 radians * 1e10 parsecs) / 2.

Wait, but what's a parsec in meters? I remember that
