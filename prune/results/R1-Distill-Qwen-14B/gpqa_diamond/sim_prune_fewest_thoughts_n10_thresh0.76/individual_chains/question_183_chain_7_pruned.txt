Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed in a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is also known as the degree of unsaturation. It's a way to count the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two. So the formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But wait, in this case, the product after reaction, so I need to first figure out what the product looks like.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize this. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are formyl (CHO) at position 2, vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?) Wait, no. Wait, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH-. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 5 on the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, the structure: the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene). So the ring has double bond between C3 and C4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached. So position 5 has a CH₂-CH₂ group? No, wait, position 5 has a vinyl group meaning CH₂=CH- attached to the ring.

Wait, the structure is 2-formyl-5-vinyl. So the cyclohexene ring has a substituent at C2 (CHO) and at C5 (CH₂=CH-). So positions 2 and 5 are opposite each other on the ring? Because in a cyclohex
