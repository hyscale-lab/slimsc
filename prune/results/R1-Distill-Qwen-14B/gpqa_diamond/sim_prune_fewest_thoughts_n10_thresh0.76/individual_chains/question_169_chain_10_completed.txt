Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about nuclear decay. The original decay converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A into two of flavor B, emitting two lighter particles E and V. The equation given is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's stated that the total energy spectrum of E is continuous with some endpoint Q.

Now there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. The question is asking how the energy spectrum of E changes in this scenario.

Hmm. I remember that in particle decays, the type of decay can affect the energy spectrum of the emitted particles. Like in beta decay, the electrons have a continuous spectrum because of the conservation laws—specifically, because the neutrino carries away some energy.

Wait, in the original decay, E has a continuous spectrum. That suggests that E's energy isn't fixed but varies. That makes me think that the decay process must involve some other particles that can take away energy, allowing E's energy to vary.

In the original case, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So there are a lot of particles emitted. The E particles' energy spectrum is continuous, which I think is due to the conservation of energy and momentum. So each E's energy can vary depending on how the other particles share the available energy.

Now, in the variant, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. M is massless, so it's like a photon or a neutrino. So M carries away energy and momentum.

I think the key here is how the number of particles and their properties affect the energy spectrum of E. In the original case, each E's energy can vary because there are multiple particles (like the V's) that can take away some energy. So E's energy isn't fixed.

In the variant, there's only one M. Since M is massless, it's probably moving at the speed of light, and its energy is related to its momentum as E = pc. So M's energy depends on its momentum, which would be determined by the decay dynamics.

Wait, but the decay products are 2E and M. So when the decay happens, the system's energy and momentum have to be conserved. Since M is massless, its energy is entirely from the decay and it's taking away a lot of energy or momentum.

In the original setup, each E has a spectrum because each can share the energy with the V's. But in the variant, since there's only one M, perhaps the energy distribution for E changes. Wait, but we're still emitting two E's. So each E's energy would depend on how the energy is shared between E's and M.

Wait, but in the variant, the decay equation is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So we have two E's and one M.

In the original decay, 2E and 2V. So maybe the presence of more particles (like two V's) allows for a continuous distribution because each can take different amounts of energy.

In the variant, with only one M, perhaps the energy of E's is more constrained. Wait, but the E's are two, so maybe each E can still have a range of energies based on how the energy is shared between them and M.

Wait, but M is massless, so its energy is tied to its momentum. So the total energy released is Q, I think. But when M is emitted, perhaps the energy of E's is determined by the conservation equations.

But wait, in the original case, since there are two V particles, each could carry away different amounts of energy, which allowed the E's to have a continuous distribution. In the variant, with only one M, maybe the E's have less degrees of freedom, so their spectrum might change.

Wait, but the initial statement says that in the original decay, E has a continuous spectrum. So when we change the decay products, how does that affect the E's spectrum.

I remember that when more particles are emitted, you can have a broader range of energies for each. Alternatively, if fewer particles are emitted, it can affect whether the spectrum is continuous or not.

Wait, in the original case, each E must have a continuous spectrum because the V's allow for energy sharing, but in the variant, with M, which is massless, maybe the energy of E's is more determined, leading to a different spectrum.

Alternatively, maybe the E's in the variant still have a continuous spectrum because M can take any amount of energy, so E's can vary.

Wait, but in the original, there are two V particles. So perhaps the presence of multiple particles allows for a more spread out spectrum. If in the variant, it's just M, then maybe E's have their spectrum altered.

Wait, but the problem says that in the variant, they emit one M instead of two V's. So the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

I'm trying to think about how the number of emitted particles affects the energy spectrum. In beta decay, the beta and neutrino have a continuous spectrum because the neutrino can take away varying amounts of energy. So when there's only one other particle, the emitted particle's (like beta) energy is continuous.

In the original decay, maybe each E can have a range of energies because the V's can take varying amounts. So when you have more particles, perhaps each E's spectrum is more continuous.

But in the variant, you have two E's and one M. So how does that affect the E's energy?

Wait, but in the original case, the E's are two, and the V's are two as well. So each E's energy can vary because each V can share the energy. But in the variant, you have M, which is a single massless particle. So perhaps M's emission affects the energy available for the E's.

But the key here is whether the energy spectrum of E becomes continuous or not. Or does it change the endpoint?

Wait, in the original case, the E's have a continuous spectrum up to some maximum Q. So when the decay products change, does the maximum energy (endpoint) of E change?

In the variant, since M is massless, it might take away a significant amount of energy, which could change the maximum energy of E.

Hmm, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

In the original decay, the total energy available is fixed, but because of the conservation laws, the E's can have a range of energies. The endpoint Q is the maximum energy an E can have, when all other particles (the V's) take the minimum possible energy.

In the variant, with M being emitted instead of two V's, perhaps the maximum energy for E increases or decreases. But wait, M is massless, so it's more like a photon which doesn't have rest mass. So when M is emitted, perhaps it can carry away more energy, allowing E's to have higher energies.

Wait, but in the original case, the E's are limited by the available energy. If in the variant, M is emitted, perhaps the maximum energy for E would be the same or different.

Wait, no. Let me think about the available energy. The total energy released in the decay is the same in both cases (assuming same initial and final products except for the emitted particles). So in the original decay, the energy is shared between the E's and the V's. In the variant, it's shared between the E's and M.

So when M is emitted, perhaps the E's can't get as much energy because M is taking some. Or maybe M can take varying amounts of energy, allowing E's to have more energy.

Wait, but M is massless, so its energy is entirely kinetic. So when it's emitted, it takes some of the available energy, which could change the maximum energy available for the E's.

Wait, but the problem states that in the original decay, E's have a continuous spectrum up to Q. So Q is the maximum energy an E can have. But in the variant, perhaps that maximum increases or decreases.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum remains the same because the total energy available is the same. But if the decay products change, perhaps the way energy is allocated changes.

Wait, maybe the presence of another particle (M) affects the possible energy distribution. So in the original decay, with two V's, each V can take a little bit of energy, allowing E's to have a wide range. But in the variant, with only one M, perhaps the E's can't reach as high an energy because M takes more energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the endpoint increases because M can carry away more energy, allowing E's to have higher energies.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

In any decay, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial system (the two A's) has some total energy and momentum. The decay products must sum to that.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V.

In the variant, 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

If M is massless, then its energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light (E = pc). So M's energy is entirely kinetic.

But the number of particles emitted is different. So in the original case, more particles are emitted, which could allow for more degrees of freedom in the energy distribution, leading to a continuous spectrum. But in the variant, with fewer particles, perhaps the E's have a different distribution.

Wait, but the number of E's is the same in both cases—two E's. So the presence of M doesn't change the number of E's. So the question is about whether the E's have a continuous spectrum or not.

In beta decay, when you have beta and a neutrino, the spectrum is continuous because the neutrino can take varying amounts of energy. So each beta's energy can vary, leading to a continuous spectrum.

In the original decay, since there are two V's, perhaps each V can take some energy, allowing the E's to have a continuous distribution. So the E's can have any energy from 0 up to a maximum, depending on how the V's take energy.

In the variant, we have two E's and one M. So perhaps each E's energy is more determined. But wait, no, because M is another particle—so maybe each E's energy can vary based on how much energy M takes.

Wait, but since M is massless, its energy is entirely momentum-based. So in the decay, the sum of the energies of the two E's plus the energy of M must equal the total energy available minus the rest mass energy of the two B's.

Wait, but the exact same reasoning applies as in the original case. So does that mean that the E's still have a continuous spectrum?

Hmm. So perhaps the E's still have a continuous spectrum, just maybe the shape is different. Because now, instead of two V's, there's one M. So the energy partitioning would be different, but the E's can still have varying energies, making the spectrum continuous.

But the question is about whether the spectrum remains continuous or becomes discrete. In the original, it's continuous. So if the variant also allows for a continuous spectrum, then options B or D are possible.

Now, the other part is about the endpoint Q. Does it increase or decrease?

The endpoint is the maximum energy any E can have. In the original decay, the maximum would be when the V's take the minimum possible energy. Since V's have rest mass, perhaps they can't take zero energy. But if the V's are massless, then they could take any amount.

Wait, but in the original decay, the V's are not specified as massless. So they probably have some rest mass. So each V would require some energy for its rest mass plus kinetic energy.

In the variant, the M is massless. So when M is emitted, it can take away a larger amount of energy because it doesn't have a rest mass. So perhaps the maximum energy that an E can have increases because M can take away more energy, allowing the E's to have higher energies.

Wait, no. Think about it: the total energy available in the decay is fixed. Let's say the decay has a certain Q value. In the original decay, each E can have up to Q/2 (if both E's are taking maximum and V's minimum), but if in the variant, M takes more energy, that would leave less for the E's.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. If M is taking more energy, the E's would have less. But if M is massless, it can take away more energy from the system, which would mean that the E's can't have as much as before.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think in terms of the maximum energy an E can have.

In the original decay, the maximum energy for each E occurs when the other particles (V's) take the least possible energy. Since V's have rest mass, the minimum energy per V is their rest mass energy. So if each V has mass m, then each would take at least m*c². So for two V's, that's 2m c².

In the variant, M is massless, so it doesn't have rest mass. The minimum energy M can take is zero? But no, because if M is emitted, it must carry away some momentum. Since M is massless, its energy would be E = pc. So M must have some momentum, which means it takes some energy away.

Wait, but the system's total energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial system (assuming the two A's are at rest) has some energy and zero momentum. The decay products must have total energy equal to the initial energy and total momentum zero.

So in the variant, the products are 2B, 2E, and M.

The two E's would have energies E1 and E2, and M would have energy E_M. The total energy would be E1 + E2 + E_M = Q (the total decay energy, assuming B's are at rest or whatever).

Now, the momentum must also sum to zero. The two E's would have momenta p1 and p2, and M would have momentum p_M. So p1 + p2 + p_M = 0.

But since M is massless, E_M = |p_M| c.

Similarly, for each E, E_i = sqrt( (p_i c)^2 + (m_E c²)^2 ), where m_E is the rest mass of E.

But this is getting complicated. Let me think about the maximum energy for E.

The maximum energy for E would occur when the other particles (the other E, and M) take the least possible energy.

So, for the two E's and M: the maximum energy for one E (say E1) would be when E2 is as small as possible and M takes as little as possible.

But since M is massless, the minimum energy it can take is when it's emitted in the opposite direction of E1, to conserve momentum. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when E1 is at maximum, M is emitted in the opposite direction and with as little energy as possible. But since M is massless, the minimum energy is zero? No, because if M is emitted, it must have some momentum, so E_M can't be zero. So M must have some energy.

Wait, but how does this affect the maximum E1 can have? It's getting a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum energy for an E in the variant is higher than in the original decay. Because in the original, each V has a rest mass, so they can't take zero energy, leaving less energy for E's. Whereas in the variant, M doesn't have a rest mass, so perhaps it can take away more energy, leaving more for E's.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. If M is taking more energy, then less is left for the E's. So E's maximum would be lower in the variant. Or wait, maybe I'm getting it backwards.

Let me think: the total energy available is fixed. So in the original decay, each V has some rest mass. So the minimum energy each V can have is m_V c². So the total minimum energy for V's is 2 m_V c².

Thus, the maximum energy each E can have in the original decay would be (Q - 2 m_V c²) / 2 (assuming the rest mass of B is accounted for). So maximum E would be Q/2 - m_V c².

In the variant decay, M is massless, so its minimum energy is zero, but it can carry away any amount of energy. So the maximum energy for each E would be (Q - E_M) / 2. The maximum occurs when E_M is as small as possible, but since M is massless, E_M can be as small as possible, approaching zero. So E1 can approach Q/2.

So in the variant, the maximum energy of E (endpoint) is higher than in the original decay. Because without the V's' rest mass, the E's can take more energy.

So the endpoint increases.

Now, about the continuity of the spectrum. In the original decay, E's have a continuous spectrum because the V's can take varying amounts of energy, allowing E's to have a range. In the variant, instead of two V's, M is emitted. So the energy distribution for E's is now considering M's energy.

But since M is a single particle, perhaps the energy distribution for E's is still continuous because M can take any possible energy, allowing E's to vary.

Wait, but in the original decay, there are two V's, so each can take some energy. So the E's' energy depends on both V's' energies. In the variant, with only M, the E's' energy depends on M's energy.

In the original, the E's' spectrum is continuous because the V's allow for varying energy sharing. In the variant, the E's' spectrum would also be continuous because M can take any amount of energy, leading to varying E's energies.

So the spectrum remains continuous, but the endpoint increases.

Wait, looking at the options:

Options:

A) Spectrum becomes discrete, endpoint increases.

B) Spectrum remains continuous, endpoint increases.

C) Spectrum becomes discrete, endpoint decreases.

D) Spectrum remains continuous, endpoint decreases.

So according to my reasoning, the spectrum remains continuous and the endpoint increases. So the correct option is B.


The question involves analyzing the energy spectrum of the outgoing particles in two variants of a nuclear decay. In the original decay, the reaction is:

\[
2A \to 2B + 2E + 2V
\]

where the energy spectrum of the emitted particles \(E\) is continuous, with an endpoint \(Q\). In the variant, the decay changes to:

\[
2A \to 2B + 2E + M
\]

where \(M\) is a massless particle. The task is to determine how the energy spectrum of \(E\) changes in the variant compared to the original decay.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Original Decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V):**
   - The energy spectrum of \(E\) is continuous because the two \(V\) particles can take varying amounts of energy, allowing \(E\) to share the remaining energy in a range of values.
   - The endpoint \(Q\) corresponds to the maximum energy an \(E\) particle can have, which occurs when the \(V\) particles take the minimum possible energy (their rest mass energy).

2. **Variant Decay (2A → 2B + 2E + M):**
   - In this case, \(M\) is massless, meaning its energy is entirely kinetic and proportional to its momentum (\(E_M = pc\)).
   - The total energy available for the decay is conserved, but the presence of a single massless particle \(M\) changes how energy is distributed among the decay products.
   - Since \(M\) can take a wide range of energies, the energy spectrum of \(E\) remains continuous. The two \(E\) particles can still share the remaining energy in a range of values, depending on how much energy \(M\) carries away.

3. **Endpoint Comparison:**
   - The endpoint \(Q\) for the \(E\) particles increases in the variant decay. This is because \(M\), being massless, can carry away more energy than the two \(V\) particles in the original decay, leaving more energy available for the \(E\) particles. In the original decay, the \(V\) particles had rest mass energy, which limited the maximum energy available for \(E\). In the variant, this limitation is removed, allowing \(E\) to reach higher energies.

4. **Spectrum Continuity:**
   - The energy spectrum of \(E\) remains continuous in both decays. In the original decay, the continuity arises from the energy sharing between \(E\) and \(V\). In the variant, the continuity arises from the energy sharing between \(E\) and \(M\).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. The spectrum does not become discrete; it remains continuous in both decays.
- **Option B:** Correct. The spectrum remains continuous, and the endpoint increases because \(M\) can carry more energy than the \(V\) particles.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. The spectrum does not become discrete, and the endpoint does not decrease.
- **Option D:** Incorrect. While the spectrum remains continuous, the endpoint increases, not decreases.

### Conclusion:
The energy spectrum of the outgoing \(E\) particles remains continuous in the variant decay, and the endpoint increases due to the massless nature of \(M\), which allows for more energy to be shared with the \(E\) particles.

**Answer: B**
