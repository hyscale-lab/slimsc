Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out. So the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different organic compounds, and I need to pick the right one based on the given spectral data.

First, let's look at the FTIR part. The broad absorption peak at around 3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretching, probably from a carboxylic acid since that's a common compound with such a peak. Carboxylic acids have strong O-H bonds that usually show up as broad peaks in IR because of hydrogen bonding. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes alcohols can also show that, but the other peak at 1700 cm^-1 is a strong absorption. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl group (C=O) which typically absorbs around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits. So the compound is likely a carboxylic acid.

Now the 1H NMR part. The question says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds. So all the structures we're looking at don't have any vinyl groups. That makes sense because all the options are substituted carboxylic acids with branched chains.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, let me write that structure. It's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the chain is like a four-carbon chain, with each middle carbon (positions 2 and 3) attached to a methyl and ethyl group. Wait, actually, how is that structured? Oh, no, wait, each of the middle carbons is connected to a methyl and an ethyl? Or maybe it's a geminal substitution. Let me think. The formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the carbons adjacent to the central CH2 group is attached to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. So each of those middle carbons has two substituents: a methyl and an ethyl group. That would make each of those carbons CH(C2H5)(CH3) groups.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So that's CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the chain is longer: the substituents are on the second and third carbons of a longer chain? Wait, the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the first carbon is CH3CH2-, then the next two carbons each have a methyl and ethyl group attached, and the last is COOH. So the structure is: CH3CH2-C(C2H5)(
