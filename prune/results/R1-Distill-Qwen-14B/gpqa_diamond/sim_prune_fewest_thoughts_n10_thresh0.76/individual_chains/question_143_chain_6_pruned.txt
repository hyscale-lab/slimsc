Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that this reaction involves pinacol, which has two adjacent alcohol groups. Under acidic conditions, one of the OH groups gets protonated. Then, there's a hydride shift that happens, leading to the formation of a ketone called pinacolone. Right, the rearrangement changes the structure by moving the substituents around.

The question gives me two reactions and asks about the starting materials and products. The first reaction is A + H2SO4 → 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. The second is methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate + H2SO4 → B. I need to figure out what A and B are from the options given.

Let's start with the first reaction. The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the structure of this product is a cyclohexanone ring with two p-tolyl groups attached to the 2nd carbon and a ketone at the 1st carbon. Wait, no, actually, the numbering might be different. Wait, cyclohexan-1-one is a six-membered ring with the ketone at position 1. So, positions 2 and 2 have two p-tolyl groups attached. So that's a geminal di-substitution at position 2.

In the Pinacol rearrangement, the starting material (pinacol) would have two adjacent OH groups connected to a cyclohexane ring. When the acid is added, one OH is protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, a hydride (or maybe an alkyl) group shifts from the adjacent carbon to the protonated OH, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which then loses water to form the ketone.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclohexanone. So the starting material (A) must be a diol where the two OHs are on adjacent carbons of a cyclohexane ring. Looking at the product, the two p-tolyl groups are on the same carbon (position
