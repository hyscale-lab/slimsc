Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

The problem talks about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%, and it's part of mixture Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturatedâ€”so probably an alkane.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double bonds, since alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine. But the problem says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X. So, each component of X has at least one double bond or triple bond, but not conjugated. Maybe each has a single double bond or something.

When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y. Disproportionation means that a single species is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, here it's a mixture, so perhaps each component in X is undergoing a reaction. For example, maybe each component is an alkene that's hydrogenating, but in a way that leads to different products. Alternatively, maybe one component is a diene and the other is a mono-ene?

Wait, but the result is a mixture Y which does not decolorize bromine water. So Y's components don't have double bonds. Because if they did, they would still decolorize bromine. So Y must be a mixture of alkanes.

So mixture X must be two alkenes, maybe, each with a single double bond, not conjugated. Because when they undergo hydrogenation, each would become a corresponding alkane.

But wait, X's mixture is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y. But the problem states that Y is formed by a disproportionation, which suggests that each
