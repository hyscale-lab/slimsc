Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in energy given the uncertainty in the electron's position.

Wait, the electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its location Δx is 0.1 nanometers. Oh, right, nanometers are 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. Wait, no, wait, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m? Let me think. Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 1e-9 = 1e-10 m. Got it.

So the problem is about estimating the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE. I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. Since momentum p = mv, maybe I can relate Δp to the uncertainty in velocity or something. Or wait, wait, actually, Δp would be related to the uncertainty in momentum, which could be approximated using the standard deviation of the momentum. But in this problem, perhaps we can consider the minimum uncertainty case, so we'll take Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, the electron has a known speed v.
