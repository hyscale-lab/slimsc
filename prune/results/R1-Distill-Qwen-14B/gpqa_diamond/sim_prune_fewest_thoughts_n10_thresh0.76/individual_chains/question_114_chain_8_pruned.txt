Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O), giving 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B with different reagents.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think this through. Let's break it down into the two steps.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. Adding NaCN and a reagent A. Wait, what's the typical reaction when a ketone reacts with NaCN?

I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. For example, in the presence of a suitable catalyst, like an acid, the carbonyl group (C=O) can react with a nucleophile. So NaCN would act as the nucleophile. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in an acid-catalyzed addition, the ketone would react with CN-.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN would make it (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, no. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have four carbons in the main chain, with a nitrile (CN) group, a hydroxyl (OH) group, and a methyl group all on the second carbon.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)2C=O. When it reacts with CN-, perhaps in a nucleophilic addition, the CN- adds to the carbonyl carbon, and then something happens.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the hydrocyanation reaction. I think that in hydrocyanation of ketones, the addition of HCN to the carbonyl gives a cyanohydrin. The product would be an alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Wait, yeah, the cyanohydrin formation: ketone + HCN in acidic conditions gives a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached.

So the reaction would be: ketone + HCN (or a source of CN-) in presence of acid (like H3O+ or H2SO4) to form the cyanohydrin.

So in this case, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives
