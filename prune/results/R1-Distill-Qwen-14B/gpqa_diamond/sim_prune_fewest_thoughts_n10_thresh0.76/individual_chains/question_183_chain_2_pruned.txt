Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. 

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also called the degree of unsaturation, indicates the number of rings plus double bonds in a molecule. Each double bond or ring adds one to the index.

The reaction involves red phosphorus and excess HI. I think that sounds like the conditions for the Wittig reaction or maybe something else. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus with HI is usually used for the hydrolysis of nitriles? No, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus and HI is used to cleave alkenes. It's a type of reaction called the hydroboration or maybe the hydration of alkenes? No, wait, I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, when you have an alkene and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Red phosphorus is often used in the Staudinger reaction, which involves triphenylphosphine and an azide. Not this case. Alternatively, I remember that HI and red phosphorus can be used in the cleavage of alkenes. Oh right! In the presence of HI and red phosphorus, alkenes undergo a reaction where the double bond is cleaved, and the substituents on either side form new bonds. Specifically, I think it's called the hydroiodic acid cleavage of alkenes.

Wait, the reaction of alkenes with HI (hydroiodic acid) can proceed through two mechanisms: addition or cleavage. But when red phosphorus is present, it's usually for the cleavage. The reaction is called the oxymercuration or maybe the phosphorus-based cleavage. Oh, right, it's the phosphorus pentoxide method, but wait, no. Alternatively, I think when an alkene is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's called the Baeyer-Villiger cleavage? Or maybe that's something else. Alternatively, another approach: the reaction converts alkenes into diols? No, wait, maybe it's the addition of HI followed
