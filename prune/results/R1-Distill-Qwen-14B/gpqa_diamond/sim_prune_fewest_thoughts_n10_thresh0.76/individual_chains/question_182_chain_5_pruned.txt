Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question gives the equation J = (9/8) * epsilon * mu * V² / L³. I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the current in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited conditions. So, this is in the SCLC regime.

Wait, what's the SCLC regime again? Oh right, it's when the current is limited by the build-up of charge in the space charge region, which creates an electric field that counteracts the applied voltage. So the space charge itself affects the current.

The equation given is J proportional to V squared. Oh, right, because in the SCLC, the current density goes as the square of the voltage. So which conditions make this equation valid?

Looking at the options:

Option A says trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate things. Single-carrier implies it's either electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact probably means that the work function is matched, so no injection barriers. Negligible drift current—wait, but if drift is negligible, that's about the current being due to something else, like maybe field emission or something else. Or wait, in SCLC, the dominant current is due to the space charge, so maybe drift is important. Or maybe drift current is considered in the equation, but the option says it's negligible. Hmm, conflicting thoughts.

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier (so Ohmic contact perhaps) and negligible diffusion. Oh, in the derivation of Mott-Gurney, I think it assumes that the dominant transport is drift, not diffusion. So maybe they neglect diffusion current. Because in SCLC, the current is mainly due to the space charge, which leads to an electric field that causes the carriers to drift. So if diffusion is the main thing, maybe that's a different regime. So B might be a possibility.

Option C: single-carrier with Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. Schottky contact implies a barrier for carriers. Oh, but if there's a Schottky barrier, that would affect the injection of carriers. In Mott-Gurney's equation, I think the device is supposed to have no injection barriers, meaning it's in Ohmic contact. Because if there's a barrier, then the current would depend on that as well, perhaps making the equation not applicable. So C might not be correct.

Option D: two-carrier device, Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion. Two-carrier would complicate things because the equation assumes a single carrier type. So D is probably wrong.

So key points: the equation is for a single-carrier, trap-free, with no injection barriers (so Ohmic contact). Also, it assumes that diffusion is negligible because in SCLC, the drift current dominates. So looking at the options:

Option B says no injection barrier (so Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion. So yes, that fits. Option A says negligible drift current, which I'm not sure about. Because SCLC is about drift current being dominant, I think. Oh wait, no—wait, if drift is dominant, then drift is not negligible. So if the option says negligible drift, that would be incorrect. So option A says negligible drift current. That would be opposite of what Mott-Gurney requires. So A is incorrect because it says negligible drift.

So the correct option must be B. Because B says no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion. Because in Mott-Gurney, the current is dominated by drift, so diffusion is considered negligible. Wait, but I thought the derivation of Mott-Gurney considers the space charge and the resulting electric field, but if diffusion is present, perhaps the equation changes.

Alternatively, maybe in Mott-Gurney, we assume that the current is due to drift only, and diffusion is negligible. So Option B is the correct
