Okay, so I have this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

Mike designed a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to remove as many gas molecules as possible to improve imaging because fewer gas particles mean less electron scattering. But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there, as the mass spec detected.

He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, λ1, based on things like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure.

Now, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, even though the temperature is the same. So why would the mean free path change if temperature is constant?

Wait, I think the mean free path depends on factors like pressure and the number of particles. Oh, but the system is under ultra-high vacuum, so pressure is already really low. But when the electron beam is on, maybe there's some effect happening that changes the effective pressure or something else.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam is high-energy. Maybe the electrons are interacting with the gas molecules. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize or even dislodge them, right? If the gas is ionized, they might behave differently. Like, charged particles might stick to the walls more, or perhaps the effective cross-section for scattering changes.

Mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure and the number density of molecules. If ionization occurs, the number of neutral gas molecules would decrease because some are ionized and maybe pumped away or stuck to surfaces. So the effective pressure might be lower. Lower pressure would imply a longer mean free path because λ is proportional to 1/P. So if P decreases, λ increases.

Wait, but wait, the mean free path equation I remember is λ = 1/(n * σ * sqrt(2)), where n is number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So if n decreases, λ increases. But if the electrons
