Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question says that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, and the coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l1 and l2 are both 1, which makes sense because p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Hmm, right. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum L1 and L2. Since they're in p orbitals, each has l=1, so L1z can have eigenvalues mħ where m is -1, 0, +1. Same for L2z.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, what does that state represent? I remember that when you couple angular momenta, you combine l1 and l2 to get total L. The state is a product of the individual states coupled together.

But wait, in this case, are we talking about a coupled state or a product state? Because the state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which I think is part of the coupled basis. So this is an eigenstate of the total angular momentum squared (L²) and its z-component (Lz).

So for the coupled state, the total Lz is mħ, which here is -ħ. So the total Lz is -ħ.

But we're asked about the individual L1z and L2z. So we need to find the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both are -ħ each.

Wait a minute, each electron's L1z and L2z can each be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. But the total Lz is the sum of the individual m's times ħ. So in this case, the total m is -1. So Lz = L1z + L2z = (m1 + m2) ħ.
