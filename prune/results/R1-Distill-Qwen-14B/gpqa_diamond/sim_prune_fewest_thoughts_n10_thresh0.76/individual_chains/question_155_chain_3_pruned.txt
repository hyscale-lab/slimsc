Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the variance. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

Wait, but the state is given in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, so the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That should make things easier because in that case, the expectation values are just the eigenvalues multiplied by probabilities.

Wait, no, wait. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me double-check. The basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, so each component of the state corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z.

So, the state vector is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. Each component is the amplitude for each eigenstate.

So, the eigenstates of P_z are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |-z⟩. Let's say the state is |ψ⟩ = a|+z⟩ + b|0z⟩ + c|−z⟩. Then a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

Wait, but let's look at the matrix forms of P_x, P_y, and P_z. The operator P_z has a diagonal matrix with entries [ħ, 0, -ħ]. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the three basis states.

So, the state vector is ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 )^T. Each component corresponds to the coefficient of each eigenstate of P_z.

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, since the state is a linear combination, the expectation value is the sum of the coefficients squared multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Wait, no. Because expectation value is the sum of |a|^2 * (e
