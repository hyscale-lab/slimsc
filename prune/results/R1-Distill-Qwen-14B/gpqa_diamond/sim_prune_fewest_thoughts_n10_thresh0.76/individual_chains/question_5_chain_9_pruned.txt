Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is broken down into its X, Y, and Z components, each given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the full operator would be P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices. But wait, looking at the given components:

P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Or wait, actually, the standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so P_y is (ħ/2) times that. And P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], which is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P here seems to be a spin operator, perhaps for a spin-½ particle like a muon. Because for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, etc.

Wait, the question says the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, I see—the operator is for the component of P along this direction n. So the operator we're considering is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But the question is about the eigenvector of this operator P along the direction n. So the operator is P_n, and we're looking for its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Wait, but the problem states that the eigenvalue is +ħ/
