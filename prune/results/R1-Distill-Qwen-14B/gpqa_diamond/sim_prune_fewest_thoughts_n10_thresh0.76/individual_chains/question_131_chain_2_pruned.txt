Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. It's dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The key clue is the NOESY spectra: major has a cross-peak, minor doesn't (or it's weak). And the question is about which resonances are connected in the major product.

First, I need to figure out what the starting anhydride looks like. The dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, when dehydrated, forms an anhydride. Let's think about that. Dicarboxylic acids dehydrating to anhydrides usually lose water between the two carboxylic groups. Now, if there's a cis-alkene in the dicarboxylic acid, that would influence the structure of the anhydride. Wait, but when dehydrating, the alkene might not be directly part of the anhydride. Oh, wait no—the dehydration is forming the anhydride, so perhaps the alkene is in the molecule elsewhere?

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid where the two carboxylic groups are on either side of a double bond. So the structure would be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond. No, wait, the cis-alkene would be between the two carboxylic groups. So perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but between the two CH2 groups is a double bond. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond in the middle? No, wait, that would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's without a double bond. Hmm, maybe the acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond between the two CH groups attached to the COOH groups. And since it's cis, the two CHs are on the same side.

When this is dehydrated to form an anhydride, the two carboxylic acid groups lose a water molecule and form an anhydride ring. The structure of the anhydride would have the double bond adjacent to the oxygen atoms of the anhydride. So the anhy
