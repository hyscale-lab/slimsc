Okay, let's try to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states with definite values.

Wait, the operator is given as vector P, so that probably means it's a vector operator, like momentum or something similar. The direction is along n in the x-z plane, which means n has components (nx, 0, nz), right? So any direction in the x-z plane, not y.

The components of the operator P are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Each of these matrices must be the Pauli matrices. Let me think: Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], which matches Px. Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], which matches Py. Pauli Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], matching Pz. So the operator components are indeed the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Since the operator P is a vector operator, the operator along direction n is given by the dot product of P with n. So, P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Wait, but n lies in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the operator we're considering is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), and we need to find its eigenvector with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Let me write this operator out. Each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix, so:

n_x (ħ/2) σx + n_z (ħ/2) σz.

So that's (ħ/2) (n_x σx + n_z σz). Let me write it as (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix:

n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which becomes:

[[n_z*(ħ/2), n_x*(ħ/2)],
 [n_x*(ħ/2), -n_z*(ħ/2)]]

Wait, no. Wait, no, because I think I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, each term is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So, P · n is (n_x)(ħ/2) σx + (n_z)(ħ/2) σz. So the operator is:

(ħ/2) [ n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So the matrix is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix is [[ (ħ/2) n_z , (ħ/2) n_x ], [ (ħ/2) n_x, -(ħ/2) n_z ] ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +
