Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Okay, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas. I remember that each of these techniques gives different kinds of information, so I'll have to piece together the clues from each.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The problem states there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I think that broad peak usually corresponds to O-H stretching. So this compound likely has an -OH group, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or something similar. But wait, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's a strong hydrogen bond, like in a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet. 

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I remember that carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) show strong peaks around 1700 cm⁻¹. The peak at 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like C=C in a ring), or maybe an amide or something else. Wait, but in this case, I think the 1700 is a carbonyl. So maybe there's an ester group, because esters have two carbonyl peaks? Or perhaps a ketone and another carbonyl-containing group. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Hmm.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including ones for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have some double bonds. So maybe an alkene is present, which would explain the vinyl H's in the NMR. 

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what that could be. Common fragments at m/z 45 include maybe (CH2)2O, but wait, let me think. The molecular weight of 45 could be something like C3H7O, but that depends on the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene ion or something else. Alternatively, could it be a methyl ester group losing something? Wait, I think the [CH3O] would be 31, but 45 is higher. Alternatively, I remember that the fragment at 45 might correspond to (CH2)2O, which is 31, that's not right. Wait, another thought: the molecular ion for formaldehyde is 30, but that's not 45. Wait, maybe it's a fragment from an ester or a ketone. Let me think: perhaps a fragment like (CH3CO) which would be 58, no. Alternatively, maybe (CH2)2O with something else attached? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should move on and see if other clues can help
