Okay, so I have this physics problem about gamma rays and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about when the lifetime of high-energy gamma rays is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons. The reaction given is gamma + gamma → electron + positron. I remember that this process is significant because it can limit how long these high-energy photons can exist in the universe. The process is probably a way for the gamma rays to lose energy or even annihilate, reducing their number over time.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's a very low energy, which makes sense because the CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang and has a peak in the microwave region. So, the CMB photons are low-energy.

I think this has to do with the cross-section for the gamma-gamma annihilation process. The cross-section would determine the probability of this interaction happening. The formula for the cross-section probably depends on the energies of the gamma and CMB photons involved.

Wait, in gamma-gamma collisions, the energy of each photon matters. The threshold energy for producing an electron-positron pair is when the combined energy is just enough to create the rest mass of the particles. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so the positron has the same. So each pair requires at least 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV total energy. But wait, actually, in the center-of-mass frame, the minimum energy to produce the pair is twice the electron mass. So each gamma should have enough energy when combined with another photon.

Wait, but in this case, the CMB photon is the other photon. So the high-energy gamma (let's call it E_gamma) collides with a low-energy CMB photon (E_photon ≈ 1e-3 eV). The reaction gamma + photon → e+ e-.

I think the cross-section for this process depends on the product of the two photons' energies. Or maybe it's more about the center-of-mass energy. Let me recall the formula for the cross-section. Oh right, the cross-section for pair production via the CMB is often given by something like sigma ~ (E^2) / (m_e^4
