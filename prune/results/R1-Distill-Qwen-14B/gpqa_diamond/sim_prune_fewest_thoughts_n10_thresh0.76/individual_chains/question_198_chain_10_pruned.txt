Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants are involved in determining which complex is more stable. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

So, the given data is: total cobalt concentration c(Co) is 1e-2 M, which is 0.01 M. The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, but typically stability constants increase with the number of ligands attached. Oh wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β3 of 63. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the complexes have different structures or something else.

The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which would have two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion. So I'm looking for the fraction of Co that's in the form with two SCN- attached.

Stability constants are for the formation of the complexes. So the general approach would be to write the formation reactions for each complex and use the stability constants to find the distribution of each species.

The total cobalt species are Co^2+ (free ion), [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+}, I think. Or wait, maybe the charges are different. Let me think: each SCN- is -1. So for Co^2+:

- [Co]^2+ (the free ion)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ : Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ → charge is +1 (2+ -1 +1? Wait, no, more accurately, the complex [Co(SCN)]^+ would have a charge of +1 because Co is +2 and one SCN- (-1), so 2+ -1 = +1.

Wait, no, the complex [Co(SCN)]^+ would have a formula of Co(SCN)^(+). Since Co is +2, and SCN- is -1, the complex would have a charge of +1 (because 2+ -1 = +1). Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would have Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → charge is 2+ -2 = 0? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, each SCN is a -1 ligand. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}, the charge would be Co charge minus n*(SCN charge). So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{m+}, m = 2 - n*1. So:

n=0 → Co^2+ → m=2+.
n=1 → Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ → m=1+.
n=2 → [Co(SCN)_2] → m=0? Wait,
