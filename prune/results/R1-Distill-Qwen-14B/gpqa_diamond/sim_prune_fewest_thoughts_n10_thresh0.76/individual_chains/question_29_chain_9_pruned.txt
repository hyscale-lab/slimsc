Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some mutations. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. That's bad because it makes the barley unusable for food. They found the gene responsible for making this compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. Now, they're using EMS mutagenesis to create mutants. After sequencing, they found changes in the first exon area. The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The options are Mutant 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each has a different change in the DNA sequence. I think I need to look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene to see which one causes a change that would disrupt the compound's synthesis.

Looking at the intact gene sequence: It starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA. The reading frame is important because mutations can cause frame shifts or amino acid changes.

Let's examine each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the first part, original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT.
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT. Let's see the difference. Comparing each nucleotide:

Original: positions 1-20 (approximate)
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...

Mutant 1:
ATG TCT ACG C (wait, maybe to line them up better.)

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the sequences aligned.

Intact: ATG TTTCT CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAAC...
Mutant 1: ATG TCTAC GCT GGT ACT TCTGTGGATGAAC...

Wait, perhaps a substitution. Let me count the differences.

Original first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant 1:
ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA... Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write each position.

Original: positions 1-20: 
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
A   T   G   T   T   T   C   T   C   G   C   T   G   G   T   A   C   T   T   C

Mutant 1:
A   T   G   T   C   T   A   C   G   C   T   G   G   T   A   C   T   T   C   G

Wait, maybe each line is 20 bases? Not sure, but looking at where the changes are.

Wait, the original starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Comparing:

Original: positions 4-8 are TTTCT, and in mutant 1, it's TCTAC. So, maybe positions 4 and 5: original had TT, mutant has CT. Wait, let's see:

Original: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, perhaps there's a substitution in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the change is from T to C or something. Let me look for where the sequences diverge. Let
