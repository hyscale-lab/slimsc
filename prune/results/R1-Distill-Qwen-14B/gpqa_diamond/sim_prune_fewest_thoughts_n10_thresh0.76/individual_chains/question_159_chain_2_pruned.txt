Okay, I need to figure out the comoving distance of this quasar based on the given options. Hmm, the question mentions a peak in the near infrared and optical spectrum at around 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. I remember that in quasars, the emission lines are broad, but how does that relate to the distance?

Wait, the peak at 790 nm—could that be related to redshift? Oh right! If the peak is in the near infrared, that might indicate that the rest wavelength is in the optical. Like, if the quasar emitted light that's now redshifted into the infrared. Let me think about the Lyman-alpha line. Oh, wait, Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm. I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer break? The Balmer break occurs around 400 nm in the rest frame. If we see it at 790 nm, that would imply a redshift of about 1.975, because 400*(1+z) = 790 → z ≈ (790/400) - 1 = 1.975. So z is approximately 2.

But wait, maybe I should calculate the exact value. Let's see: 400*(1 + z) = 790 → 1+z=790/400=1.975 → z=0.975? Wait, no. Wait, 790 is longer than 400 nm, so if the observed wavelength is longer, the source must be redshifted. So the rest wavelength is shorter. So the Balmer break is at 400 nm in the source frame, but observed at 790. So 400 * (1+z) = 790 → (1+z) = 1.975 → z=0.975. Wait, that gives z=0.975, which is about 1. So maybe I should double-check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from the Lyman break. Lyman break occurs around 91 nm. So if observed at 790 nm, the rest frame would be 91 nm. 91*(1+z)=790 → 1+z=790/91≈8.68 → z≈7.68. That's a much higher redshift. But wait, that seems really high. I'm not sure which break it is. The question says it's the near infrared and optical. So the peak is at 790, which is near infrared. The drop is at shorter wavelengths. So perhaps the Balmer break, which is a drop from optical to infrared. Because the Balmer series transitions in hydrogen occur in the optical, and the Balmer break is when the ionizing photons are absorbed, moving the emitted light into longer wavelengths (redshifted). So the break itself is where the continuum drops because of absorption by neutral hydrogen. So if the rest frame Balmer break is at 400 nm, observed at 790, then z is (790/400)-1= 0.975. So z≈1
