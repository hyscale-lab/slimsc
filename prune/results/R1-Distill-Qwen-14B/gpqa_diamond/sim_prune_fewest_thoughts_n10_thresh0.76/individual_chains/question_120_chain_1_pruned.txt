Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's see if I can work this out.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws of 1/plx.

Hmm, okay. Parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance. Or wait, is it distance = 1/plx? Yeah, that's right. So a higher parallax means the star is closer.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's think about the distribution. The stars are uniformly distributed in space, which probably means that their number density is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume of space doesn't depend on where you are, just the volume.

Parallax relates to distance, so the number of stars we observe within a certain distance range depends on the volume. Let me break it down. Suppose I'm considering a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd). But wait, since we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/d, I need to express this in terms of plx.

Let me let plx = p, so p = 1/d. Then, d = 1/p. The shell's thickness in distance is dd, so in terms of p, that would be a change in p, dp. How? Because d = 1/p. So dd would be the derivative of d with respect to p times dp. Let's compute that: dd = d(p) = derivative of (1/p) with respect to p is -1/p². So, dd = (-1/p²) * dp. But since we're dealing with absolute values, it's positive, so dd = (1/p²) dp.

Wait, but the volume element in terms of p is dV = 4π d² * dd. Substituting d = 1/p, d squared is 1/p². So dV = 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) )= 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, since the number of stars in a volume is N = n * dV, where n is the number density (number per unit volume). Because the distribution is uniform, n is a constant. So the number of stars in the shell is N = n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, the number per unit p is N/(dp) = n * 4π (1/p^4) ). So, as p increases (i.e., as stars are farther away), the number per unit p decreases as 1/p^4.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx range (like per 1 arcsecond)
