Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1, which I remember is usually indicative of O-H stretching. Broad peaks in that region are typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids, but I'm not sure yet.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Wait, 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group. Like, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, but I'm not certain what that could be. Maybe a conjugated carbonyl or an amide? Or possibly an aromatic ring with some substitution.

Looking at the NMR spectrum, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe an alkene group.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I need to think about what fragments give that mass. 45 could be a fragment with (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 2 carbons in CH3 groups, each with 3 hydrogens: 2*(12+3) ) plus the oxygen. Wait, (CH3)2O is 2*(15) + 16 = 46? No, wait, that's 15*2=30 plus 16 is 46. So that's m/z 46. Hmm, maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility. The fragment at 45 could be an ethyl group attached to something else. Or maybe a group like CH2CH2O? No, not sure. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of a methyl group plus something. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7 (since 3*12 +7= 43) plus 2 for something else? Or perhaps it's the molecular ion of a smaller fragment.

Wait, another angle: The molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So I have to figure out which one fits the data.

Let's go through each piece of evidence.

First, the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests OH groups. So the compound might have an alcohol group. But wait, carboxylic acids also have broad O-H stretches, but I think they're usually even broader. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which has an O-H in the IR? No, wait. Esters don't have free OH groups; they have an OR group. So if it's an ester, the O-H peak would be from somewhere else, like from an alcohol in the starting material, but maybe not the
