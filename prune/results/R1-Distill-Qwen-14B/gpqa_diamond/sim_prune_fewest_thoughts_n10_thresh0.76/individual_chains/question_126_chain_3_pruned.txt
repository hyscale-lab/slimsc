Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question involves two reactions, I and II. Then, the products from both are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks the chemist will observe in each case.

Alright, let's start with Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Then it's treated with LAH, which is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on carbon 3 and a methoxy group on carbon 5. So, the molecule is (S) configuration at carbon 5, but wait, noâ€”the configuration is at the methoxy group. Wait, no, the S configuration is at the chiral center where the methoxy is attached, which is carbon 5.

So when we reduce the ketone at position 3, the product will be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait: hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2... Let me draw it.

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one:

The carbon chain is six carbons long. Carbon 3 is a ketone (O=C-). Carbon 5 has a methoxy group (OCH3) attached. The configuration is S at carbon 5. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, wait, no. Let's number from the other end perhaps. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO something. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO- but wait, hexane has six carbons. So the structure is:

CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's better to think as:

Positions 1 to 6:
