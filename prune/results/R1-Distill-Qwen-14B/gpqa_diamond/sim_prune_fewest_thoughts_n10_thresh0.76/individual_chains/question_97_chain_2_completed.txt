Okay, so I've got this question about Klinefelter's syndrome and why its phenotypic consequences are less severe compared to Down's syndrome. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that Klinefelter's is a sex chromosome disorder. It occurs when a boy has an extra X chromosome, so his karyotype is XXY instead of the usual XY. On the other hand, Down's syndrome is caused by trisomy 21, where there's an extra copy of chromosome 21.

The question is asking about the molecular mechanism that leads to Klinefelter's having less severe symptoms. I think it's something to do with how the chromosomes are handled during meiosis.

Wait, Klinefelter's is due to an extra X, but since males usually have two sex chromosomes, maybe the extra X doesn't cause as many issues because it's not as active. Oh! I remember something about X-inactivation. In females (XX), one X is inactivated to balance gene expression. Since males usually have only one X, but in Klinefelter's, they have two X's and one Y, perhaps the extra X gets inactivated, similar to how it's done in females.

So, in the case of Klinefelter's, the body inactivates one of the X chromosomes. This would mean that the extra X isn't actively contributing extra genes. In contrast, Down's syndrome involves an extra chromosome 21 that isn't inactivated, leading to overexpression of all the genes on that chromosome.

Let me think about the options. The question is about the molecular mechanism causing less severe symptoms in Klinefelter's. So, the correct answer would relate to X-inactivation.

Looking at the options:

A) Chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote. Hmm, methylation is an epigenetic process. X-inactivation does involve methylation, particularly of the XIST gene which triggers inactivation. So this could be relevant.

B) Progression of polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst. Not sure. Polymerase alpha is involved in DNA replication, maybe during cell division. Not directly related to X-inactivation.

C) Attachment of spindle to kinetochores in metaphase I. That sounds like a process in meiosis where chromosomes are aligned. If this process goes wrong, it could lead to nondisjunction, but how does that relate to the severity of symptoms? Maybe not directly.

D) Chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis. Chiasmata are where crossing over happens during meiosis. Separase helps in cutting the cohesin proteins that hold sister chromatids together. If resolution is incorrect, chromosomes don't separate properly. Again, not directly about gene expression.

So, option A is about methylation, which is part of X-inactivation. If the extra X is inactivated, the extra genes aren't expressed, leading to less severe symptoms. So Klinefelter's is less severe because the extra X is silenced. In Down's, chromosome 21 isn't inactivated, so all the extra genes are expressed.

So the mechanism for less severe symptoms in Klinefelter's is the X-inactivation, which involves chromatin methylation, which is option A.


Klinefelter's syndrome results from an extra X chromosome (karyotype XXY) in males, while Down's syndrome is caused by trisomy 21. The phenotypic consequences of Klinefelter's syndrome are less severe compared to Down's syndrome due to the molecular mechanism of X-inactivation. In females (XX), one X chromosome is inactivated to balance gene dosage, and this process involves chromatin methylation, particularly through the XIST gene. In males with Klinefelter's syndrome, one of the two X chromosomes is also inactivated, silencing the extra X and reducing the expression of its genes. This inactivation mitigates the effects of the additional X chromosome. In contrast, Down's syndrome involves an extra chromosome 21 that is not inactivated, leading to overexpression of all its genes and more severe phenotypic consequences.

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** Chromatin methylation by histone methyltransferases in the post-zygote is directly related to X-inactivation, which explains the reduced severity of Klinefelter's syndrome.
- **B)** Progression of polymerase alpha in the morula/blastocyst is unrelated to X-inactivation or the severity of chromosomal disorders.
- **C)** Attachment of spindle to kinetochores in metaphase I is a general meiotic process and does not specifically explain the reduced severity of Klinefelter's syndrome.
- **D)** Chiasmata resolution by separase in diakinesis pertains to chromosome segregation during meiosis but does not address the molecular mechanism of reduced severity in Klinefelter's syndrome.

The correct answer is **A**, as chromatin methylation is central to the X-inactivation mechanism that reduces the phenotypic impact of Klinefelter's syndrome.

Answer: A
