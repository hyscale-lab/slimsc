Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The substances given are all substituted benzene rings, and we're supposed to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. My goal is to determine the correct order.

First, I should remember what factors influence the regioselectivity in electrophilic substitution reactions. I recall that activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) are activating and ortho/para directors, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) are deactivating and meta directors. The position where the substitution occurs depends on the directing effects of the substituents.

The problem states that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. So each will substitute once, but the position (ortho, meta, para) depends on the substituent's directing effect.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So I need to figure out the major product for each compound, specifically how much of the product is the para-substituted version.

Let me list the substituents for each substance:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The substituent is a methyl group (-CH3), which is an EDG. So it's an activating, ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: This is ethyl benzoate. The substituent is a carbonyloxyethyl group (-COOEt). The carbonyl is an EWG, so this is a deactivating group. The ester group is an EWG, making the ring less reactive. Since it's an EWG, it's a meta director.

Wait, but wait. For substituents like -COOR, the directing effect depends on resonance. The carbonyl oxygen can delocalize electrons through resonance, which makes the ring deactivating, but how does that affect the direction? I think esters are meta directors because they are EWGs. So substituent directs to meta.

3) C6H5-Cl: This is chlorobenzene. Cl is an EWG, but wait, chlorine is unique. It's an EWG due to its electronegativity, but it's also ortho/para director because of its lone pairs. So Cl is a strong deactivating but ortho/para directing group. So substitution occurs mainly at ortho and para positions.

4) C6H5-NO2: This is nitrobenzene. The nitro group (-NO2) is a strong EWG, so it's meta directing. So substitution occurs at meta positions.

Wait, wait. Wait, nitro groups are meta directors, correct. They withdraw electrons through resonance and inductive effects, making the ring deactivating, and they direct to meta.

5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. The substituent is an ethyl group (-C2H5),
