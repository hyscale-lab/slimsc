Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me think. Alright, so the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll try to visualize it.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Now, inside this cavity, someone placed a small positive charge +q. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, right? So, L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P, and l is the distance from the center of the cavity to P. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute themselves. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when you put a charge inside the cavity, what happens? Oh right, the conductor being neutral means that any induced charges must balance this. Let me think.

Inside the cavity, the +q charge induces charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have -q charge. Because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance the -q on the inner surface. Wait, no, wait: the conductor's total charge is zero, so if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q because the total conductor charge is inner + outer = 0. Oh, wait no. The conductor was initially neutral. So when you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q because the total charge of the conductor is zero. So, the conductor's outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So, from the outside, looking at point P, which is outside the conductor,
