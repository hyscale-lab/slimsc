Okay, so I have this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are common in many quantum states like coherent or squeezed states.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant. And N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Wait, let me see. So N squared is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²). That makes sense because when you take the inner product of |psi> with itself, the cross terms come into play.

The non-Gaussianity is calculated using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state, and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state. So basically, del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is often computed with respect to a Gaussian state, like a coherent state. Because Gaussian states are easier to handle, and they form a good reference for measuring how non-Gaussian another state is.

The question gives phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Let me plug these values in.

First, let's compute N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

Phi is -pi/4, so 2 phi is -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1.

So the term inside N becomes 1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2 ). Let's compute exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N squared is 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So the state |psi> is normalized as (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ) / 0.627.

Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> ≈ (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071|−0.5> ) / 0.627.

Hmm, but wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. So rho is the density matrix of this superposition of two coherent states.

I think that the non-Gaussianity measure here is comparing this state to a Gaussian one. But wait, coherent states are Gaussian. So perhaps the reference Gaussian state, tau, is the completely mixed state? Or maybe it's the state that is the average of the two coherent states.

Wait, no. The reference Gaussian state probably is the state that this non-Gaussian state would reduce to if it were Gaussian. Alternatively, maybe they take the reference as the closest Gaussian state to the given non-Gaussian rho. But I'm not entirely certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is a coherent state. But wait, the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, so its density matrix isn't Gaussian. So tau would be the Gaussian state that best approximates rho in some sense.

Wait, the question says that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps the reference is a specific Gaussian state, like the state that rho would be if it were Gaussian. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the reference is a maximally mixed
