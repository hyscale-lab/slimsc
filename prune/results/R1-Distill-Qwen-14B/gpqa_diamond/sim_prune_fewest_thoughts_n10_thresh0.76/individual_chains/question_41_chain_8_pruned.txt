Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the speed of light in glass from the perspective of an observer in a lab. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. And I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. Oh, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially in different media, things get a bit tricky. The glass is moving, so I guess it's about how the light's speed is perceived when the medium itself is moving.

Wait, in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, right? But here we're dealing with glass, which has a refractive index n. So the speed of light inside the glass is normally c/n, which is 1/n since c is 1.

But wait, the glass is moving. How does that affect the observed speed? I think I should consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity, but wait, is that applicable here? Because the glass is moving at a velocity v, which is presumably much less than the speed of light, so maybe I can use a non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Doppler effect problem? Or maybe it's about how the velocity of the medium affects the observed velocity of the light. 

Wait, another approach: the observer is in the lab, and the glass is
