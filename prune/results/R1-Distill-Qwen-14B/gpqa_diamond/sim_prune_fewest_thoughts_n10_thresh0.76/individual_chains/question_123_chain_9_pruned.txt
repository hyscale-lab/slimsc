Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The problem says that the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. Wait, inertial frames mean they're moving at constant velocity relative to each other, right? No acceleration involved. So it's a problem involving relative velocity, probably using special relativity since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

The key data points: the ejecta part is moving towards the Galactic center. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So that's the relative speed between them. Wait, wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed is 60,000 km/s. Wait, but relative speeds in different frames are tricky. Oh, right, because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. But wait, maybe the problem is expecting a classical approach since it's a supernova ejecta, which might not be relativistic? Or maybe not. Wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let's convert that to meters per second for easier calculations. 6e4 km/s is 6e7 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2c. Because 60,000 km is 6e4 * 1e3 m = 6e7 m. Divided by 1 second, yeah. So 6e7 m/s is 0.2 times the speed of light (since 3e8 m/s is c). So it's 20% the speed of light. That's significant; relativistic effects might be noticeable, but perhaps the problem is assuming a non-relativistic approach, or maybe it's using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So, time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So we need to find the distance from the ejecta's perspective in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but wait. The Galaxy and the ejecta are moving relative to each other. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity, say, v. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. Because in inertial frames, the relative velocity is symmetric in that sense.

Wait, but in reality, when two objects are moving towards each other, each sees the other approaching at the same speed. So if in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at v towards the ejecta. So the given speed is 60
