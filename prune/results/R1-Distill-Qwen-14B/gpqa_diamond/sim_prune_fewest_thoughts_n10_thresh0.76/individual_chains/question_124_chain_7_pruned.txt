Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly but move at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking: what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm, so I think this has to do with the particles' speed and how far they can travel before decaying. Because if they're moving at a certain speed, they might not live long enough to reach the detector's walls. The problem probably involves the concept of time dilation from special relativity.

Wait, I remember that the proper time (the time experienced by the moving particle) is shorter than the coordinate time (the time observed from the lab frame). So, particles with a higher Lorentz factor (gamma) would have a longer lifetime from the lab's perspective, allowing them to travel farther before decaying.

But wait, in this scenario, the particles are moving in all directions, but only those moving towards the detector walls will reach it. So the ones that reach the walls are those that can travel the distance within their lifetime.

Let me think about the variables involved. The key points are:

- The radius of the detector is 30 meters. So the maximum distance a particle can travel to reach the wall is 30 meters.

- The particles are produced at the center, so any direction is possible. But since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is approximately the speed of light, but we'll need to calculate based on their gamma factor.

Wait, the particles are ultra-relativistic, so their velocity v is approximately c. So maybe I can approximate v â‰ˆ c, but perhaps I need to be more precise.

The problem says that one third reach the walls when gamma is 20. Now, when gamma is higher, the lifetime of the particle from the lab frame's perspective increases, so more of them would reach the walls.

Hmm, but how is the number of particles reaching the detector related to gamma?

I think the number of particles that reach the detector depends on the time they live and their velocity
