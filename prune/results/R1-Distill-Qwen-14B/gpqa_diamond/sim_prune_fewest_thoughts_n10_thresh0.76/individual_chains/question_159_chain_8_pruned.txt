Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me think. I remember that quasars are very bright objects, often associated with black holes in the early universe. The question mentions observations in near-infrared and optical spectrum, with a peak at 790 nm and flux dropping below that. Wait, I think that has to do with redshift and the Lyman-alpha forest or something like that. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But if the flux drops below 790 nm, maybe that's the rest frame emission being redshifted.

Wait, so the peak is at 790 nm. If the rest wavelength is 121 nm (Lyman-alpha), then the observed wavelength is longer because of redshift. So the redshift z would be (observed - rest)/rest. So (790 - 121)/121. Let me calculate that: 790 minus 121 is 669. 669 divided by 121 is approximately 5.528. So z is around 5.528.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. Comoving distance D_C is related to the redshift. The formula for comoving distance in a flat universe is D_C = (c / H0) * ∫(1 / E(a)) da, where E(a) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). But for a flat universe, Ω_m + Ω_lambda = 1, so E(a) at scale factor a is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda*(1)).

Wait, the integral is from a=0 to a=1/(1+z), right? Because a=1 is today, so for a quasar at redshift z, the scale factor is a = 1/(1+z). So here, z is about 5.5, so a is 1/(6.5)=0.1538.

But calculating that integral analytically might be tricky, especially since it's a definite integral from 0 to a. I think for a flat universe with matter and dark energy, there's a standard expression or maybe an approximation to compute the comoving distance.

Alternatively, I remember that for certain redshifts, the comoving distance can be looked up in tables or approximated using formulas. Let me think about the Hubble constant given: 70 km/s/Mpc. So c is about 3e5 km/s, and 1/H0 is about 14 billion years (since H0 is 70, and 1/H0 is roughly 100/(H0) billion years). Wait, wait: 70 km/s/Mpc is H0. 1/H0 = (1 Mpc)/(70 km/s) * c. Wait, maybe that's getting me confused. Alternatively, 1/H0 in units of Mpc/(km/s) is (1 Mpc) / (70 km/s) = (3.086e19 m) / (7e4 m/s) )^{-1} ? Hmm, maybe a different approach.

Wait, the Hubble distance is c / H0. Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 = (3e5 km/s) / (70 km/s/Mpc) ) = (3e5 /70 ) Mpc. Let me compute that: 3e5 is 300,000. Divided by 70: about 4285.7 Mpc. So that's about 4.2857 Gpc. So 1/H0 is roughly 4.28 Gpc.

Wait, but that's just the Hubble distance. The comoving distance for a given redshift depends on the integral. For low redshifts (z << 1), D_C is approximately cz/H0, but for higher z, it's larger because the universe expands as you go back in time.

At high redshifts, the universe's expansion history affects the comoving distance. So with z=5.5, the comoving distance would be larger than the Hubble distance, but how much exactly?

I think for a flat universe with matter density Ω_m=0.3 and dark energy Ω_λ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5.5 can be found using numerical integration or lookup tables.

Wait, I remember that for z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc when H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. For higher z, it increases. Let's think: z=2, D_C is around 4-5 Gpc. At z=5, I think it's more
