Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So, in our real world, we know that magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't have just one isolated pole. But in this scenario, that's possible. How would that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. I remember them as:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E is proportional to the charge density.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is related to the time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of B is related to the current density plus the displacement current.

So the question is asking which of these equations would change if isolated magnetic poles (monopoles) exist. Let me break it down.

In our world, Gauss's Law for magnetism says that ∇·B = 0. This means there are no magnetic monopoles because the divergence of B is zero. So if we have monopoles, the divergence of B wouldn’t be zero anymore. So equation 2 would definitely change. But wait, what about the other equations?

Faraday's Law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t) – does that change? I don't think so. Because it relates the changing B field to the electric field's curl. Even with monopoles, the relation might still hold, but maybe there's an extra term. Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, in the presence of magnetic currents, would this equation change?

Wait, I think when magnetic monopoles are present, the Maxwell equations get modified. Let me recall. Oh right, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of B would not be zero anymore. Also, another Maxwell equation (Faraday's Law) would get a similar term, but with magnetic current density.

Wait, in the standard equations, the divergence of B is zero because there are no magnetic charges. If there are isolated magnetic poles, then the divergence of B would not be zero. It would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So
