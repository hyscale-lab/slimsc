Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. Let's see what I remember about wave functions and normalization.

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex function. But in this case, it's written as a combination of a real term and an imaginary term. Oh wait, the wave function can be complex, but when we're talking about its modulus squared for probability, we have to square the absolute value, so maybe that's okay.

Wait, but the wave function is supposed to be a solution to the Schrödinger equation, so it should be continuous and square-integrable, right? Also, normalization requires that the integral of the probability density |ψ(x)|² over all space is 1.

The problem states that none of the particles were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So that suggests that the wave function is zero outside of this interval. Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me see. Wait, wait—no, that can't be right. Because if the wave function is given that way, then it's non-zero outside x=1 to 3? Or is the wave function only defined (i.e., non-zero) between 1 and 3?

Wait, the question says that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x<1 and x>3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid in that region, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

So, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, but this is only for x between 1 and 3. Elsewhere, it's zero. So to normalize, we need to integrate |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 and set it equal to 1.

Wait, but the wave function is a complex number. So ψ(x) = A (x) + B i, where A and B are real functions. The modulus squared is |ψ(x)|² = A² + B².

So let's write ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So A is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5.

So the modulus squared would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because when you square the modulus, it's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 should be equal to 1.

So integrating [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Let me compute that integral step by step.

First, break it into two integrals:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x)] dx + Integral from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

The first integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln 2 - ln 2 = ln 2.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check:

At x=3, 1+x=4. At x=1, 1+x=2. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that term is a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding both parts: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) approximately equals 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7219.

Then a = sqrt(0.7219) ≈ 0.85.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer. Let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the integral. The first integral is a squared times ln(2). The second integral is 0.25 times (3-1) which is 2, so 0.5. Summing them gives a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1. So a² ln(2) =0.5, so a²= 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7219. So a is sqrt of that, which is about 0.85. So yeah, option B.


To determine the normalization constant \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

where the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and zero elsewhere. The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( [1, 3] \) equals 1. The probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

### First Integral:
The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2),
\]

since \( \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2) \).

### Second Integral:
The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( [1, 3] \) is:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two integrals:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \implies \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7219 \quad \implies \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7219} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the numerical value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
