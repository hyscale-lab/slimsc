Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about reacting (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr) and then looking at the TLC results. The reactant spot has diminished, and two new spots have appeared. I need to figure out what the products could be.

Hmm, first, I should draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether group is O connected to a butenyl group. Butenyl means there's a double bond. The substituents on the butenyl are 2,2-dimethyl. So, the structure would be a benzene ring with an O- attached to a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group, but wait, wait. Let me think. Wait, butenyl is four carbons, right? So the structure is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me clarify. The but-3-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH=CH? No, wait, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2, but the substituents are on the second and third carbons? Wait, maybe I should write it more accurately.

Wait, the but-3-en-1-yl group is: position 1 is the point of attachment. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, but that's but-1-ene. Wait, no. The but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but but-3-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2? Wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, no, I think more accurately, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH-
