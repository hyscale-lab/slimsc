Okay, I need to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's start by understanding what's being asked. So, the question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, their products are run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, what's mCPBA? Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation. So, when mCPBA reacts with alkenes, it forms epoxides. Epoxidation is an addition reaction where the double bond becomes an epoxide (a three-membered cyclic ether).

But wait, the stereochemistry of the alkene matters here. For each diastereomer, the epoxidation might lead to different products. Wait, no, mCPBA tends to cause epoxidation with some stereochemical outcome.

Wait, mCPBA adds the oxygen in a way that the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry. Since mCPBA is a peracid, it's a pericyclic reaction, specifically an electrocyclic ring-opening or addition? Hmm, no, epoxidation is a concerted process where the peracid adds across the double bond. The reaction is stereospecific. So, for a trans double bond (E), the epoxide will have a certain configuration, and for a cis (Z) double bond, another configuration.

Wait, but when you have an E-alkene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. So when mCPBA adds, the epoxide forms in such a way that the oxygen bridges the two carbons. Let me think. The peracid's oxygen adds to each carbon, so the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact outcome. Let me recall: when mCPBA reacts with a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Or is it that the epoxide ends up with the opposite configuration? Hmm, I think that for mCPBA, which is an electrophilic peracid, the epoxidation is stereospecific
