Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it has two substituents on a benzene ring, right? The FTIR shows an ester group, so there's an O-C-O group somewhere. Ester groups typically have strong absorption bands around 1740 cm⁻¹, which would show up in the IR. 

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be in different positions. If they are para, the aromatic protons would be two sets: maybe two doublets each with two protons. Wait, but in this case, the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests that there are two different environments for the aromatic protons. So maybe the substituents are in the ortho positions? Or perhaps one substituent is in the para position and another is in a different position, leading to two distinct sets of aromatic Hs. Hmm, but wait, di-substituted could also mean that the substituents are adjacent (ortho) or across (para). If they are para, the aromatic Hs might be in two sets of two each. Or maybe one substituent is a strong de-shielder, causing more splitting. Not entirely sure yet.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets when attached to a substituent with another proton. Like in an ester group, where the ester might have a CH₂CH₂O or something? Wait, no. Wait, the substituents on the benzene could be ester groups. So for example, if one substituent is an ester like O-CO-O, but that doesn't have vinyl Hs. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH₂=CH- group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is an ester. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like maybe a propenoate or something.

Wait, the vinyl Hs—so, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group attached to the benzene. For example, a styryl group (like CH₂=CH- attached to the ring). The vinyl Hs would then have coupling with neighboring protons. So, in a vinyl group, the two Hs on either end would each couple with each other. But in the NMR, the signals are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. 

Wait, a doublet would mean each H is coupled with one other H. A doublet of quartets suggests that each H is coupled with two other sets of Hs. Hmm, maybe that's a bit more complex. For example, if a CH₂ group is next to another CH₂, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl Hs are part of a conjugated system, like in an ester group. Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached, like perhaps an allyl ester or something. 

Let me think. An ester group is O-CO-O. So if one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R, where R might be a substituent. If R is an alkyl group, perhaps with vinyl groups. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a vinyl group and an ester group. So the benzene ring has two substituents: one is a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) and the other is an ester group.

But wait, in the NMR, the vinyl Hs are two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So maybe one of the vinyl Hs is coupled with more than one other set of Hs. Like, if the vinyl group is adjacent to another group that has Hs. For example, in a structure like CH₂=CH-O
