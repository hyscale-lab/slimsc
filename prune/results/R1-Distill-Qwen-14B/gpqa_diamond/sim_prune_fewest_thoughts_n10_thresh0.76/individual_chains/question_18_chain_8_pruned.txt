Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step.

So the question says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here. Maybe the problem is more about the abundances, so perhaps the masses are just extra info. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the elements.

The given data are the elemental abundances determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. The values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

Wait, what do these [X/Y] notation mean? Oh right, [X/Y] is log10(n_X / n_Y) where n is the number density. And it's usually relative to the Sun. So for example, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. If [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) )=0 → log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun. So the Fe abundance is same as Sun in Star_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3. Since nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun, nFe1 = nFe_sun * (nH1/nH_sun). Hmm, maybe it's easier to express ratios relative to H.

Wait, let me think. For Star_1:

nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

Similarly, for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1 / nFe1) = log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) + 0.3.

But since nFe1 is (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1,

nSi1 = nFe1 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, let me write this out.

[Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

Therefore, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1 → nFe1 = (nFe_sun
