Okay, I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me start by understanding the setup.

So, the researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse where GADD45G is overexpressed. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a plasmid, used Lipofectamine, and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. Now, looking at the DNA sequence provided, I need to find the issue.

Hmm, the construct's plus strand sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me check whether the reading frame is correct. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA... Wait, let me write out the first few codons.

First codon: ATG (start, methionine)
Second codon: TAC (tyrosine)
Third: CCC (proline)
Fourth: ATA (isoleucine)
Fifth: CGA (arginine)
Sixth: TGT (cysteine)
Seventh: TCC (serine)
Eighth: AGA (arginine)
Wait, that's the second codon. Wait, wait. Let me re-examine. 

Wait, the sequence is 5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA ... So each three nucleotides make a codon, right?

So codons are:

1. ATG - Met (start)
2. TAC - Tyr
3. CCC - Pro
4. ATA - Ile
5. CGA - Arg
6. TGT - Cys
7. TCC - Ser
8. AGA - Arg
9. TAC - Tyr
10. GAC - Asp
Wait, wait, let me count. Maybe I'm getting the reading wrong.

Wait, the entire sequence is a long string. Let me write it out in triplets:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TAC GAC CAA TGA CCA AAA G
