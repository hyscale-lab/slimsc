Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says both systems are binary stars and exhibit eclipses. The periods are given as 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. Oh wait, periods in eclipsing binaries usually refer to the orbital period, right? So that's the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other once.

Then, there's information about radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity curves are related to the masses of the stars. The more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude because it's moving less due to the gravitational pull of the other star.

Wait, right! The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. So if star A has a higher K, it's less massive. Because the heavier star doesn't move as much; the lighter one moves more around the center of mass.

So, in each system, the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2 is related to the mass ratio. Let me think, the formula comes from the fact that the two stars orbit their common center of mass. So their masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2, where K1 is the velocity of the more massive star and K2 the less massive. Wait, no, actually, the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, assuming they're orbiting each other with the same period.

Wait, the two stars in a binary system have velocities K1 and K2. The mass ratio M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1). Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1 = (K2/K1) * M2. So the mass ratio is K2 over K1.

But wait, each system has two stars with velocities. Let me clarify. For each system, the velocities of the two stars are K1 and K2, so M1/M2 = K2/(K1). Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, from the center of mass condition.

But wait, the problem states that in system_1, the RV variations are 10 and 5 km/s. So which one is which? Which is the primary star? Or does it not matter because the system's total mass depends on both, regardless of which is primary?

Hmm, the problem says the mass of the system is the sum of the two masses. So for each system, I need to find M_total = M1 + M2.

But how do I get M1 and M2?

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes are proportional to (M2 sin i)/(M1 + M2) and (M1 sin i)/(M1 + M2), assuming edge-on orbits (so sin i is 1, which is the case for eclips
