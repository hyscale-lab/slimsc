Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. So, a chemist found an unnamed bottle with a white solid, and he has some spectral data to figure out what it is. The options are four different compounds, and I need to match the spectral data to one of them.

The data provided includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR. I'll go through each piece of data step by step.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. Then there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, a molecular ion plus two? Or maybe it's a fragment. Alternatively, the molecular ion could have a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5, so the common isotope is 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So, if the molecular formula includes Cl, the molecular ion would have different peaks based on isotopic composition.

Wait, the molecular ion is at 156, which is an even mass. So possible that the molecular formula has an even number of nitrogen atoms or something else. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But substituting with Cl and OH groups.

Wait, let me compute each option's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's see: C is 12*7=84, H is 5=5, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16*2=32. Total is 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Oh, but the molecular ion is at 156, so maybe that's close enough because exact masses can vary, and sometimes the way it's calculated could be rounded. Also, I remember that the molecular ion might not always be exact, considering isotopic peaks.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A? Wait, benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. So substituting Cl at 4-position. So molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2 as well. Let me calculate: C7 (84) + H5 (5) + Cl (35.5) + O2 (32) = 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So same as option A. So molecular weight is approximately 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156. So perhaps this is possible, but wait, the molecular ion is at 156, and the other peak is at 158. Wait, the M+ is at 156, and then another peak at 158 (32%). How does that fit?

Wait, in mass spec, the molecular ion can have isotopic peaks. For chlorine, which is a common isotope, the molecular ion would have peaks at M and M+2 (since Cl has a double isotope, so 35Cl is 75%, 37Cl is 25%). So if the molecular formula has one Cl, the major peak would be at M (156) and a smaller peak at M+2 (158). The relative intensities would depend on the number of Cl atoms. Let me think.

If the molecule contains one Cl, then the molecular ion will have peaks at 156 and 158. The intensity ratio is based on the natural abundance of Cl
