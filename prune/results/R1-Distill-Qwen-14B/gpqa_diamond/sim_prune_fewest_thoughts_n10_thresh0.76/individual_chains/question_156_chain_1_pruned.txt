Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about reactions with mCPBA and HPLC analysis. Let me go through it step by step.

First, the question involves two reactions, each starting with a different isomer of oct-4-ene: (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. The products are then combined and run on HPLC columns â€” both a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the stereochemistry of the starting alkene will influence the configuration of the epoxide, right?

Epoxidation of alkenes typically proceeds via an electrocyclic ring-opening mechanism. For a trans double bond (E geometry), the epoxidation would lead to a trans epoxide. Conversely, a cis double bond (Z geometry) would form a cis epoxide. Wait, no, is that correct? Or does it form a trans epoxide regardless? Hmm, I think I need to think about this more clearly.

Wait, no, the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. Let me visualize this. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. When mCPBA attacks the double bond, it adds the oxygen across the double bond. For an E-alkene, the addition would lead to a trans epoxide because the substituents on each carbon of the epoxide would be opposite. Similarly, a Z-alkene would form a cis epoxide because the substituents would be on the same side after epoxidation.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing this up. Another approach: The mechanism of epoxidation by mCPBA involves a cyclic transition state where the peracid adds across the double bond. The transition state leads to the formation of the epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide. For a trans (E) starting alkene, the epoxide will have the two new oxygen bonds in a trans configuration. Similarly,
