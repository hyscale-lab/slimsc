Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about density matrices, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question shows a density matrix ρ, which is equal to (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are points in three-dimensional space with coordinates A through D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum computing, a qubit can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of a qubit state in a two-dimensional space, which is embedded in three dimensions. So each qubit state |ψ> can be written as a vector on the Bloch sphere.

But wait, the question is about a density matrix. Oh right, density matrices describe mixed states, not just pure states. So I need to think about how density matrices relate to the Bloch sphere.

I recall that for a density matrix ρ, it can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere using the formula: ρ = (I + r · σ)/2, where r is a vector in three-dimensional space, and σ represents the Pauli matrices. The vector r gives the coordinates of the point on the Bloch sphere.

So the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Let me write that out. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them would give a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonals. Multiplying by 1/2 makes it:

ρ = 1/2 * [ [1, 0], [0, 1] ].

Wait, that's the same as the identity matrix multiplied by 1/2. Because [ [1,0],[0,1] ] is I, so ρ = (I)/2.

Now, using the formula ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's equate that to ρ = I/2. So,

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2. I = I + r·σ.

Subtract I from both sides: 0 = r·σ.

The Pauli matrices σ are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

Setting 0 = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

But each Pauli matrix is non-zero. The only way this equation holds is if all components of r are zero. Because if any of them were non-zero, then r·σ would have non-zero elements, which can't happen if the entire thing equals zero.

So r must be (0,0,0). Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0).

Wait wait, but I should make sure. What does r represent? Oh right, for a pure state, r would lie on the surface of the Bloch sphere (since the state is normalized and pure), but for a mixed state, like a completely mixed state, it's at the center (r=0). Because the completely mixed state has maximum entropy.

In this case, ρ is equal to I/2, which is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. So it makes sense that r is zero. That would put it at the origin, which is (0,0,0), option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

Density matrices can be related to the Bloch sphere representation using the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in three-dimensional space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), we find:

\[
\frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:

\[
I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = I.
\]

Subtracting \(I\) from both sides yields:

\[
\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0.
\]

The Pauli matrices \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are non-zero, so the only solution is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in three-dimensional space, which is the geometric representation of the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
