Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. It radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they're asking for the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the form of f.

Wait, I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle. Oh right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is such that the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sin theta)^2, right? Because the radiation is strongest in the equatorial plane (theta=90 degrees). So the maximum would be at theta=90, but wait, the question is about theta=30 degrees. Hmm, let me think.

The function f(theta) would be something like f(theta) = sin^2(theta), so when theta is 30 degrees, sin(30) is 0.5, so sin^2 is 0.25. So the fraction would be 1/4 of the maximum. But wait, the maximum is not necessarily at theta=30, but the maximum power A occurs where? Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. The maximum value of f would be when sin(theta) is maximum, which is at theta=90 degrees. So the maximum A would be the maximum value of f, which is 1 (since sin^2(90) is 1). Therefore, at theta=30 degrees, the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4 of A.

So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, what about the form of f? What's the dependence on lambda? I remember that the radiated power per unit solid angle (the intensity) for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (1/lambda^4) * sin^2(theta). Because the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to (d^2 p/dt^2)^2, and the dipole moment p varies sinusoidally, leading to terms involving lambda^-4.

So f(theta) is proportional to (1/lambda^4)
