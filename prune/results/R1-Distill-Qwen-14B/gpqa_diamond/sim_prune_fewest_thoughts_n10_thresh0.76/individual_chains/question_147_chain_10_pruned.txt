Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with various fractions of the speed of light.

Wait, so particles and antiparticles annihilating to produce other particles. I remember that in such processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Or wait, if it's moving slowly, perhaps we can approximate it as being at rest? Wait, no, because the initial particles are p and p̄. Oh, wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps both are moving, but the antiproton is moving but slowly.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm. So the proton and antiproton are colliding. Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps in the lab frame the proton is stationary. Or maybe the center of mass frame is considered. Wait, perhaps the antiproton is moving, but its velocity is low, so its energy is approximately its rest mass energy plus a small kinetic energy.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about their rest masses. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². But the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. So each A particle has a rest mass of 300 MeV.

So, the initial system has a proton and antiproton. The proton is at rest, perhaps, or maybe both are moving. Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving at a low speed. So in this case, the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton. But since it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate that the momentum is small compared to the rest mass.

Wait, but in annihilation processes, the initial energy and momentum must equal the final energy and momentum. So the initial particles are p and p̄, and the final are two A+ and two A-
