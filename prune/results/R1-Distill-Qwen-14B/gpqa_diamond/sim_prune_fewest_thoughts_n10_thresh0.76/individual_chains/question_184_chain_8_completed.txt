Okay, so I need to figure out which reaction sequence leads to the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: an ethoxy group, a nitro group, and a tert-butyl group. So, I need to think about how to introduce these groups in the right positions.

Wait, benzene is symmetric, so the order of substitution matters a lot. Nitration and alkylation are both electrophilic substitution reactions, so they typically happen in the order that allows for the most stable intermediates.

Let me draw the structure. The substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, numbering the ring, the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3. Wait, no, the substituents are 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro? Or is it o-, m-, p- positions? Let me think: the numbering would be such that the substituents are in the correct positions.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, they are ortho to each other? Or meta?

Wait, not necessarily. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's fix the ethoxy at position 1. Then the tert-butyl is at position 2 (next to it), and nitro is at position 3 (which is adjacent to ethoxy). Wait, no, that would make ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2 (ortho), and nitro at 3 (which is meta to ethoxy). Hmm, or maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in specific orientations. But maybe more importantly, I need to think about how to get these substituents in the correct positions.

So, to get all three substituents, I need to perform three substitution reactions. The order of adding these groups will determine the final positions because each new substituent directs the next substitution.

Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the directing groups. For example, activating groups (like -OEt, tert-butyl) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like nitro) are meta directors.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So once nitro is present, it will direct incoming substituents to meta positions relative to itself.

So, I need to figure out the best order to add these groups. Let's think.

Option 1: Add the ethoxy group first. Then add tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but if I add ethoxy first, it's an activating group, so the next substitution (tert-butyl) would go ortho or para. Then, when adding nitro, which is a meta director, it would go where?

Alternatively, maybe add nitro last, since it's deactivating and could influence the positions of the remaining substituents.

Wait, another approach: Considering the product, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that they are adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions, forming a meta arrangement? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should try to plan a synthesis pathway.

Let me consider each substituent:

1. tert-butyl group: This is a bulky substituent. It's usually introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which requires a Lewis acid catalyst like AlCl3. However, Friedel-Crafts doesn't work with strongly activating groups, but wait, it's about the directing. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating (alkyl) group and is ortho/para directing.

2. Ethoxy group: This is an activating, ortho/para director.

3. Nitro group: Deactivating, meta director.

So, the order in which these groups are introduced will determine their positions.

I think introducing nitro last might be a good strategy because once the nitro group is present, it's deactivating and will influence the positions of any further substituents. But in this molecule, we have all three substituents, so maybe we have to add nitro in the middle.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or another order.

Wait, let me think of the steps:

Suppose I start with benzene.

1. Introduce tert-butyl group. So, benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride using AlCl3. That gives tert-butylbenzene. The substituent is in a certain position, but since benzene is symmetric, we can just assume it's attached at a position, say position 1.

2. Next, introduce ethoxy group. Ethoxy is OEt, so that's an ether group. To introduce an ethoxy group via electrophilic substitution, perhaps we can use a nitration followed by some steps, but wait, that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform an etherification reaction. Wait, how is ethoxy introduced? Typically, via a nucleophilic substitution, but in aromatic substitution, it's more likely to be via an electrophilic attack. So perhaps using a tosylate or similar. Alternatively, perhaps via a nitration followed by some reduction, but that might complicate things.

Wait, no. For introducing an ethoxy group, perhaps we can use a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires a strongly activated ring and leaving groups. Alternatively, maybe we can use the William's ether synthesis, but that's typically for aliphatic ethers.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl bromide, but wait, Friedel-Crafts is for alkyl halides. Oh, wait, but ethyl bromide is a primary alkyl halide, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation may not work well with primary because of carbocation rearrangements. So maybe we need to use a different method. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, like using a nitration to form a nitro group, then reduce it to an amino group, and then perform some reaction, but that seems a bit involved.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options given. Each option lists a sequence of reactions, so perhaps I can look at each option and see which one makes sense.

Looking at the target compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (adjacent to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (which is adjacent to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in a meta arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find which substituents are added first, second, third.

Let me think of the order of substituents being added:

Suppose the first substituent is the tert-butyl group. Then, the ring is activated, so the next substituent (ethoxy) will be added either ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Then, the nitro group will be added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the first substituent is the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro.

But given that nitro is a strong deactivating group, adding it last might be better because once added, it could hinder further reactions.

Wait, but the target has three substituents, so all three must be introduced.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl first. So we have tert-butylbenzene.

2. Then add ethoxy. Since the ring is activated by the tert-butyl group, the ethoxy group will enter either ortho or para. Let's say it's para, but that may complicate the positions for the nitro group.

Wait, actually, when you have a tert-butyl group on benzene, the next substitution (ethoxy) will be directed to ortho or para. Let's say we get tert-butyl in position 2. Then, adding ethoxy would go to position 6 (ortho) or position 4 (para). Hmm, but in the target, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2. So perhaps the first substituent is ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the first substituent is ethoxy. Then, the next is tert-butyl, which would be directed to ortho or para relative to ethoxy. Then, adding nitro would be directed based on existing substituents.

Wait, but let's think about each step:

First substituent: ethoxy. Then, the ring is activated, so the second substituent could be tert-butyl, which would enter ortho or para to ethoxy. Let's say it's para, but then the nitro group would be added either ortho or meta to the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to add the nitro group after some substituents are in place.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each substituent's activating or deactivating nature.

The ethoxy group is activating, so it would direct incoming groups to ortho and para positions.

The tert-butyl group is activating, so same as above.

The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing.

So, to have all three substituents, perhaps the ethoxy and tert-butyl need to be added first, and then the nitro group is added in a position that's meta to one of them.

Wait, but the target has all three substituents. So, perhaps the order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Then add tert-butyl group, which goes ortho or para to ethoxy.

3. Then add nitro group, which will be directed by the existing substituents.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). Hmm, that might complicate things because once nitro is introduced, it's a meta director.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last. Because if the ring already has ethoxy and tert-butyl, adding nitro would go into a position that's meta to either of them.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So that's not meta. So that suggests that the nitro group isn't last.

Wait, maybe the nitro is added after one of the other substituents, but before the third.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added first, but that seems unlikely because then the ring would be deactivating, making it harder to add other groups.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Looking at the options, each has a series of reactions. Let's consider option D:

D) i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr

Hmm, step i is nitration. So, first step is nitration of benzene. That would give nitrobenzene. Then step ii is Fe/HCl, which is probably a reduction step (like using Fe as a reducing agent, maybe to reduce nitro group to amine? But nitrobenzene doesn't react with Fe/HCl, unless it's under some conditions. Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is sometimes used in the Bechamp reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitration step again.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step in each option.

Let me try to process each option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene becomes tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So nitro group is added. Now, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro groups. The nitro group is a meta director, so the next substituent (if added) would go meta to nitro and ortho/para to tert-butyl. But the target has three substituents, so perhaps another step.

Wait, but the target has ethoxy as well. So, after nitration, perhaps another step is needed. Then step iii is SO3/H2SO4, which is sulfonation. Then step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is diazotization. But benzene already has nitro and tert-butyl groups.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the steps in each option and see which sequence introduces the groups in the correct order.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced through a substitution on a nitro group.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituents and their directing effects.

The ethoxy group is activating (ortho/para). The tert-butyl group is activating (ortho/para). The nitro group is deactivating (meta).

Suppose the first substituent is ethoxy. Then, the next substituent is tert-butyl, which would be added ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, the nitro group would be added in a position that is meta to either the ethoxy or the tert-butyl.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is adjacent to both ethoxy and tert-butyl, which suggests it's in a position that's ortho to one of them, which doesn't fit the meta direction.

Hmm, perhaps the nitro is added first. But then the ring is deactivating, making it harder to add other substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added after ethoxy and tert-butyl have been added.

Wait, another possibility: The nitro group is introduced as a nitroso or through some other intermediate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a nitration step after some other substituents have been added.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

2. Add tert-butyl group, which is ortho to ethoxy.

3. Then, nitrate the ring in a position that's meta to one of the substituents. But with two substituents, the direction could be a bit tricky.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). So maybe the nitro is added between ethoxy and tert-butyl, which would be an ortho position relative to each? But nitro is meta director, so that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added in the position where it's meta to the ethoxy. So, if ethoxy is at position 1, then meta would be position 4. But in the target, nitro is at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro is added in the position meta to the tert-butyl group. If tert-butyl is at position 2, then meta would be position 5. But the target has nitro at 3.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3.

So, substituent 1: ethoxy at position 1.

Substituent 2: tert-butyl at position 2.

Substituent 3: nitro at position 3.

So, the nitro is at position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy (position 1) and meta to tert-butyl (position 2).

Wait, no. Position 1 and 3 are meta to each other. Because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3 would have 1 and 3 being meta, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to number the substituents so that they are adjacent. So, if ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3, then nitro is adjacent to both ethoxy and tert-butyl, which might complicate the directing.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added in a position that's ortho to one substituent and meta to another. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the positions.

Perhaps looking back at the reaction options would help. Let's look at option D again.

Option D steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine? But that would be a substitution. Wait, Fe and HCl are used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines, but typically under heat. So nitrobenzene would become phenylamine? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Fe/HCl is sometimes used in the production of diazonium salts. Wait, diazonium salts are made using NaNO2 and HCl, not Fe. So maybe step ii is a different step.

Wait, maybe step ii is a hydrolysis or some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a demethylation or something else. I'm not certain.

Moving on, step iii is tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So if step i was nitration, giving nitrobenzene, then step ii might be a reduction. Let's say nitrobenzene is reduced to aniline. Then, step iii would be Friedel-Crafts alkylation—wait, but Friedel-Crafts doesn't work on aniline because it's a strong activating group, and AlCl3 would be a catalyst for electrophilic substitution, but aniline is already a strong director.

Wait, maybe after nitration, step ii is something else. I'm getting a bit stuck on this.

Alternatively, perhaps option D's steps are: nitrate → reduce → Friedel-Crafts → nitrate again → diazotization → sulfonation → sulfuric acid treatment → acid workup → NaOH and EtBr.

Hmm, that seems complicated.

Let me think about the target molecule again. It has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. So, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution. How is ethoxy introduced? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution, but that's more common in aliphatic compounds. Alternatively, perhaps via a methyl group being converted into an ethoxy group, but that's not straightforward.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group. For example, nitrobenzene is converted to phenyl diazonium chloride, which can undergo substitution with an ethoxide ion. But that would require a diazonium salt.

Wait, but in the target, the substituents are all directly attached to the benzene ring. So perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an electrophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nitration followed by some reduction. For example, nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene, then reduce the nitro group to amine, then perform some alkylation to introduce an ethoxy group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride, but as I thought earlier, Friedel-Crafts might not work well with primary alkyl halides due to carbocation rearrangements.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be activated, perhaps with strong activating groups. For example, if the ring has a nitro group, but that's deactivating. Alternatively, if the ring has a strong activating group like an amino group, which is a good director.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think about each option again.

Looking at option B:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now the ring has t-butyl and nitro groups.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro group? If nitro is present, Fe/HCl would reduce it to amine? Then, step iv is another nitration (HNO3/H2SO4). But why nitrate again? Maybe to add another nitro group, but the target has only one nitro group.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation → adds a sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this might not be the right path.

Option A:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → t-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate → t-butyl nitrobenzene.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine? Then, step iv is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

Wait, but after reduction, you have an amine. Then diazotization would require an amine, yes. So, step iv would form a diazonium salt. Then step v is H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to form a phenol. But the target has an ethoxy group, not a hydroxyl group. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps step viii in option A is NaOH and EtBr, which is an SN2 reaction, perhaps introducing an ethoxy group via substitution. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence in option D is better. Let me think through option D's steps again.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so Friedel-Crafts would be possible. So, aniline would undergo alkylation at ortho or para positions.

So, step iii would add t-butyl group to aniline. So, aniline → t-butylaniline, with the t-butyl group in ortho or para.

Step iv is HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, the ring has nitro (from step i), amine (from step ii), and t-butyl (step iii). Wait, but after step ii, the ring has an amine, which is a strong activating group.

Wait, nitration would occur where? The amine is at position 1, t-butyl at position 2 (assuming it's para). So nitration would be directed by the amine, which is ortho/para. So nitro would go into position 3 or 4. But in the target, nitro is at position 3.

Hmm. Then step v is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. But the ring has an amine group (from step ii), which would react with NaNO2 and HCl to form a diazonium salt. Then, step vi is SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Then, step vii is dilute H2SO4. Step viii is H3O+, H2O, heat → hydrolysis. Step ix is NaOH and EtBr → SN2 substitution.

Wait, this seems complicated. Let me try to track the substituents.

After step i: nitro at position 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine → amine at position 1.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts with t-butyl chloride → since amine is a strong activating group, the t-butyl would add in ortho or para to the amine. Let's say it adds para, so position 4.

Step iv: nitration. The ring now has amine at 1 and t-butyl at 4. Nitration would be directed by the amine, which is ortho/para. So nitro could go into position 2 or 3 or 6 (if para to t-butyl). Hmm, but the target's nitro is at position 3.

Wait, perhaps in this scenario, after Friedel-Crafts, the substituents are at 1 and 4. Then, nitration occurs at position 3, which is meta to t-butyl (position 4). Wait, no, t-butyl is at position 4, so meta would be position 1 (where amine is), but that's already occupied. So perhaps it goes to position 2, which is ortho to amine.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should draw this mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration step (step iv) leads to nitro at position 3, which is ortho to the amine (position 1) and meta to t-butyl (position 4).

Wait, position 3 is ortho to amine (position 1) and meta to t-butyl (position 4). So, that could be possible. Then the substituents would be at 1 (amine), 3 (nitro), 4 (t-butyl).

Then step v: NaNO2 and HCl. This would form a diazonium salt from the amine group. Then step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Wait, but after the amine is converted to diazonium salt, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe after forming the diazonium salt, step vi (sulfonation) would add a sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this might not be the right path.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the steps required to introduce each substituent.

We need ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

The ethoxy group is challenging because it's an ether. How is it introduced? One way is via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group and deactivating substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a William's ether synthesis. But that's typically for aliphatic systems.

Wait, another approach: To introduce ethoxy, perhaps use an alkyl halide and perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But as I thought earlier, primary alkyl halides may not work well due to carbocation rearrangements.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group. For example, nitrobenzene can be converted to phenyl diazonium chloride, which can then undergo substitution with an ethoxide ion to form the ethoxy group. But that would require a strongly activated ring and a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution on a nitro group after some activation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think of the steps again.

Assuming the correct order is: ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, considering that the nitro group is deactivating, adding it last would make sense because it would direct the remaining substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added last.

Wait, another thought: The target has three substituents. The order in which they're added could be:

1. tert-butyl

2. nitro

3. ethoxy

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. ethoxy

2. tert-butyl

3. nitro

So ethoxy is first, then tert-butyl, which would be ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, nitro is added as a meta director relative to either substituent.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro is between ethoxy and tert-butyl, which might not fit the meta direction.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which one logically adds the substituents in a way that ends up with the correct positions.

Looking back at option D:

i) Nitrate → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → amine at position 1.

iii) Friedel-Crafts with t-butyl → adds t-butyl either ortho or para to amine.

If t-butyl is added para to amine (position 1), then it's at position 4.

iv) Nitrate again → where? The ring now has amine (position 1) and t-butyl (position 4). Nitration would be directed by the amine, which is ortho/para. So, possible positions are 2, 3, and 6.

If nitro is added at position 3 (meta to t-butyl at 4), then the substituents would be 1 (amine), 3 (nitro), 4 (t-butyl).

v) NaNO2/HCl → form diazonium salt from amine.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Now, the ring has diazonium at 1, nitro at 3, t-butyl at 4. Sulfonation would add a sulfonic acid group, but the target doesn't have that.

Hmm, that seems off. So perhaps option D isn't the right one.

Looking at option C:

i) t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts → t-butylbenzene.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate. Now, ring has t-butyl and sulfonic acid.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Where would nitro go? The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group and meta-directing. So nitro would go meta to t-butyl, perhaps.

But the target has ethoxy, which isn't present here. So option C seems to be introducing sulfonic acid, which isn't in the target. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro group.

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) H3O+/H2O/heat → hydrolysis to form phenol.

vi) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 with ethyl bromide? To introduce ethoxy.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that seems like a lot of steps, and I'm not sure how the substituents would end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce t-butyl.

2. Introduce nitro in a position influenced by t-butyl.

3. Introduce ethoxy in a position influenced by both t-butyl and nitro.

But how?

Wait, let me think again. The target has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, perhaps the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the order of addition would be:

1. ethoxy.

2. tert-butyl (ortho to ethoxy).

3. nitro (meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl). But wait, nitro is meta to ethoxy, which would be position 4 if ethoxy is at 1, but in the target, nitro is at 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. tert-butyl.

2. nitro (meta to tert-butyl).

3. ethoxy (ortho to tert-butyl and meta to nitro).

Wait, let's see. tert-butyl at position 1. Then nitro is added meta to t-butyl, which would be position 4. Then, ethoxy would be added ortho to t-butyl (positions 2 or 6), but then where is the nitro?

Wait, the target has substituents at 1, 2, and 3. So I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitro group added.

2. Ethoxy group added ortho to nitro.

3. tert-butyl group added ortho to ethoxy and meta to nitro.

Hmm, but then the positions would be such that nitro is at 1, ethoxy at 2, tert-butyl at 3. That would fit the target's substituents.

So, would this be possible?

But nitro is a meta director, so ethoxy would be added meta to nitro. Wait, no, nitro is meta director, so substituents would be added meta to it.

Wait, if nitro is at position 1, then adding ethoxy would be meta, which is position 4. Then adding tert-butyl, which would be directed by ethoxy (ortho/para), so positions 3 or 5.

Hmm, but the target has ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

1. Ethoxy at position 1.

2. tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Nitro added at position 3 (which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl).

Wait, but nitro is deactivating and meta directing, so when adding nitro after ethoxy and tert-butyl, where would it go?

The ring has ethoxy (position 1) and tert-butyl (position 2). The next substituent (nitro) would be influenced by both.

Ethoxy is activating, so directs ortho/para. Tert-butyl is activating, also ortho/para.

The positions available are 3, 4, 5, 6. Ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2.

Nitro could go to position 3 (ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl). Because from the perspective of ethoxy, position 3 is ortho, and from tert-butyl at 2, position 3 is meta.

Wait, that might work. So, the nitro would be added to position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl.

But how to achieve that. The nitration would have to be directed by both substituents. The presence of both activating groups would direct the nitro to a position that is ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl.

But I'm not sure about the exact direction. Maybe the nitro would prefer to go to a position that is ortho to ethoxy, which is a stronger director since ethoxy is more activating than tert-butyl? Or perhaps the tert-butyl's steric effects influence the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs under such conditions that the substituents are arranged to allow the nitro to go into position 3.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

Suppose the steps are: ethoxy added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

So, starting with benzene:

1. Ethoxy group introduced. How? Maybe via nitration followed by some reduction steps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride. But as I thought earlier, Friedel-Crafts with ethyl chloride might not work well due to carbocation rearrangements.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the ring is activated.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after adding the tert-butyl group. Because the tert-butyl is a strong activating group, perhaps the ethoxy can be added via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for introducing ether groups. So to introduce an ether, perhaps a different method is needed.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group. So, the steps might be:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Perform some alkylation to introduce an ethoxy group.

But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each option and see which one introduces the substituents in the correct order.

Option D:

Step i: Nitration → nitro at position 1.

Step ii: Reduction → amine at 1.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl at position 4 (para to amine).

Step iv: Nitration → where? Now the ring has amine at 1 and t-butyl at 4. Nitration would be directed by amine, so possible positions are 2, 3, 6.

If nitro is introduced at position 3, which is meta to t-butyl (position 4), then the substituents are 1 (amine), 3 (nitro), 4 (t-butyl).

Then, step v: diazotization → forms diazonium salt from amine.

Step vi: sulfonation → adds sulfonic acid group at position 1, where the amine was. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this seems incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps option D isn't correct.

Looking back, perhaps the correct sequence is in option D: nitration → reduction → alkylation → nitration → diazotization → sulfonation → etc. But I'm not seeing how that leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, and the steps are:

i) Nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce nitro to amine → amine at 1.

iii) Alkylation with t-butyl → t-butyl at 4 (para to amine).

iv) Nitrate again → nitro at 3 (meta to t-butyl and ortho to amine).

v) Diazotize amine → form diazonium.

vi) Sulfonate → add SO3 group at position 1 (where amine was).

Wait, but the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. Alternatively, perhaps step vi is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the diazonium salt, step vi (sulfonation) is not needed, and step vii is dilute H2SO4, which might hydrolyze something else.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate.

ii) Reduce.

iii) Alkylation.

iv) Nitrate again.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Sulfonate.

vii) Dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O, heat.

ix) NaOH and EtBr.

Hmm. Perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced in step ix. Let's see.

Step ix: NaOH and EtBr. That's a typical SN2 reaction, where bromide is replaced by hydroxide, but in this case, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but NaOH and EtBr would be for an SN2 reaction, which would substitute a leaving group with hydroxide. But where is the leaving group?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution. If there's a good leaving group, like a nitro group, but nitro isn't a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after some steps where a group is converted into a leaving group. For example, if there's a nitro group, but I don't think that's a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a William's ether synthesis, but that requires an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. I'm not sure how that would fit into the steps.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to think of the correct order in terms of the substituents and their directing effects.

The target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro in positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

So, when adding the substituents, the order would be such that each new substituent is directed by the existing ones.

So, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add tert-butyl (ortho to ethoxy).

3. Add nitro (meta to ethoxy and ortho to tert-butyl).

But how to achieve that.

Wait, the nitro group is meta to ethoxy, which would place it at position 4 if ethoxy is at 1. But in the target, nitro is at position 3. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added after ethoxy and tert-butyl, but directed by tert-butyl.

So, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Then, nitro is added meta to tert-butyl, which would be position 5. But the target has nitro at 3.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl.

Ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Nitro at 3 (which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl).

But would the nitro go there? Let's think: when adding nitro to a ring that has ethoxy and tert-butyl, the nitro would be directed by both substituents.

Ethoxy is activating, meta would be position 4. Tert-butyl is activating, meta would be position 5. But the nitro is at position 3, which is ortho to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl.

Hmm, perhaps the nitro is directed by both substituents, but I'm not certain.

In any case, the correct sequence of reactions must achieve this.

Looking back, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Introduce ethoxy via Friedel-Crafts (but I'm not sure how, as it's an ether).

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a nitration and reduction.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

a) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

b) Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

c) Alkylation with ethyl bromide via Friedel-Crafts → ethylaniline.

d) Then, nitrate to introduce nitro group.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a nitro group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not entirely convinced.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D because it involves nitration, reduction, alkylation, and then another nitration, which could place the nitro groups correctly.

But I'm not entirely sure. After considering all the options, I think the correct sequence is in option D, which involves nitration first, followed by alkylation, and then another nitration. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: The target has three substituents. The initial steps would add the first two, and the third would be added via a reaction that introduces the third substituent.

In option D, the steps are:

i) Nitrate.

ii) Reduce.

iii) Alkylation.

iv) Nitrate again.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Sulfonate.

vii) Dilute H2SO4.

viii) H3O+, H2O, heat.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Perhaps after step iii, the ring has nitro (position 1), t-butyl (position 4). Then, step iv nitrates it at position 3.

Wait, but after step iii, the ring has amine (position 1), t-butyl (position 4). Nitration would be directed by the amine, which is ortho/para. So nitro would go to position 2, 3, or 6.

Hmm, perhaps nitro is added at position 3.

Then, step v: Diazotize the amine → forms diazonium at position 1.

Step vi: Sulfonate → adds SO3 at position 1.

Hmm, but target doesn't have SO3.

Alternatively, perhaps step vi is a different reaction.

Alternatively, after step v, the ring has diazonium group. Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 could sulfonate another position. Not sure.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Based on the substituent positions and the fact that nitro is meta-directing, I think the correct option is D because it includes multiple nitration steps, which might lead to the correct positions.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents (ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups) in the correct positions on the benzene ring. The target molecule has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). The order of substitution is critical because each substituent influences the positions of subsequent substituents based on its directing effects.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step iii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - This option introduces an unwanted sulfonic acid group, making it incorrect.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step iii: Reduction with Fe/HCl is unclear but likely reduces the nitro group, which contradicts the target molecule.
   - This option does not align with the target molecule's substituents.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step ii: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - This option introduces an unwanted sulfonic acid group, making it incorrect.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step i: Nitration introduces the nitro group.
   - Step ii: Reduction with Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride introduces the tert-butyl group.
   - Step iv: Nitration introduces another nitro group.
   - Step v: Diazotization forms a diazonium salt from the amine group.
   - Step vi: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
   - Step vii: Dilute H₂SO₄ is unclear but likely hydrolyzes the sulfonic acid group.
   - Step viii: H₃O⁺/H₂O/Heat is unclear but may hydrolyze intermediates.
   - Step ix: NaOH/EtBr introduces the ethoxy group via an SN2 reaction.

While Option D introduces an unwanted sulfonic acid group at step vi, it is the only option that logically introduces the substituents in a sequence that could potentially lead to the target molecule. The steps involving nitration, reduction, alkylation, and diazotization align with the need to direct the substituents into the correct positions, despite the inclusion of an additional step that introduces and then removes a sulfonic acid group.

### Conclusion:
Option D is the most plausible sequence of reactions, as it aligns with the required transformations to achieve the target molecule, even though it includes an extra step involving sulfonation and its subsequent removal.
