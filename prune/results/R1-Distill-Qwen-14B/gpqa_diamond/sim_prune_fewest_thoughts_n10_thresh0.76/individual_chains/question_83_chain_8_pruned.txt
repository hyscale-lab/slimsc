Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the titration calculations yet. But let's try to break it down step by step. 

The question says that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. 

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the volumes. 

So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration (let's call it C1) should be calculated using the dilution formula, C1V1 = C2V2. 

Wait, but wait—acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, it dissociates more. But for the initial concentration after dilution, I just need to calculate the molarity. 

Original moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. 

So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid. 

Next, during the titration, we're adding NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is: 
CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. 

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH to form the sodium acetate. The pH at equivalence point for such a salt (from a weak acid and strong base) would depend on the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. 

But first, let's figure out the equivalence point. 

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 moles, as calculated earlier. Since NaOH is a strong base, it'll react in a 1:1 ratio. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 moles. 

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume (V) required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. 

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. Since the equivalence is at 10 cm³, 25% would be 2.5 cm³. 

Wait, no. Wait, 25% titration doesn't necessarily mean 25% of the equivalence volume. Wait, no, actually, in titration terms, 25% titration refers to the volume of titrant (NaOH) added being 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. So yes, if equivalence is at 10 cm³, 25% would be 2.5 cm³. 

Wait, but another thought: when you add 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence, it's sometimes called the first equivalence point, but in this case, it's just 25% of the way to equivalence. So, the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. 

So, moles of NaOH added at 25% titration: 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. 

So, the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH will be 1:1. So, moles of CH3COOH initially 0.001 mol, and 0.00025 mol of NaOH added. So the reaction will convert 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH to CH3COO^- (acetate). 

So, after reaction: 

Moles of CH3COOH left = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. 

Moles of CH3COO^- formed = 0.00025 mol. 

But wait, the total volume now is the initial solution's volume plus the added NaOH. Initial solution was 40 cm³ (20 + 20). The NaOH added at 25% is 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. 

So, the concentrations are: 

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M. 

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approx 0.005882 M. 

Now, at this point, the solution is a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. 

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) 

The pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/1.85e-5) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.73. 

Wait, wait, let me calculate it accurately. 

Ka = 1.85x10^-5.

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) 

Log(1.85) is about 0.267. So pKa is 4.733. Rounded to 4.73. 

So, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. 

So log(0.3333) is about -0.477. 

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. 

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So this would be around 4.25, which is close to option A's first value, 4.26. 

Wait, but let me double-check the exact numbers without approximating. 

Wait, let me compute [A^-] and [HA] precisely.

Moles after reaction:

CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol

CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol

Total volume: 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.0176470588 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.0058823529 M.

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.0058823529)/(0.0176470588) = 1/3 ≈ 0.333333333.

Log(1/3) is log(0.3333) = −0.4771.

So pH = 4.73 −0.4771 = 4.2529, which is approximately 4.25. So the first pH is around 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26, but wait, option D's first value is 4.57. Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution calculation. Let me recheck. 

Wait, initial 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct. 

At 25% titration, the volume of NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. Equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. 

Moles NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. 

Reaction: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

Moles CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. 

Moles CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol. 

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³. 

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M. [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.005882 M. 

Ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333. 

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → 4.73 + (-0.477) = 4.253. So approximately 4.25. 

Looking at options:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52

Option D) 4.57; 6.92 

Hmm, so 4.25 is close to 4.26. So the first part of the answer is 4.26, which is option A's first value. 

But wait, let's check if the equivalence point calculation is correct. 

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic. 

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2
