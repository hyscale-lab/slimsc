Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, right. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so this is a classic acid-base titration. 

First, I think I need to find out the concentrations after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. 

Original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The number of moles of acetic acid before dilution is volume × concentration. So 0.02 liters × 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

After dilution, the concentration is moles divided by new volume: 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid in diluted solution: 0.04 L × 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the diluted solution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Oh wait, wait, the initial 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 0.001 moles, yes. So after adding 20 cm³, same amount, so 0.04 L × 0.025 M = 0.001 mol, correct.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So the volume required at equivalence point is moles / concentration. So 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the first part of the question is about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, alternatively, 25% of the way to the equivalence point means that one quarter of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH.

So when 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added, moles of NaOH added = 0.0025 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol.

Since each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid (because NaOH is strong, so it dissociates completely; CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), the reaction consumes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid and produces 0.00025 mol of acetate ion.

So the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075
