Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem involves salts A and B. They're equimolar, meaning they have the same number of moles. The total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes. 

First, the gases go through anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 in tube №1. Then, into a Ca(OH)2 solution in tube №2. Finally, through red-hot copper in tube №3. 

The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60 grams, tube 3 gains 0.80 grams, and tube 2's weight doesn't change. After all this, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). 

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, I need to figure out what salts A and B are, probably based on the reactions that happen during this process.

Let's break down each step. 

Starting with the gases produced. When salts A and B are heated without air (so probably in an inert atmosphere, maybe?), they decompose. The gases formed are passed through those tubes.

Tube №1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong drying agent. Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water. So if the gases passed through it caused the tube to gain mass, that suggests water was absorbed. So the gas must have contained water vapor, which was removed. The mass of tube 1 increased by 3.60 g, so that's the mass of the water absorbed.

Wait, but actually, Mg(ClO4)2 absorbs water of crystallization. So when the gas passes through, if there's water vapor, it will be captured by the Mg(ClO4)2, which will gain mass. So the mass increase is due to the water in the gas. So the water vapor in the gas mixture was 3.60 g.

Then, the gas moves to tube №2, which is Ca(OH)2 solution. The mass of this tube didn't change. That suggests that there was no CO2 in the gas mixture because Ca(OH)2 would react with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. If the mass didn't change, perhaps there's no CO2. Or maybe the CO2 was already removed earlier? Or maybe it didn't react because of some condition. Wait, but why wouldn't it react? Maybe the solution couldn't absorb any more CO2, but that's probably not it. Alternatively, perhaps the gas after tube 1 didn't contain any CO2, so tube 2 didn't react, keeping its mass the same.

Next is tube №3, which is red-hot copper. The mass of this tube increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. Red-hot copper in the presence of a gas—probably a reaction where the gas is oxidized, transferring electrons. So, this suggests that the gas is a reducing agent. The common gases that react with copper when hot are probably CO or H2, maybe CH4, but in such a scenario, the tube gaining mass would mean that the copper is reacting with the gas to form CuO and releasing some other product. For example, CO would react with Cu at high temperatures to produce CuO and CO2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about each reaction.

In tube 1, the gas has water vapor, which is captured. So the gas mixture after tube 1 is dry.

In tube 2, it's a solution of Ca(OH)2. If the gas after tube 1 doesn't contain CO2, then no reaction would happen. So the gas would pass through without change. But wait, if there was CO2 in the original gas, then tube 2 would
