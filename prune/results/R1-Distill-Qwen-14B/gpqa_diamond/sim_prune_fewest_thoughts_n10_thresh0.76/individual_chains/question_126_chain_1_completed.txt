Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks appear in each case.

So, the first reaction is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. Hexan-3-one is a ketone, right? So LAH would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. Wait, but wait—what's the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one?

Hexan-3-one would be CH3-CO-(CH2)3-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH2CO... Wait, no. Let me draw it:

The structure is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH2- but wait, no. Wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Hexan-3-one has the ketone group on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2CH2-C(O)CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe it's CH2CH2-C(O)-(CH2)3. Wait, perhaps it's better to think as:

Carbon chain is six carbons. The ketone is on the third carbon. So positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, 1: CH3-, 2: CH2-, 3: C=O, 4: CH2-, 5: CH2-, 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Oh, wait, the substituents. So, 5-methoxy means the methoxy group is on carbon 5. So, the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OMe (methoxy)

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at position 3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me write it correctly.

The correct structure of 3-pentanone is (CH2)2COCH2CH3. But for hexan-3-one, it's (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, that would be seven carbons, no. Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. But regardless, the important part is that it's a ketone, and in position 3, and there's a methoxy group at position 5.

So when LAH is used, it's a strong reducing agent. It will reduce the ketone (C=O) to an alcohol (CH(OH)-). So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one will become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. LAH is a strong reducing agent, so it typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product from Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with the configuration S. But wait, when you reduce a ketone with LAH, does the configuration change? No, because the ketone is planar. So the starting material is an S configuration because of the methoxy group, and after reduction, the alcohol is an secondary alcohol. So the configuration of the chiral center (at C3) will be the same as before? Wait, no. Because the ketone is not a chiral center. The starting molecule is (S) at C5? Wait, wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the methoxy is on C5, and the ketone is on C3.

Wait, so the molecule is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, the structure would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: OCH3 attached to it.

Wait, so the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's seven carbons. Wait, hexan means six carbons, so perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, that would make it hexan-3-one with a methoxy on C5. So, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, but that's six carbons. So, when LAH is used to reduce the ketone, it becomes CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, so the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The original molecule had an S configuration at C5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the configuration is at C5. Wait, but wait, C5 in the starting material is a carbon attached to a ketone on C3, and a methoxy group. But wait, let me think about the structure again.

Wait, perhaps the starting molecule is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6.

Positions 1: CH3-

Position 2: CH2-

Position 3: C=O

Position 4: CH2-

Position 5: CH(OCH3)-

Position 6: CH3.

Wait, so C5 is attached to OCH3, and to C4 and C6. So the groups on C5 are: OCH3, CH2 (from C4), and CH3 (from C6), plus the CH2 from C3? No, wait, C5 is connected to C4 (which is CH2 from C3), and to C6 (CH3), and has OCH3. So the groups on C5 are: OCH3, CH2-C(O)-CH2, and CH3, and another CH2? Hmm, maybe that's getting too detailed.

But in any case, the starting molecule is a ketone, and when reduced with LAH, the ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product is an alcohol at C3, and a methoxy at C5. So the configuration at C3 is new, but wait, no, the starting material isn't a chiral center at C3 because it's a ketone. So in the product, C3 becomes a secondary alcohol, which is a chiral center. Because the structure after reduction would be:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the C3 is now a chiral center with four different groups: OH, CH2CH2OCH3CH3, CH2CH2CH3, and the adjacent CH2 groups? Wait, let me think. The groups on C3 would be:

- OH

- CH2-CH2-OCH3 (but wait, the structure is CH3-CH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, the structure after reduction is:

Positions:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: CH(OH)-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong, but regardless, the main point is that the product from Reaction I is (R) or (S) configuration at C3, but the original molecule was (S) at C5? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. That means the configuration at C5 is S.

But when you reduce the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, that creates a new chiral center at C3. So the product from Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: C3 (from the reduction) and C5 (from the starting material). But wait, wait a second. In the starting material, the configuration was S at C5. The product from Reaction I would have an additional chiral center at C3. So the product is a diastereomer, but is it a racemic mixture or a single enantiomer?

No, wait, since LAH is a strong reducing agent and the starting ketone is a single enantiomer, the resulting alcohol would have the configuration determined by the reduction. Wait, but when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration at the new chiral center is determined by the reducing agent. LAH is a chiral reducing agent? No, LAH is a strong reducing agent and usually gives the same configuration as the starting ketone if the starting material is not chiral. Wait, no—actually, the starting material is chiral at C5, but the ketone at C3 is not a chiral center.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone, the product is (R) or (S) depending on the approach of the hydride. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols with the hydride attacking from the less hindered side. But since the starting material is enantioenriched at C5, does that influence the approach of the hydride at C3? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, perhaps the reduction of the ketone (which is not chiral) would give a racemic mixture, but no, wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so maybe the product ends up with a specific configuration at C3 based on the structure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's move to Reaction II for now and come back.

Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)2CO-(CH2)COCH3. So it's a diketone, with ketones on C2 and C4. So structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

When you treat this with NaBH4, which is a reducing agent, but it's a milder agent compared to LAH. Wait, but NaBH4 typically doesn't reduce esters or amides, but it does reduce ketones. However, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. So, what happens when we reduce it with NaBH4?

Each ketone would be reduced to an alcohol. So, the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, each carbonyl would become an alcohol. So, the structure would be (CH3)2CHOH-CH2-C(OH)(CH3) ?

Wait, no: pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. When reduced, each C=O becomes an -OH. So, the product would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So, it's a 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, that's a vicinal diol? No, the diols are at positions 2 and 4. So, the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Now, the question is about the stereochemistry of this product. NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, it's a symmetrical borohydride, so it should reduce ketones to form a racemic mixture, but wait, pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetrical molecule. Let me think: the two ketones are in positions 2 and 4. So, when NaBH4 is used, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. Since the molecule is symmetrical, reducing both ketones would result in the same product regardless of the configuration at each center.

Wait, but reducing each ketone would produce two chiral centers. For each ketone, the reduction could be R or S. But because the molecule is symmetrical, the stereochemistry at C2 and C4 would be the same. So, the possible products are either meso compounds or enantiomers, but since the molecule is symmetrical, the product would be a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, let me think. Suppose that when each ketone is reduced, the hydroxyls are added in the same configuration. So, the product would have OH groups on both C2 and C4. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the diol would have a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule would be meso, and hence not chiral.

So, the product of Reaction II is a meso compound, 2,4-pentanediol. It has two chiral centers, but because of the plane of symmetry, it's not a pair of enantiomers but a single compound, which is achiral. So, the product is a single compound, not a racemic mix.

Now, the products from both reactions are combined. So, I need to figure out what each product is and then see what the combined mixture looks like.

Product I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's break down its structure.

It's (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, the original molecule is (S) at C5. After reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center. But wait, the starting material was (S) at C5, and the reduction at C3 creates a new chiral center. So the product is a diastereomer with two chiral centers.

Wait, but what is the configuration at C3? Since the ketone is being reduced, the hydride comes from the less hindered side. But it's complicated because the starting material is chiral at C5, which may influence the approach of the hydride. However, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the product will have a specific configuration at C3 and retain the configuration at C5.

Wait, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the exact configuration isn't necessary. What's important is the number of chiral centers and whether the products are chiral.

So, Reaction I gives 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So, potentially, four stereoisomers (2^2 =4). But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait, the original molecule is (S) at C5. After reduction, the molecule becomes 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The C3 is a new chiral center, and C5 remains a chiral center. But if the starting material was a single enantiomer, then the product would have a new chiral center. But does the product have two chiral centers, each with a specific configuration, making it a single stereoisomer?

Wait, because the starting material was (S) at C5, and the reduction at C3 would create a new chiral center. Since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer with a specific configuration at both C3 and C5. So, the product from Reaction I is a single compound with two chiral centers, so it's a single stereoisomer (since it's formed from a single stereoisomer of the starting material).

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. LAH is a strong reducing agent that can cause racemization if the chiral center is present. But in this case, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is at C3, which is not a chiral center, but C5 is. So the starting material is chiral at C5, but the ketone is not. So when reducing the ketone, will it create a new chiral center at C3, and the configuration at C5 remains as S?

Assuming that the reduction is stereospecific, perhaps the product after reduction has the configuration R or S at C3, but the original configuration at C5 remains S. So the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

So, Reaction I gives a single product with two chiral centers. So, it's a diastereomer but as a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II gives a meso compound, 2,4-pentanediol. So, it has two chiral centers but is achiral because it's a meso compound. So, it's a single compound.

Now, when the products are combined, what do we have?

Product I: One compound (single stereoisomer) with two chiral centers.

Product II: One compound (meso, single compound) with two chiral centers.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think again: Reaction I produces 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's say that the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers. Reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's a single compound.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the structures. Reaction I's product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which would have two chiral centers (C3 and C5). So, how many stereoisomers are possible?

Wait, the molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The structure is CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3. So, the chiral centers are at C3 and C5. The configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction, and C5 remains as it was (S). So, the product is (S) at C5 and a specific configuration at C3, say R. So, it's a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II's product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is meso. So, it's a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

So, when the products are combined, the total mixture has two different compounds: one from Reaction I (which is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers) and one from Reaction II (a meso compound, which is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, but achiral overall).

Wait, but no, the two products are different compounds, so they don't interfere with each other. So, the combined mixture has two compounds, each of which might have multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, but each reaction produces a single stereoisomer. So, the combined products are two different compounds. Let's think about the structures.

Product I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It's a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Product II: 2,4-pentanediol. It's a meso compound (so, it's a single compound).

So, when they are combined, the mixture has two compounds: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, are these two compounds the same? No, their structures are different. So, in the combined mixture, there are two compounds, each with their own stereoisomerism.

So, now, when running HPLC, how many peaks would each chromatogram show?

The question says, the products are combined and run on both a normal-phase HPLC and a chiral HPLC.

So, first, let's think about the normal-phase HPLC. Normal-phase HPLC separates compounds based on their polarity; it's a non-chiral column. So, if the compounds are not chiral, they will come out as a single peak. If the compounds are chiral, but the column is not chiral, they will come out as a single peak regardless of their stereochemistry because the column doesn't distinguish enantiomers or diastereomers.

But wait, no. If the compound is itself chiral, but the column is normal-phase (not chiral), then the column won't separate enantiomers or diastereomers. So, each enantiomer will come out as a single peak. Wait, no, no. Actually, in normal-phase HPLC, the column doesn't have any chiral selectors, so enantiomers would have the same retention time because the column doesn't differentiate them. Similarly, diastereomers would have different retention times if their physical properties (like polarity) differ.

But in our case, each compound is either a single stereoisomer or a single compound (meso). So, for the normal-phase HPLC:

- Product I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single stereoisomer with two chiral centers) — but wait, how many stereoisomers does it have? It has C3 and C5 as chiral centers. So, possible stereoisomers: 2 (for each center) x 2 (for the other) = 4? Wait, no, wait. The product is a single stereoisomer, so it's either R,R; R,S; S,R; or S,S. But in the reaction, the product is a single stereoisomer, so it's one of these four.

But wait, no, the product is a single compound with a specific configuration. So, in the normal-phase HPLC, each stereoisomer would elute as one peak. But if the product is a single stereoisomer, it will be a single peak.

Similarly, Product II is a meso compound, so it's a single compound, which will elute as a single peak.

So, in the normal-phase HPLC, the two products are two different compounds, each with a single stereoisomer. So, two peaks.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are the two products (from Reaction I and II) structurally similar in a way that their chromatographic behavior is the same? For example, if their polarities are similar, but I don't think that's the case. The first product is a hexan-3-ol with a methoxy group; the second is a pentanediol. So, they are different compounds, so they would have different retention times on HPLC.

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two compounds, each appearing as a single peak because their stereochemistry (if any) isn't affecting the separation. So, two peaks total.

Now, the chiral HPLC column. This column is designed to separate enantiomers. How does it work? Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that interacts differently with enantiomers, causing them to elute at different times.

So, for each compound in the mixture, if it has stereocenters, the chiral HPLC may separate them into their enantiomeric forms. But if the compound is a meso compound, it's achiral and would elute as a single peak.

So, Reaction I's product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers. So, how many stereoisomers does it have? Two chiral centers can lead to four stereoisomers. But in this case, the product is a single stereoisomer, so it's either one of them. So, when run on a chiral column, would it elute as one peak or multiple?

Wait, no. The product is a single stereoisomer, so when run on a chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak. But wait, if the molecule is chiral, the column might cause it to split into multiple peaks if there's any racemic mixture, but in this case, it's a single stereoisomer. So, it would be a single peak.

Wait, but wait a moment. The product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, and is a single stereoisomer. So, it's not a meso compound. So, it's chiral. When run on a chiral column, it would be separated from its enantiomer, but since there's only one present, it would elute as a single peak.

Similarly, Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral. So, on the chiral column, it would elute as a single peak.

So, on the chiral column, there would be two peaks: one from Reaction I (the single stereoisomer, which is chiral) and one from Reaction II (the meso compound, which is achiral).

Wait, but wait another thing. If a compound is chiral but is a single stereoisomer, how does the chiral HPLC affect it? The chiral column can separate enantiomers. If you have only one enantiomer, it would come out as a single peak. So, Reaction I's product would give one peak, and Reaction II's product would give one peak.

So, in total, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks, and the normal-phase would also show two peaks. But wait, looking at the options, none of the options have two peaks in both cases.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, maybe I overlooked that the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers and is a single stereoisomer, but when run on a chiral column, perhaps it's a diastereomer of another form, but no, since it's a single stereoisomer, it's just one peak.

But wait, perhaps I got the number of peaks wrong. Let's think again.

Product I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, so it's chiral). On chiral HPLC, since it's a single enantiomer, it would give one peak.

Product II: 2,4-pentanediol (meso, so achiral). On chiral HPLC, it would give one peak (since it's not chiral).

So, total peaks on chiral HPLC: 2.

On normal-phase HPLC: each product is a single compound, so two peaks.

But looking at the options, option C is 4 and 2. Hmm, no. None of the options have 2 and 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the products.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center. So, the product is a diastereomer with two chiral centers. So, the product is a single stereoisomer (since it's derived from a single enantiomer starting material). So, on normal-phase, it's one peak, on chiral, it's one peak.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → 2,4-pentanediol (meso), so single compound. On normal-phase, one peak. On chiral column, one peak.

So, the combined mixture has two compounds: each giving one peak on both columns. So, normal-phase: 2 peaks. Chiral: 2 peaks.

But looking at the options, none have 2 and 2. Wait, perhaps the products from the two reactions are more than two compounds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis of Reaction I. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent. So, the ketone becomes an alcohol. The resulting molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Now, the starting material is (S) at C5, and the product has a new chiral center at C3. So, the product has two chiral centers, C3 and C5.

But wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. The product from the reduction would have C3 as a new chiral center. So, the product is a diastereomer, but is it a single stereoisomer or a racemic mixture?

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but it's not chiral. So, when reducing a ketone that is not a chiral center, the product would be a racemic mixture of the two possible enantiomers. But wait, if the starting material is a single enantiomer (chiral at another center), would the product be a racemic mixture at the new chiral center?

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. The ketone is at C3, which is not a chiral center. So, the ketone is symmetric—so when it's reduced, the product would be a racemic mixture at C3.

Wait, but in reality, when a ketone is reduced, the product is a secondary alcohol. But the ketone is not chiral, so the product would have two possible enantiomers at C3, but with the configuration influenced by the existing chiral center at C5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. When you reduce a ketone that's part of a chiral molecule, the product would have a new chiral center, but the configuration at that center would be influenced by the existing chiral centers.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about this: the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The molecule is chiral at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced, the product will have a new chiral center at C3. Since the ketone is in a chiral environment (due to C5), the reduction might produce a specific configuration at C3.

But wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces ketones to form secondary alcohols without necessarily creating a racemic mixture. Wait, but the ketone is part of a chiral molecule, so the product would have a specific configuration at C3.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a racemic mixture at C3, but the configuration at C5 remains S. No, that can't be, because the starting material is a single enantiomer. So, the product would have a specific configuration at both C3 and C5.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the product would have a new chiral center at C3, but the configuration is determined by the reduction. Since the reaction is done in a single enantiomer starting material, maybe the product is a single diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture because the reduction creates a new chiral center, but the starting material's configuration doesn't influence it. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think I need to clarify. When a ketone is present in a chiral environment (like in a molecule with other chiral centers), the reduction may not produce a racemic mixture but a specific diastereomer.

Wait, for example, if you have a chiral ketone, like (R)-3-pentanone, and you reduce it with LAH, the product would be (R)-3-pentanol (but wait, that's not possible because the ketone isn't chiral). Wait, another example: (R)-2-pentanone is not possible because 2-pentanone is a planar ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which is a single enantiomer. When you reduce the ketone, the hydride can attack from either face, leading to a 50/50 mixture of R and S at C3. But since the molecule is otherwise chiral (at C5), it could lead to a diastereomeric excess.

Wait, maybe the product is not a racemic mix but a specific diastereomer. Hmm, I'm not certain. But for the sake of moving forward, perhaps Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each with their own configurations at C3 and C5. So, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, so one peak on normal-phase and one on chiral.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of it differently. Let's consider that Reaction I produces a single stereoisomer (because the starting material is a single enantiomer), and Reaction II produces a single compound (meso), so when combined, there are two compounds, each as single stereoisomers.

So, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But looking at the options, there's no option with 2 and 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the number of stereoisomers each product contributes.

Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two chiral centers, so potentially four stereoisomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single diastereomer. So, only one stereoisomer.

Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol. It's a meso compound, so only one stereoisomer.

So, in the combined mixture, there are two stereoisomers, each being a single compound.

Thus, on normal-phase HPLC, each would be a single peak, so two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each would be a single peak, because each is a single stereoisomer, but wait, for the Reaction I product, which has two chiral centers, how does the chiral column affect it? The chiral column can distinguish between enantiomers, but if the molecule is a single stereoisomer, it would just elute as one peak.

So, on chiral HPLC, two peaks: one from each product.

But the options don't have two and two. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer with two chiral centers, but perhaps the product is not a single stereoisomer but a mixture. For example, if the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, while C5 remains S.

So, the product would have two possible configurations at C3, each combined with S at C5. So, two diastereomers: R,S and S,S? No, wait, C3 and C5 are separate.

Wait, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but C5 remains as S. So, for each configuration at C3, there's a corresponding configuration at C5. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, so one stereoisomer.

In any case, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that Reaction I produces a single product with two chiral centers, and Reaction II produces a single meso product.

So, when both are combined, there are two compounds. Each would cause one peak on normal-phase, and one peak on chiral.

But looking at the options, the only option where both columns show two peaks is not present. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

Hmm. None of these have 2 and 2. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the products from both reactions are more than two, leading to more peaks.

Wait, Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has two chiral centers. How many stereoisomers does it have? Four. But the product is a single stereoisomer, so it's one.

Reaction II's product: 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so one stereoisomer.

So, combined, two stereoisomers. On normal-phase HPLC: two peaks. On chiral: two peaks.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm wrong about the number of products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think again. When (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent, it may not just produce the alcohol but perhaps other products, but I think it's just a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces a racemic mixture at C3, while the configuration at C5 remains S. So, the product would be a 50:50 mix of R,S and S,S configurations at C3 and C5.

Wait, no, that can't be because LAH is a strong reducing agent, but when reducing a symmetric ketone, maybe you get a racemic mix. But the starting material is chiral, so perhaps the product is a single diastereomer.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the options again.

Looking at option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase.

How could that happen?

If Reaction I produces two stereoisomers and Reaction II produces one.

But how?

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers. For example, if the reduction leads to two diastereomers.

Wait, if the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture at C3, but the configuration at C5 remains S, then there would be two diastereomers: (R,S) and (S,S) at C3 and C5.

So, the product would be a mixture of two diastereomers, each with equal amounts.

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, each diastereomer would have a different retention time, leading to two peaks.

When run on chiral HPLC, each diastereomer would consist of enantiomers, so each would split into two peaks.

Wait, but wait. If a diastereomer has two enantiomers, then on chiral HPLC, each would elute as two separate peaks.

So, for Reaction I:

If the product is a racemic mixture at C3, then each diastereomer (R,S and S,S) would be present. But wait, no, because the configuration at C5 is S in the starting material. So, perhaps the product is (S,S) and (R,S), each in equal amounts.

Wait, but perhaps the product is (R,S) and (S,R) or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diastereomer with two stereoisomers.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of it this way.

Suppose Reaction I produces a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers (since C5 is S). So, the product is a 50:50 mix of two diastereomers.

Then, Reaction II produces a meso compound (single stereoisomer).

So, when combined, the mixture has three compounds: two from Reaction I (each a diastereomer) and one from Reaction II.

On normal-phase HPLC, each compound is a single peak, so three peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer would split into two enantiomers, so two peaks for Reaction I and one for Reaction II, totaling three peaks.

Wait, but Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral. So, on chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak.

So, total on chiral HPLC: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = 3 peaks.

On normal-phase HPLC: 2 (from Reaction I) + 1 (from Reaction II) = 3 peaks.

But looking at the options, option B is 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase. So this doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces only one product, so two peaks in normal-phase and two in chiral. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the actual structures and their retention times.

Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Assuming it's a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II's product: 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

So, when combined, two compounds.

On normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the reduction in Reaction I leads to more than one product. For example, perhaps the reaction produces a mixture of diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I produces a racemic mixture, leading to two stereoisomers.

Wait, another possibility: the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two chiral centers, but in the reaction, it's a racemic mixture. So, two stereoisomers, which would appear as two separate peaks on normal-phase HPLC.

But in that case, when run on chiral HPLC, each stereoisomer would split into two peaks if they are enantiomers. But if they are diastereomers, they would elute as separate peaks regardless.

Wait, perhaps this is the key. Let me think:

If Reaction I produces two diastereomers (each with two chiral centers), then on normal-phase HPLC, each would have a different retention time, leading to two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer would be a single peak because they are not enantiomers but diastereomers.

Wait, no, chiral columns separate enantiomers, not diastereomers. So, diastereomers would have different retention times on chiral columns as well.

Wait, that's not correct. Chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers would have different physical properties and would be separated on normal HPLC, regardless of the column's chirality.

So, in the case of Reaction I producing two diastereomers, they would each give a peak on normal-phase and on chiral HPLC.

So, Reaction I: two diastereomers.

Reaction II: one meso compound.

So, total in mixture: three compounds.

On normal-phase HPLC: three peaks.

On chiral HPLC: three peaks.

But none of the options have 3 and 3.

Option D says 3 and 3, which would fit this scenario.

But why would Reaction I produce two diastereomers? Because the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When the ketone is reduced, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers.

But I thought the starting material was a single enantiomer, which would influence the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers (each with S at C5 and R or S at C3).

So, in that case, Reaction I would have two diastereomers, and Reaction II would have one compound.

Thus, in total, three compounds. On normal-phase, three peaks. On chiral, three peaks.

Which would correspond to option D.

But maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think about the products again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

If the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, then the product would be a 50:50 mix of (R,S) and (S,S) configurations (if C3 and C5 are the chiral centers).

So, two diastereomers.

Reaction II: meso compound, so one stereoisomer.

Total in mixture: three stereoisomers.

Thus:

Normal-phase HPLC: three peaks.

Chiral HPLC: three peaks.

Which matches option D.

But the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

Wait, option D says 3 peaks in both HPLCs. So, that's possible.

But earlier I thought Reaction II gives one compound, making the total three, but in the initial analysis, I thought Reaction I gives one product.

But perhaps Reaction I gives two products (two diastereomers), and Reaction II gives one, so total three.

So, the answer would be D) 3 and 3.

But why would the initial product be a racemic mix? Because the starting material is a single enantiomer. Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a racemic mixture, but the starting material is chiral elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, leading to two diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer, but the question is about how the products are separated on the columns.

If Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer, and Reaction II's product is a single stereoisomer (meso), then in the combined mixture, two compounds, each appearing as one peak on both columns. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products, and Reaction II produces two products.

No, Reaction II produces a single meso compound.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let's think about the number of chiral centers in each product.

Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol has two chiral centers (C3 and C5). So, potentially four stereoisomers. But the reaction may produce a single stereoisomer or a racemic mixture.

Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol is meso, so two chiral centers but only one stereoisomer.

So, if Reaction I produces a racemic mixture (two stereoisomers), then the combined mixture has three stereoisomers (two from Reaction I, one from Reaction II).

Thus, on normal-phase HPLC: three peaks.

On chiral HPLC: each of the two from Reaction I would be separated into two peaks (enantiomers), but Reaction II's product is a meso compound, so one peak.

Wait, no. On chiral HPLC, the two stereoisomers from Reaction I would each have their own peaks, and the meso product would be one peak. So, total three peaks.

So, the answer would be three peaks in both HPLCs, option D.

Thus, the answer is D.


The problem involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist, followed by analysis of the combined products using normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
The starting material, **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**, is reduced with LAH, a strong reducing agent. LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming **5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. The starting material is chiral at C5, and the reduction introduces a new chiral center at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers (C3 and C5). Thus, Reaction I produces a single compound with two chiral centers.

### Reaction II:
The starting material, **pentane-2,4-dione**, is reduced with NaBH4. This diketone is reduced to **2,4-pentanediol**, which is a meso compound. A meso compound has two chiral centers but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry. Therefore, Reaction II produces a single achiral compound.

### Combined Products:
The products from both reactions are combined:
1. **5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I): A single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.
2. **2,4-pentanediol** (from Reaction II): A meso compound, which is achiral.

### Analysis on HPLC Columns:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:  
   - This column separates compounds based on polarity. Since the two products are structurally distinct (different compounds), they will elute as separate peaks.  
   - Total peaks: **2** (one from each product).

2. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - This column separates enantiomers.  
   - **5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (from Reaction I) is chiral and appears as a single peak because it is a single stereoisomer.  
   - **2,4-pentanediol** (from Reaction II) is achiral (meso compound) and appears as a single peak.  
   - Total peaks: **2** (one from each product).

### Conclusion:
Both HPLC columns produce **2 peaks** in total. However, none of the provided options match this result. Upon re-evaluation, it is possible that Reaction I produces a racemic mixture at C3, leading to two diastereomers, while Reaction II produces a single meso compound. This would result in three compounds in total:
1. Two diastereomers from Reaction I.
2. One meso compound from Reaction II.

### Updated Analysis:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:  
   - The two diastereomers from Reaction I and the meso compound from Reaction II are structurally distinct and will elute as separate peaks.  
   - Total peaks: **3**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:  
   - The two diastereomers from Reaction I are separated into enantiomers, producing two peaks.  
   - The meso compound from Reaction II is achiral and appears as a single peak.  
   - Total peaks: **3**.

Thus, both HPLC columns produce **3 peaks** in total, matching **Option D**.
