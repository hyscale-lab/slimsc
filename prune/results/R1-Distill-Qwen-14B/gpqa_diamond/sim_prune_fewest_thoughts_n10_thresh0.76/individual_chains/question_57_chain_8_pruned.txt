Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored. And I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, but I'm not sure which one it is yet.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula includes a sum over all the angular momentum states l. The formula has a term involving the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m}, but since we're looking along the incident beam direction, φ is probably 0, right? Because the beam is along, say, the z-axis.

Oh right, when the scattering is along the incident direction, the angle θ is 180 degrees if it's backscattering, but wait, no, for the direction of the incident beam, I think θ is 0°. Hmm, but wait, the amplitude along the direction of the incident beam is the same as the forward direction. So maybe θ=0°, but sometimes, depending on conventions, when you're measuring along the beam, it's θ=0. But wait, for the amplitude, the expression is f(0,0) or something like that.

The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is given by a sum over l of (2l+1) * (something) * e^{iδ_l} * (something else). Oh wait, let me think. The formula is f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) f_l (P_l^m (cos θ)) e^{i m φ} }, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, when the incident particle is a spin-½, but maybe the problem is non-relativistic and treating it as spin-0 for simplicity.

Wait, but perhaps another approach: the partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude. The amplitude is given by f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{
