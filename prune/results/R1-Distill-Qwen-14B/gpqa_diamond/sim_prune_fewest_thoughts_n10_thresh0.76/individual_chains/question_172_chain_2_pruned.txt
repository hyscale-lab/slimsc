Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation levels of atoms can tell us about the temperature.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state versus a lower one. So the ratio is n_upper/n_lower.

Wait, I think the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), right? Or wait, sometimes it's written as n_i/n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), assuming E_i > E_j.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that down as ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratio is 2 for star_1. So for star_1, n_upper/n_lower = 2. For star_2, it's n_upper/n_lower = let's say x. Wait, but the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So maybe star_2 has a lower ratio, which would imply a lower temperature.

Wait, no. Let me read again. "Iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So when star_1 has a higher excitation, that suggests a higher temperature because higher temperatures populate higher energy levels more.

So for each star, the ratio is governed by the Boltzmann factor. Let me write the equations.

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ? Or wait, actually, the ratio is higher when the exponent is less negative, meaning higher T. Because as T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio larger.

So for star_1, ratio R1
