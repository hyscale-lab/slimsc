Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop counts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum field theory, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with a note next to it that looks like a size estimate with a bunch of constants and ratios. The string is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And we need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, right, Feynman diagrams and loop counts are related to the order in perturbation theory. Each loop typically contributes a certain factor to the amplitude, and the number of loops can be determined by looking at the overall scaling of the amplitude.

From what I remember, in quantum electrodynamics (QED), each loop brings in a factor of alpha/(2pi), but maybe that's more specific. In general, loop integrals often involve factors of 1/(16 pi^2) per loop because in four dimensions, the loop integral in four dimensions for a Feynman diagram usually has a 1/( (4 pi)^epsilon ) term when you dimensional regularize, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact factors.

Wait, the formula in the note is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let's break this down.

The 1/(4 pi)^6 term catches my eye. Since 4 pi squared is part of the denominator for each loop when you compute loop integrals. Wait, no: each loop contributes a 1/(16 pi^2) factor, which is (4 pi)^2 in denominator—because (4 pi)^2 is 16 pi squared. So for each loop, you get a 1/(4 pi)^2 factor. So if there are L loops, you have (1/(4 pi)^{2L}).

In the given expression, the denominator is (4 pi)^6. So 2L = 6 → L=3. So three loops.

Wait, let me double-check. Each loop gives a factor of 1/(16 pi^2), which is (4 pi)^2. So if you have three loops, that would be (1/(4 pi^2))^
