Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. These are also known as enones or enals, right? The nucleophile, often like an enolate, attacks the beta-carbon, leading to a conjugate addition.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the major products of each.

Let me look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction A:
Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol).

Hmm. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's a diethyl malonate, but wait, no, it's dimethyl. So it's (CH3O)2CCH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. Oh wait, no, I think it's CH2(COO-)2, but with two methyl groups as the esters. So it's methyl groups on the two carboxylic acid groups. So the structure is CH2(CO2Me)2, right? That makes it a good enolate donor because the central CH2 is susceptible to deprotonation, generating an enolate which can attack.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but with the E configuration. Wait, no, wait: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, right? So the structure is CH2=CH-C( p-tolyl ) ester? Or wait, wait. Let me think: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH- C(=O)OCH3, with a p-tolyl group attached to the acrylate. No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula for methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOMe. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, that seems confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)prop-2-enoate. So the structure would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C( p-tolyl )-COOCH3, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's the substituent on the double bond. Let me think: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have a double bond between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl group on C3
