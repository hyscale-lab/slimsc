Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem has two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to find out the major products for each. Then, I'll match them to the options given. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different possibilities for A and B.

First, let's look at Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, potassium hydride (KH), and then H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a common solvent, especially in Grignard reactions. Potassium hydride is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something here.

Wait, the compound is a spiro alcohol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom—the oxygen in this case. The structure is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached to the spiro center. The formula is spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol, which I think means it's a nonane with two rings: one 3-membered and one 5-membered, connected at the 1-position. The double bond is at position 5.

When I think about the reaction conditions, THF with a strong base like KH, I'm guessing it's a deprotonation. Where would the acidic proton be here? Alcohols are somewhat acidic, but in the presence of a strong base like KH, maybe the -OH proton gets abstracted. So the hydroxyl group becomes an oxide, O-.

Once deprotonated, the base (KH) would form an alkoxide. Then, when H+ is added, perhaps it's a workup step. But wait, sometimes when you have an alkoxide, especially in a ring system, it can undergo elimination if there's a possibility for forming a double bond or a ring expansion.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material already has a double bond. Could it be that the alkoxide is undergoing some kind of elimination reaction, leading to ring formation? Because that's a common thing in spiro compounds under basic conditions. They can form bicyclic structures through elimination.

So, if the alcohol is deprotonated to an alkoxide, and then elimination occurs, perhaps forming a new ring. Let me think about the structure. The spiro center is at position 1, with a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂). If the alkoxide leaves as a good leaving group (but wait, O- is not a good leaving group unless protonated), maybe I'm missing something. Or perhaps it's more of a base-induced elimination without a leaving group, like E2.

Alternatively, considering that the starting compound has a spiro structure, upon deprotonation, could it form an enolate, which then undergoes some kind of cyclization? Or perhaps the base induces a ring-opening or ring-closing.

Wait, another approach: the structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro is at the 1-position, with a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring. The alcohol is
