Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different acetates: Cis-butenyl, Trans-butenyl, Cis-propenyl, and Trans-propenyl.

Let's look at the NMR data given:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm, so I remember that in NMR, the integration tells me the number of protons. So, 1H in each of the first two signals, and 3H in the others. The acetate group is probably the OAc part, which typically has a singlet around 2.1 ppm. That matches the 2.1 ppm peak, which is a singlet (s), so that's the acetoxy group.

Now, looking at the other signals. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16 Hz. That's a large coupling, so I'm thinking this is probably a trans coupling in a double bond. Because in double bonds, the protons are often split by adjacent protons, especially in alkenes. So if it's a doublet, maybe it's a vinyl proton.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). Wait, no, wait, the notation is (dq), which I think stands for doublet of doublets. No, wait, actually, the notation is that the letters represent the splitting. So, for example, a doublet of doublets would be written as dd. Hmm, but here it's written as dq. Oh wait, maybe it's a doublet with more splits, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, it could be a doublet of quartets or something else. Hmm. Or perhaps the 'q' stands for quartet, but in combination with a doublet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The 5.5 ppm is probably part of the alkene protons. Since the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16, which is a large coupling, perhaps those are the trans protons on a double bond. So maybe it's a trans double bond.

Wait, but in a double bond, the two protons on each carbon are usually split into a doublet, unless there are substituents. Oh, but wait, let's consider the structure of the compounds given.

The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let me think about their structures.

Propenyl acetate would have a three-carbon chain attached to the ester. So, the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc or something like that. Wait, but propenyl is CH₂=CH₂- maybe? Wait, no, propenyl would be CH₂=CHCH2-OAc? Or perhaps CH₂CH₂CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, no, I think I should think in more detail. Let me try to draw the structures.

Cis-propenyl acetate would be where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the two CH₂ groups are on the same side. No, wait, propenyl is CH₂=CHCH2- group. So propenyl acetate would be CH₂=CHCH₂OAc. But wait, that's not exactly right. Wait, the structure is CH₂CH₂OAc connected where? No, wait, the correct structure is OAc-O-CH₂CH₂CH₂? No, no. Wait, acetates are R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, acetate is OAc as in O-CO-O- attached to R. So, for propenyl acetate, it would be CH₂=CHCH₂-OAc.

Wait, but butenyl
