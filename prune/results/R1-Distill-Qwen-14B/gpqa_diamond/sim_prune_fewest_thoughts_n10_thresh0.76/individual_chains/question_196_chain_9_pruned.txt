Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a mass attached to a spring, and it oscillates with simple harmonic motion. But this is a relativistic version, so things are probably different because of the speed approaching the speed of light.

The problem states that the oscillator is 1-dimensional, with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the classical case (non-relativistic), the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² ⇒ v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so we can't use that formula directly.

Relativistically, things get more complicated because as speed increases, the relativistic effects come into play. The energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (which includes both kinetic and potential) should be conserved. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, but in the relativistic case, the potential energy might also be affected. Wait, but wait—Hooke's law is F = -kx. So the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², right? Or maybe not, because relativistically, forces and energies might be treated differently. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure here.

Wait, typically, in relativistic mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, it's (γ - 1)mc². So the total energy is the sum of the potential and the relativistic kinetic energy.

At maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is at rest (minimum kinetic energy, maximum potential). So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, wait again. No, because in the non-relativistic case, the potential at x=A is (1/2)kA², and kinetic is zero. So the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA².

But in the relativistic case, when x=A, the speed is zero, so kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc² = (1-1)mc² = 0. So the total energy is indeed (1/2)kA². But wait, wait, because when x is not zero, the velocity is not zero. So perhaps the energy is the sum of the potential and the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, another approach: the total energy in the harmonic oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential. At any point, E
