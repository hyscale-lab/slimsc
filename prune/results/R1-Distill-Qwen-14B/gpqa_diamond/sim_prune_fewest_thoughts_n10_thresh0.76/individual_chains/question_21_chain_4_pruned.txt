Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Then it asks about two compounds: which doesn't show tautomerism (A) and among two other compounds, which shows optical isomerism (B). The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B.

First, let me break down the two parts of the question.

Part A: Which of benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism?

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

I need to figure out A and B for each option.

Starting with Part A.

What's tautomerism? Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift between different tautomeric forms, usually through the movement of a hydrogen atom and the rearrangement of double bonds. This often involves the keto-enol tautomerism in carbonyl compounds.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, specifically it's 1,4-benzoquinone. Quinones generally have conjugated carbonyl groups. Do they undergo tautomerism? Well, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. Wait, but quinones are usually in a conjugated structure, so their tautomerism is... Hmm, wait, I think that quinones can sometimes exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. Or do they not because the structure is already conjugated and less likely to undergo such shifts?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Benzoquinone has a structure with two carbonyl groups. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl or something that can shift. In benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is on the benzene ring. Are there any hydrogens alpha to the carbonyl? Let me visualize the structure. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=C=O. So, each oxygen is attached to a benzene carbon, and each of those carbons is double-bonded to oxygen. Are there any hydrogens adjacent to those carbonyl groups? The benzene ring is conjugated, but each of the carbons where the O is attached (positions 1 and 4) have two other benzene carbons attached. So, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. Are they CH groups? Wait, no. In the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone, each of the carbons with the double bond to O is connected to two benzene carbons. So, the structure is O=C6H4=C=O. Wait, that's not correct. Benzene quinone has two ketone groups. So the structure is O=C6H4-C=O, but wait, no. The correct structure is benzene with two ketone groups in the 1 and 4 positions. So each of those carbons is double-bonded to O, and the ring is conjugated
