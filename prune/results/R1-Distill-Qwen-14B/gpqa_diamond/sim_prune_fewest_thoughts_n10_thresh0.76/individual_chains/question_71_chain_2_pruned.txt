Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method, but I think that's just about how they were discovered and probably not relevant to the actual calculation here. The key point is that we're dealing with planets in resonance with these specific orbital period ratios.

The question is asking about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. The options are given as A to D, but I'll get to those later.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from its star. Since all these planets are in a system with the same star, the main factor here will be their orbital distances. Also, the question states they have the same albedo, so albedo isn't a varying factor; it cancels out in the ratio.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/2) ), but since the albedo is the same for all, and assuming circular orbits (so e=0), the formula simplifies to T ∝ sqrt(R_star/(2a)), but since R_star and other factors are the same for all planets, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star).

Wait, no, wait. Another way to think about it: the equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_eff * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. But since the star is the same for all, L is constant, so T is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(0.5). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of a.

So, T ∝ 1 / sqrt(a). So if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, I can find the ratio of their temperatures, but since T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), the temperature ratio will be sqrt(a2/a4).

Wait, let me get that straight. If Planet_2 has period P2 and Planet_4 has P4, then their distances a are related by Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit, a³ ∝ P². So a = k * P^(2/3), where k is some constant for the system.

So the ratio a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Then the temperature ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( (a2/a4) ) = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me double-check that. Let's write it step by step.

Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = constant, so a ∝ P^(2/3).

So a4 = k * P4^(2/3), a2 = k * P2^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Then, T is invers
