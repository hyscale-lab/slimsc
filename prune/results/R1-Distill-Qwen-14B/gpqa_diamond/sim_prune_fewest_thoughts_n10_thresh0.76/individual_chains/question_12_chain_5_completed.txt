Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Let me think through this step by step. 

The problem states that a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The given rest masses are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. They want the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D with different values.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to maintain zero total momentum.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Mass of Pi(+) (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²
- Mass of mu(+) (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²
- Neutrino is nearly massless, so m_nu ≈ 0.

Wait, neutrinos have very small but non-zero mass, but in many problems, especially at the level of this question, they are treated as massless for simplicity. That makes things a bit easier.

So, the decay is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the neutrino is massless, its energy would just be equal to its momentum times c (but in units where c=1, it's E = p).

But let's think about conservation of energy and momentum.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c². In units where c=1, E_initial = m_pi = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. So E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation says the total momentum before is zero, so the momenta of mu and nu must be equal and opposite. Let me denote the magnitude of the momentum as p. So, p_mu = p, p_nu = p, but in opposite directions.

Now, the energy of each particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Again, since we're using c=1 units, this simplifies to E² = p² + m².

So for the muon: E_mu² = p² + m_mu²
And for the neutrino: E_nu² = p² + (m_nu)^2. Since m_nu is zero, E_nu = p.

So let's write the energy equation:

m_pi = E_mu + E_nu
Substitute E_nu = p: m_pi = E_mu + p.

But from the muon's energy equation, E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

So substituting E_mu into the energy equation:

m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

Let me solve for p. Let me rearrange the equation:

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + m_mu² = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side:

p² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging to solve for p:

2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So,

p = (m_pi² - m_mu²) / (2 m_pi).

Let me compute this.

Calculating numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Wait, to compute that, I can use the difference of squares: (a^2 - b^2) = (a-b)(a+b).

So,

(139.6 -105.7) = 33.9 MeV

(139.6 +105.7) = 245.3 MeV

So 33.9 * 245.3 = let's compute that.

Hmm,

33 * 245 = 33 *200=6600, 33*45=1485. So 6600 +1485=8085.

Wait, but more accurately:

33.9 * 245.3.

Let me compute 33.9 * 245.3.

33.9 * 200 = 6780.

33.9 * 45 = let's see, 33.9*40=1356, 33.9*5=169.5 → total 1525.5.

33.9 *0.3 = 10.17.

Wait, no, wait: 245.3 is 200 +45 + 0.3.

Wait, let me compute each part:

33.9 * 200 = 6780.

33.9 *45 = ?

33.9 *40 = 1356.

33.9 *5 = 169.5.

So 1356 +169.5 = 1525.5.

33.9 *0.3 = 10.17.

So total is 6780 +1525.5 = 8305.5 +10.17=8315.67 MeV².

So the numerator is 8315.67 MeV².

Denominator is 2 * m_pi = 2 *139.6= 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376.

But 8376 is larger than 8315.67, so it's a bit less than 30.

Compute 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Wait, maybe a better approach: 279.2 * x =8315.67.

x ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

I can approximate:

279.2 is about 280.

8315.67 / 280 ≈ ?

280 *29=8120.

8315.67-8120=195.67.

280 *0.7=196.

So 29.7, since 280 *29.7=8120 +195.6=8315.6. Exactly. So x ≈29.7.

Wait, but 280 is larger than 279.2, so the actual x would be a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should do the division precisely.

Alternatively, 8315.67 /279.2 ≈ let me compute 8315.67 /279.2:

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 8.31567 / 0.2792.

0.2792 ×29.7 ≈ 8.31564 (since 0.2792 *30=8.376; 0.2792*0.3=0.08376. So 0.2792*(30-0.3)=8.376-0.08376=8.29224. Wait, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 279.2 *29.7:

279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

279.2 *0.7=195.44.

So 8096.8 +195.44=8292.24.

But our numerator is 8315.67, so 8292.24 is less than that.

Difference is 8315.67 -8292.24=23.43.

Now, to find how much more to add to 29.7 to reach 23.43.

Each 0.1 adds 27.92 (since 279.2 *0.1=27.92).

So 23.43 /27.92 ≈0.84.

So 0.84 *0.1=0.084.

So p ≈29.7 + 0.084=29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact value, but perhaps an approximate value is sufficient for this step.

So p ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Now, knowing p, we can find E_mu and E_nu.

E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so m_mu^2 = (105.7)^2.

Compute 105^2=11025, 0.7^2=0.49, and cross terms 2*105*0.7=147.

So (105.7)^2 = (105 +0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 +0.7² = 11025 +147 +0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So E_mu² = p² + m_mu² = (29.78)^2 + 11172.49.

Calculate 29.78^2: Approximately 29^2=841, 0.78^2=0.6084, 2*29*0.78=44.04. So 841 +44.04=885.04 +0.6084=885.6484. So p² ≈885.65 MeV².

E_mu²=885.65 +11172.49=12058.14.

E_mu= sqrt(12058.14) ≈109.8 MeV.

Wait, but the mass of muon is 105.7, so the energy is a bit higher, as expected.

Wait, 105.7^2 is 11172, so 109.8^2 is 12058. So that's correct.

So the total energy of the muon is about 109.8 MeV, and the neutrino has 29.78 MeV.

Now, the kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy.

So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu*c².

Since m_mu is 105.7 MeV, KE_mu = 109.8 -105.7 =4.1 MeV.

And KE_nu = E_nu, since its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu =29.78 MeV.

Wait, but checking the options:

Looking at option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's close to our calculation.

Wait, let me redo the p calculation more accurately.

Compute p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2)/(2 m_pi).

m_pi = 139.6, m_mu=105.7.

m_pi^2 = 139.6^2 = (140 -0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 +0.4^2 =19600 -112 +0.16=19488.16.

m_mu^2=105.7^2=11172.49.

So m_pi^2 -m_mu^2 =19488.16 -11172.49=8315.67.

2 m_pi=2*139.6=279.2.

So p=8315.67 / 279.2.

Compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this division.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

279.2 * 0.8=223.36.

So 279.2 *29.8=8096.8 + (279.2 *0.8) =8096.8 +223.36=8320.16.

Wait, that's larger than 8315.67.

So 29.8 gives us 8320.16, which is 4.49 MeV higher than 8315.67.

So let me see how much less than 29.8 is needed.

Each 0.01 decrease in the multiplier would subtract 279.2 *0.01=2.792 from 8320.16.

We have 4.49 to subtract, so 4.49 / 2.792 ≈1.607.

So subtract 0.01607 from 29.8 → 29.78393.

So p≈29.78393 MeV/c.

So E_nu = p =29.7839 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²)= sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.7839^2: let me compute it.

(29.78)^2 = (30 -0.22)^2 =900 - 2*30*0.22 +0.0484=900-13.2 +0.0484=886.8484.

Wait, but wait: 29.78 ≈29.78, so p=29.78393.

So p^2 = (approx) (29.78)^2 ≈886.8484.

Wait, but perhaps a more precise calculation would be better.

But for the sake of the problem, perhaps 29.78 MeV.

So E_mu^2 = (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Which is (886.8484) + (11172.49) =12059.3384.

So E_mu = sqrt(12059.3384) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

E_nu is 29.78 MeV, so its KE is 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for p.

Alternative approach: Compute p = (m_pi² - m_mu² ) / (2 m_pi ) = (139.6² -105.7²)/(2 *139.6).

Compute numerator:139.6^2 = 19488.16, 105.7^2=11172.49 → 19488.16-11172.49=8315.67.

Denominator:2*139.6=279.2.

8315.67 /279.2 = let me compute this.

Let me set this up as 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

We can compute how many times 279.2 fits into 8315.67.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

Now, 279.2 * 0.78 = ?

0.7 *279.2=195.44.

0.08 *279.2=22.336.

So 0.78 *279.2=195.44 +22.336=217.776.

Which is very close to 218.87.

So 279.2 * 0.78 =217.776.

So the remainder is 218.87 -217.776=1.094.

So 29.78 gives 8096.8 +217.776=8314.576 → 8315.67-8314.576=1.094.

So 29.78 gives 8314.576, with a remainder of 1.094.

So to find how much more we need beyond 29.78 to cover the remaining 1.094.

Each 0.01 in x adds 279.2 *0.01=2.792 to the product.

We have 1.094 left, so 1.094 /2.792 ≈0.392.

So 0.392 of 0.01 is 0.00392.

So x=29.78 +0.00392≈29.78392.

So p≈29.7839 MeV/c.

E_nu=29.7839 MeV.

E_mu= sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) → let's compute this accurately.

29.7839^2 = (29.78)^2 + (0.0039)^2 + 2*29.78*0.0039.

Wait, alternatively, compute 29.7839 *29.7839.

But maybe it's easier to use the exact calculation.

But perhaps it's sufficient to proceed with the approximation.

So E_mu= sqrt( (29.7839)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) → Let me compute 29.7839^2.

29.7839^2 = (30 -0.2161)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.2161 + (0.2161)^2.

=900 - 12.966 + 0.0467 ≈900 -12.966=887.034 +0.0467=887.0807.

So 29.7839^2≈887.0807.

Plus 105.7^2=11172.49 → sum is 887.0807 +11172.49=12059.5707.

So E_mu= sqrt(12059.5707)= approximately 109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu=109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

E_nu=29.7839 MeV → KE_nu=29.78 MeV.

So the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

That's very close. So I think the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary π⁺ pion into a μ⁺ muon and a neutrino. The rest masses are given as:

- \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \),
- \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \),
- \( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \) (treated as massless).

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, \( E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
   \]
   Since the neutrino is massless, \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} \), where \( p_{\nu} \) is its momentum.

2. **Momentum Conservation**: The pion is initially at rest, so the total momentum after decay must be zero. This implies the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:  
   \[
   p_{\mu^+} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
The energy of each particle is given by the relativistic energy-momentum relation:
\[
E^2 = p^2 + m^2.
\]
For the muon:
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]
For the neutrino:
\[
E_{\nu}^2 = p^2 + m_{\nu}^2 = p^2.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \( p \)
From energy conservation:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu}.
\]
Substituting \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p \), we get:
\[
m_{\pi^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p.
\]
Rearranging and squaring both sides:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = m_{\pi^+} - p,
\]
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = (m_{\pi^+} - p)^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p + p^2,
\]
\[
m_{\mu^+}^2 = m_{\pi^+}^2 - 2 m_{\pi^+} p.
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
2 m_{\pi^+} p = m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2,
\]
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi^+}^2 - m_{\mu^+}^2}{2 m_{\pi^+}}.
\]

### Substituting Values
- \( m_{\pi^+}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2 \),
- \( m_{\mu^+}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2 \),
- \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \).

\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Energy of the Muon and Neutrino
1. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon Energy**:  
   \[
   E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]
   - \( p^2 = 29.78^2 \approx 887.08 \, \text{MeV}^2 \),
   - \( m_{\mu^+}^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2 \),
   - \( E_{\mu^+}^2 = 887.08 + 11172.49 = 12059.57 \, \text{MeV}^2 \),
   - \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{12059.57} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}. \)

### Kinetic Energy
1. **Muon Kinetic Energy**:  
   \[
   KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino Kinetic Energy**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy is its kinetic energy:  
   \[
   KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options:

- **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \) matches closely.

ANSWER: D
