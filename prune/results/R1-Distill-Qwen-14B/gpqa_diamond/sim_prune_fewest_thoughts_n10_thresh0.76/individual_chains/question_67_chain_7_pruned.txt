Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the setup is about two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l equal to 1. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, where l1 and l2 are the individual quantum numbers, l is the total orbital angular momentum, and m is its z-component. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We're asked to find the joint probability that both measurements yield eigenvalues of -ħ.

Hmm. So, each Lz is the z-component of the angular momentum. For a single particle in an l=1 state, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ, right? Because m can be -1, 0, +1 when multiplied by ħ.

But wait, the state given is a coupled state for the two electrons. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the m is -1. 

I remember that when dealing with coupled angular momenta, the states are eigenstates of the total angular momentum squared (L²) and its z-component (Lz). But for each individual particle's Lz, it's a bit different. The individual L1z and L2z operators don't commute with the total Lz, right? Or with each other because they're for different particles. So the state given might not be an eigenstate of L1z and L2z. 

Wait, but the question is asking about the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. So we're looking for the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both are -ħ. 

So, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is specified. I think I need to express this state in terms of the product states of the individual angular momenta. Each product state would be a tensor product of |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>, so |m1> and |m2> are the individual z-components for each electron. 

The total
