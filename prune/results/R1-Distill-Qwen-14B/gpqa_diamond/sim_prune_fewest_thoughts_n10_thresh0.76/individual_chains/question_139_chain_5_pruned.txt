Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

First, I remember that sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and HCl are typically used in the formation of diazonium salts, especially with aromatic amines. But wait, in this case, the products are diketones. Hmm, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Oh wait, another possibility is the Beckmann rearrangement, which involves the reaction of oximes with certain conditions to form ketones. But wait, oximes are usually treated with acid, like HCl, and maybe something else, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening here.

Wait, another thought: when amines react with nitrous acid (like from NaNO2 and HCl), they form diazonium salts. But if the amine is part of a ring, like a cyclohexylamine, under certain conditions, such as treatment with H2O, it can undergo hydrolysis. Oh, right! Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like the Sandmeyer reaction, but without copper, perhaps a hydrolysis reaction would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, when a primary aromatic amine is converted to a diazonium salt and then hydrolyzed, it can form a carbonyl group. But that's for aryl diazonium salts. For aliphatic amines, especially primary ones, the diazonium salt tends to undergo different reactions. Oh, right! For aliphatic primary amines, the diazonium salt might decompose to form a nitro compound, but under certain conditions, maybe it can form a ketone or aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the Stephen reduction or some kind of cyclization. Wait, no, I'm probably mixing things up. Let me think again. If the starting material is a secondary alcohol, then treating with HCl and NaNO2... Wait, no, secondary alcohols don't react with nitrous acid in the same way as amines. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the compounds A and B are undergoing a reaction that converts them
