Okay, so I have this question about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, let's see what the problem says. The chemist found a white solid with certain spectra. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one fits the data.

The given data includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR. Let's go through each piece one by one.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at 158 (32%). The molecular ion is usually the molecular weight plus a proton, right? So if the molecular ion is 156, the molecular weight is probably 155. But wait, the options might have different molecular weights. Let me check.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but with substituents. Let's calculate. The formula would be C7H5ClO2 (since there's a hydroxyl and a Cl and a formyl group). Wait, molecular weight: C (12*7)=84, Cl ~35.5, O2=32, H5=5. So 84+35.5=119.5+32=151.5 +5=156.5. So molecular weight around 156.5. So the molecular ion at 156 would fit. But the M+2 peak is at 158 (32%). For Cl, the M+2 peak is usually 32% because of the natural abundance of chlorine's isotopes (about 32% for 35Cl). So this makes sense because the molecular ion is at 156 (M), and the M+2 is 158. So that fits with a Cl being present. So option A is a possibility.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. With a Cl substituent, so formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12*7=84, Cl=35.5, O=32, H=5. So 84+35.5=119.5+32=151.5+5=156.5. Same as option A. So molecular ion 156, M+2 at 158 is also correct here.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be ClCO-O-phenyl? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2ClCO? Wait, wait, no. Let me think. Chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So R is phenyl, so the formula is C6H5O2Cl plus CO? Wait, no. Wait, chloroformate is O=C(Cl)O-Ph. So the formula
