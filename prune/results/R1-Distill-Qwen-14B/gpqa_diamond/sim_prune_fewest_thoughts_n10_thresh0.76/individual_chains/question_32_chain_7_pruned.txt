Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one. 

First, I should figure out what this nucleus X is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. The standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. But if X has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

So the mass of the nucleus is important here. I'll need the mass of Li-6. I remember the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Let me calculate the total mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total mass m = (3 * m_p) + (3 * m_n). Let me plug in the numbers. m_p is approximately 938.272 MeV/c² and m_n is about 939.565 MeV/c². 

Calculating each part: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV, and 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV. Adding them together gives 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV. Oh wait, that's 5.633511 GeV. So the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus is about 5.6335 GeV/c².

Now, the problem is about the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy is given by gamma times m c squared. So E = gamma * m c².

But gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Since v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma. The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v=0.96c.

So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 * 3.5714 is around 1, right? 0.28 *3.5 is 0.98, and 0.28 *0.0714 is about 0.02, so total around 1. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me calculate it more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm,
