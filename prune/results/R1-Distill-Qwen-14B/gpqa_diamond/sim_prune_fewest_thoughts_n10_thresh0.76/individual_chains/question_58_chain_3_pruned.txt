Okay, so I've got this physics question here about which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. The idea is to introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then take the cutoff to infinity in a controlled way. But wait, which theories actually need this regularization?

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each theory's behavior at high energies. Regularization is needed when the theory has divergences, especially when loops are involved. So, theories that don't have these issues wouldn't need regularization.

Starting with Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), which is option C. I remember that QED is a quantum field theory that has been very successful. But when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy or the vertex correction, you get divergent integrals. These divergences are handled by renormalization, which involves counterterms. But before renormalization, you might use regularization methods like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization. So QED does require regularization.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with the gauge group SU(3). At high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free, meaning the coupling constant decreases, and the theory behaves more like a free theory. But wait, it's still a quantum field theory, so loop diagrams can have divergences. So you would need regularization and renormalization in QCD too. I think they even use techniques like lattice regularization sometimes. So QCD requires regularization.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version. In classical E&M, you don't have the same kind of divergences as in quantum theories because it's not a quantum field theory. For example, in Maxwell's equations, you can have point charges, but the theory doesn't inherently require regularization because it doesn't deal with the same loop divergences. So classical theories probably don't need regularization since regularization is a quantum thing. So D might be the correct answer because it's classical and doesn't have the same divergences that quantum theories have.

Option A is Superstring
