Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. Let me read through it again.

The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Wait, but wait a secondâ€”when we're talking about wave functions in quantum mechanics, they need to be normalized. Oh right, because the probability of finding the particle somewhere must add up to 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But the problem says that when they measured the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So maybe this part is valid only between x=1 and x=3? Or perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the given expression is for the part where it's non-zero.

Wait, actually, the question says "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So I think the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero outside. That makes sense because when they measured, particles were found only between 1 and 3.

So the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and
