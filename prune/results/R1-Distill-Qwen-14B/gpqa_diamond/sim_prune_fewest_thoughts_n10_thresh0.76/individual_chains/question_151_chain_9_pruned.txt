Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I've studied a bit about observables and states, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that means the state vector is a column vector, I guess. Let me write that down.

State vector Ψ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Wait, but wait—does that mean it's a 3x1 column matrix? Yeah, because the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. Right.

The observable P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So the matrix P looks like:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I think. So, the observable is a matrix, and to find the probability of measuring a certain eigenvalue, I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is 0, then find the corresponding eigenvector. Then compute the probability by taking the inner product of the state vector Ψ with the eigenvector.

Wait, but wait—another approach. Alternatively, maybe P is a projection operator, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the expectation value, but the question is about the probability of measuring 0.

Wait, let me think again. The observable P is a Hermitian matrix because it's an observable. So its eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis. So, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P.

So, the first step is to find the eigenvalues of matrix P. Because the question is about the probability of getting 0 when measuring P.

So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's set up the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues λ are found by det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let me write down P - λ I:

[
[-λ, 1/√2
