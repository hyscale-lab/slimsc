Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

So the question is about some chemical reactions and mixtures. Let me break down what I know.

First, there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Wait, what does that mean? I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double bonds. So, the liquids in X probably have unsaturated bonds like alkenes or something similar. But the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. Oh, so each molecule in X has a single double bond, not conjugated, like maybe an alkene.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, it undergoes a reaction. The result is mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. This mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y's liquids don't have double bonds because bromine water wouldn't react. Wait, but how did they get from double bonds to no double bonds? Oh, maybe hydrogenation. Platinum is a catalyst for hydrogenation, which adds hydrogen across double bonds.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says the reaction is a disproportionation. Disproportionation means a single species is both oxidized and reduced. Hmm, so maybe one of the reactants is getting hydrogenated, but how? Oh wait, maybe it's not hydrogenation but something else. Or perhaps one of the components in X is undergoing a reaction that breaks it into two different compounds in Y. Let me think.

Wait, but the problem also says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only one substance Z. Oh, so if you hydrogenate X and Y, you end up with the same hydrocarbon Z. That suggests that both X and Y decompose into the same product when fully hydrogenated. So maybe the components of X and Y are related via hydrogenation.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, and Y is another mixture of two liquids. When either X or Y is hydrogenated, it gives only Z. So perhaps each component of X, when hydrogenated, gives a component of Y, and vice versa? Or maybe more accurately, the hydrogenation of X's components gives the same Z, and the same for Y.

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think again. If X is a mixture of two unsaturated compounds, and Y is their hydrogenated products. But in the case of Y, it's a mixture of two other liquids, perhaps with more hydrogen.

Wait, but when you hydrogenate X, you would get Y? Because X has double bonds, which upon hydrogenation would become single bonds. But no, because the problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So maybe each component of X and Y, when hydrogenated, gives Z. So X contains two components that when hydrogenated become two components in Y. Wait, no, that's not matching. Because if X and Y are hydrogenated to the same Z, then X and Y must have components which upon hydrogenation become Z.

Wait, maybe X has two alkenes, and Y has the same two alkenes but with some groups changed. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the last part. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Let's calculate its molecular formula. The mass of hydrogen is 14.28% of the molecule. So, hydrogen contributes 14.28%, which is 14.28/100 = 0.1428.

Hydrogen's molar mass is 1, so the number of H atoms is 0.1428 * molar mass. Let me denote the molecular formula of Z as CnH2m. The molar mass would be 12n + 2m.

The mass fraction of H is (2m) * 1 / (12n + 2m) ) = 0.1428.

So, 2m / (12n + 2m) = 0.1428.

Let me solve for m in terms of n. Let's multiply both sides by denominator:

2m = 0.1428 (12n + 2m)
2m = (0.1428 * 12n) + (0.1428 * 2m)
2m - 0.2856 m = 1.7136n
1.7144 m = 1.7136n → approximately m ≈ n.

Hmm, because 1.7144 is approximately 1.7136, that's very close. So m ≈ n. Let me test m = n.

If m = n, then the formula is CnH2n. Let's see what that gives for the mass fraction.

Hydrogen mass fraction = 2n *1 / (12n + 2n) = 2n/(14n) = 1/7 ≈0.142857, which is exactly 14.2857%. So yes, that's correct. So Z is of the form CnH2n. So possible candidates are alkanes? Wait, no, because alkanes have H2n+2. Wait, no, wait: wait a second, CnH2n is an alkene? No, wait, alkenes have H2n. So wait, for a molecule with formula CnH2n, that's an alkene. But wait, in the problem, Z is a hydrocarbon obtained by hydrogenation. So if Z is an alkene, but when you hydrogenate it, you get an alkane. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no. Wait, the hydrogenation process adds hydrogen across double bonds. So if Z is CnH2n+2, that's an alkane. Because when you hydrogenate an alkene (which is CnH2n), you get an alkane (CnH2n+2).

Wait, but the problem says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must already be fully saturated. So Z is an alkane, which makes sense. So Z's formula is CnH2n+2.

Earlier calculation: the mass fraction of H is 14.28%. So for Z, which is CnH2n+2, let's compute.

Hydrogen mass fraction = (2n + 2) * 1 / (12n + 2n + 2) ) = (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 14.28% = 0.1428.

Let me set up the equation:

(2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides:

2n + 2 = 0.1428 * (14n + 2)
2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856

Wait, let me compute 0.1428 * (14n +2):

0.1428 * 14n = 2n (because 0.1428 is approximately 1/7, and 14n *1/7=2n)
0.142
