Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator is a standard problem in quantum mechanics.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. I think I need to find both values and match them with the options given.

First, let's recall what I know about the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. The energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each dimension. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so the energy depends on the sum of the individual quantum numbers.

Wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels for the isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, sometimes I see it written as E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the total quantum number, which is the sum of the three individual quantum numbers. So, n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

But wait, no. Wait, I think that's for the 3D case where each direction contributes. So the energy levels are degenerate, meaning multiple states share the same energy. The energy depends on the total number of quanta in all three directions.

So, the ground state has n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. The first excited state would be where one of them is 1, others zero. But that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, because the state with (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) are all different states but have the same energy. So their energy would be E = (1 + 0 + 0 + 3/2) ħω? Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, I think the formula is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). So for the ground state, n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, so E = (3/2) ħω. That's the ground state.

The first excited state would be the states where the sum is 1. So n_x + n_y + n_z =1. So possible states are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). These are three distinct states, so the degeneracy is 3.

The second excited state would be when n_x + n_y + n_z =2. The degeneracy is higher. How many? Let's think: the number of ways to write 2 as the sum of three non-negative integers. The possible combinations are:

(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2): each of these gives 3 states.

(1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1): each of these gives 3*2=
