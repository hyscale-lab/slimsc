Okay, so I've got this question here about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says my colleague has a Feynman diagram and some notes next to it. The note says "size estimate" and then a string of constants and ratios. The symbols are alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I'm supposed to figure out how many loops the diagram had.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams are used to represent interactions, and loops in these diagrams correspond to higher-order processes. Each loop generally adds a factor of some sort. Wait, I think each loop contributes a factor of 1/(16π²) or something like that because of the integration over loop momentum. Or maybe it's related to the number of loops and the power of π?

Wait, the note has a term (4π)^6 in the denominator. Let me think about the dimensional analysis or the typical factors that come from loop integrals. Loop integrals often involve integrals over d^4k, and when you do a loop integral, you might end up with factors of 4π from the volume of the sphere (the integration in spherical coordinates), but the exact factor can depend on the specifics.

Wait, each loop typically contributes a factor of (1/(16π²)) in four dimensions because the integral in d^4k leads to 1/( (4π)^2 ) for each loop, but wait, maybe more. Let me think: in 4 dimensions, a loop integral, after some Wick rotation, becomes an integral over d^4k, which after dimensional analysis, might give a factor of (1/( (4π)^2 )) per loop. But wait, sometimes people use different conventions, like including factors of sqrt, or 8π², etc.

Alternatively, I remember that in dimensional regularization, the loop integrals in four dimensions can lead to factors involving 1/(4π)^2. But the exact power depends on the number of loops. For example, a one-loop diagram would have (1/(4π)^2) raised to the number of loops, or something like that.

Looking at the given expression: there's a term 1/(4π)^6. So, the denominator is (4π)^
