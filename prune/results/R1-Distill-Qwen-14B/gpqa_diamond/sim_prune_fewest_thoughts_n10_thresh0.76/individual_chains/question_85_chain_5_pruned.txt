Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that factor cancels out. That makes things a bit easier.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = T_star * ( (L_star / (16 * pi^2 * sigma * D^2 )) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think it's T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ), but I'm not sure. Or wait, perhaps another approach: the equilibrium temperature is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The star emits energy, and the planet absorbs a part of it, then radiates as a blackbody. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ), where 'a' is the planet's orbital distance from the star. Oh, but wait, that's under the assumption that the planet's distance is much larger than the star's size, which should be the case here.

Wait, but another approach is the inverse square law. The flux from
