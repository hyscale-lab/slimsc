Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, no, actually, the way it's written might be a bit confusing. Oh, right, matrices are usually written as rows or columns, but the state vector here is a column vector. So the state vector |ψ> is a 3x1 matrix. Let me write that out. So the vector ψ is:

ψ = [ -1 ]
        [ 2 ]
        [ 1 ]

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? So the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1. Let me check that. The components are -1, 2, and 1. Squaring each gives 1, 4, and 1. Adding them up: 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh wait, that's 6, which is way bigger than 1. So ψ isn't normalized. Hmm, but in the problem statement, it just gives the state as that vector. So I guess I should proceed with it as given, but perhaps I'll need to normalize it later on.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). Let me write that down:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

Wait, I should check if P is a Hermitian matrix because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me see. The diagonal elements are 0 in all cases. The element at (1,2) is 1/√2, and the (2,1) element is also 1/√2. For the (1,3) and (3,1) elements, both are 0.
