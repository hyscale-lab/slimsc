Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and decay modes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that's a typo in the way it's written. Oh, wait, it's probably something like L = -λ ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, no, the original expression is written as -λ f bar psi f (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, maybe the correct interaction term is something like λ ψ_f^† (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), indicating that X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the boson X interacts with fermions via this term. That suggests that X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair. So the possible decay products are any fermions for which this interaction is allowed.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than X's mass. Because in particle decays, the rest mass of the parent must be greater than the sum of the daughter particles' rest masses.

So I need to figure out which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let me list the possible fermions and their masses.

Wait, but I need to know the masses of the fermions. Let's recall:

- Up quark (u): about 2 MeV
- Down quark (d): about 4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron (e): negligible, ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: even lighter, but since they're leptons, but the problem probably doesn't include them because the interaction term is for ψ_f, which might be quarks or charged leptons.

Wait, the interaction is given by the term involving ψ_f. So ψ_f could be any fermion, including quarks and leptons. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the total mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So let's list the possible pairs:

Each decay is X → f f̄.

For each fermion f, the mass of f (m_f) must be less than or equal to X's mass/2, because each f and f̄ contribute m_f. So m_f ≤ 6 GeV /2 = 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses below 3 GeV?

Looking at the masses:

- e: 0.5 MeV → yes
- μ: ~105 MeV → yes
- τ: ~1.78 GeV → yes (since 1.78 <3)
- u: ~2 MeV → yes
- d: ~4-5 MeV → yes
- s: ~100 MeV → yes
- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes
- b: ~4.5 GeV → wait, 4.5 is more than 3 GeV? Oh wait, no, 4.5 is the mass of the b quark. But X is 6 GeV. So if X decays into b b̄, the sum would be 4.5 *2 =9 GeV, which is more than 6. So that's impossible.

So fermions with mass m_f where 2 m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So any fermion with m_f ≤3 GeV can be produced.

So looking at each:

e: yes, since 0.5 MeV <<3 GeV.

μ: 105 MeV < 3 GeV → yes.

τ: 1.78 GeV <3 → yes.

u: 2 MeV <3 → yes.

d: 4-5 MeV → wait, 4 MeV is 0.004 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. Wait, wait a second, 4 MeV is 0.004 GeV. Wait, no, 4 MeV is 0.004 GeV, which is way less than 3 GeV. So wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 4 MeV is 0.004 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So d quark can be produced.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the masses:

Quark masses (current masses, approximate):

u: ~2 MeV
d: ~4-5 MeV → 0.004-0.005 GeV
s: ~100 MeV → 0.1 GeV
c: ~1.5 GeV
b: ~4.5 GeV
t: ~173 GeV

Leptons:

e: ~0.5 MeV
μ: ~105.7 MeV → 0.1057 GeV
τ: ~1.78 GeV

So for m_f:

- e: 0.0005 GeV → yes
- μ: 0.1057 GeV → yes
- τ: 1.78 GeV → yes
- u: 0.002 GeV → yes
- d: 0.004 GeV → yes
- s: 0.1 GeV → yes
- c: 1.5 GeV → yes
- b: 4.5 GeV → 4.5*2=9 GeV >6 → can't decay to b b̄.

So X can decay to any of these fermion pairs where m_f ≤3 GeV.

So possible decay channels are:

uū, dđ, sī, cī, τ+τ-, and the charged leptons e+e- and μ+μ-.

Wait, but wait, the interaction term is -λ ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So does this imply that X couples to all fermions, including both quarks and leptons?

Yes, because ψ_f could be any fermion field. So X can decay into any of these pairs.

So the possible decays are:

uū, dđ, sī, cī, τ+τ-, e+e-, μ+μ-.

Wait, but wait, does the coupling include all quark flavors?

Yes, because the Lagrangian doesn't specify any particular flavor, so X can decay into any quark-antiquark pair where the mass allows.
