Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound given is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, wait, I'm not entirely sure what that structure is. Oh, wait, benzene rings numbered 1 and 2. So, position 1 has a bromine, and position 2 has a deuterium (d)? Or is it that the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2, with bromine and something else? Wait, no, the formula is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, maybe it's bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2? Or is it a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2? That makes sense. So the benzene has Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, right? So numbering would be consecutive. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the substituents are next to each other.

The reaction is treatment with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Or wait, in aromatic substitution, maybe for eliminating HX from a benzylic position? Or perhaps it's a case of aromatic nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, benzene derivatives typically undergo substitution reactions. In aromatic substitution, conditions usually matter
