Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and determining its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. So, it's like a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position. I'm a bit fuzzy on how that works. I remember that the space of density matrices is a convex set, and for a single qubit, the state space is a 3-dimensional space, right? Because a qubit is a 2-level system, so the density matrix has 4 elements, but due to trace 1 and Hermiticity, it's 3-dimensional.

Density matrices can be represented as points in a 3D space using the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, any single-qubit state can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (like a radius) pointing from the origin to the surface of a unit sphere.

So let me think. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere, and |1><1| has 1 at (2,2). Adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then multiplying by 1/2, we get a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. So ρ is:

[0.5 0]
[0 0.5]

Wait, that's the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5. Because I is [[1,0],[0,1]],
