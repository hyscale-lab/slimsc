Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Hmm, let me think this through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out the chemical formula from the options provided: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The absorption peak at around 3000 cm^-1 is very broad. I remember that broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak around 3000 could also be from an alcohol (like an -OH group) or maybe an amide, but I don't think amides are in the options here. So maybe an -OH group is present.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are in the regions for carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a strong carbonyl, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, perhaps an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone, or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an amide, but again, I don't see an amide in the formula options.

Wait, but if there are two carbonyl peaks, that suggests the presence of two different types of carbonyl groups. Oh, or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group that absorbs near that region. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else like an aromatic ring or an amine. Hmm, but 1650 is more likely to be a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups. But wait, thinking againâ€”could it be a conjugated system, like a conjugated diene or something else?

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 could be a ketone, and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretch). But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an ester or an aldehyde? No, aldehyde's carbonyl is usually around 1700-1720, I think. So maybe it's an ester? Or perhaps an acid.

Wait, but if the 1700 is a carbonyl, maybe it's part of an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring, but if the compound doesn't have an aromatic ring, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: The 1700 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which tends to have a lower wavenumber than a regular carbonyl. So if the 1700 is the carbonyl, maybe the 1650 is
