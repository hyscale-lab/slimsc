Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, observed from a laboratory frame. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. The index of refraction is n, and we need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, especially involving light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's just classical addition of velocities? Or does relativity affect this?

Wait, no, wait. The speed of light in a medium is different from its speed in a vacuum. In a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the glass is moving relative to the lab frame. So how does that affect the speed of light within it?

Wait, but the question is specifically about the speed of light in the glass from the lab's perspective. Let me think. If the glass is moving, does that influence the speed of light inside it? Or does the speed depend only on the medium's properties, regardless of its motion?

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that change things from the lab's frame?

I think
