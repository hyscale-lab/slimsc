Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember from my studies that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are two main types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional differ in the bonding arrangement, while stereoisomers have the same bonding but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The problem has two parts, A and B. Let me take them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism.

Wait, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a electron pair between adjacent atoms, resulting in different tautomers. Common examples are ketones and aldehydes undergoing tautomerism, like in the case of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and others. Alternatively, I think that's more keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a cyclic diketone, right? So structures with two ketone groups in a ring. Wait, but wait, does benzoquinone have any groups that can tautomerize? Let me think. Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, so two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. But wait, the benzene ring is conjugated, so maybe the structure can't easily tautomerize because the rings are already stable. Or wait, maybe it can undergo some kind of keto-enol tautomerism? Or perhaps not, because the positions might be too rigid.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So it's a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1,3,5. This compound. For tautomerism to occur, there should be adjacent atoms that can shift a hydrogen. Wait, but each of the ketone groups is on a separate carbon. Let me imagine the structure. Each ketone is at every other carbon. So the ring has three carbonyl groups. So each of those carbonyls is on adjacent carbons
