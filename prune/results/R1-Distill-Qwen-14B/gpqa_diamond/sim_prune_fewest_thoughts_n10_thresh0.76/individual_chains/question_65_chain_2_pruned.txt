Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to pick the correct major products from the options given. Let's look at each reaction separately.

Starting with reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, potassium hydride (KH), and then an acid. Hmm, wait, THF is a solvent, right? And KH is a strong base. So what kind of reaction conditions are we looking at here?

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which is the spiro center. In this case, the molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The structure has a spiro ring with a vinyl group attached. So, the rings are connected at the first carbon, which is also where the vinyl group is. The alcohol is at that same carbon.

When you have an alcohol treated with a strong base like KH, I think about elimination reactions, like the E2 mechanism. But wait, the base is also in THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. So maybe this is an elimination to form a ketone or some kind of ring expansion.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have an alcohol and a strong base, it can deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, perhaps an elimination occurs. Alternatively, if there's a possibility for forming a more stable carbocation, maybe some kind of carbocation rearrangement happens. But the presence of a base suggests an elimination is more likely.

Wait, but the starting alcohol is at a spiro center. So imagine the structure: it's a spiro ring with two rings, maybe a 3-membered and 5-membered ring? The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro carbon. So the structure is something like:

       O
       |
CH2-CH2-C-OH (spiro)
 \    /
  ... 

Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. The spiro rings are fused at the 1-position, which has the vinyl group and the hydroxyl. So, the structure is a bit complex
