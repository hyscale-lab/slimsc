Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let me break this down step by step.

The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, the molecular formula tells me it's a small organic molecule. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, wait, the formula is: Degree of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X (halogens) is 0, so it becomes (2*9 +2 -11 +1)/2. Let's compute that: 20-11=9, plus 1 is 10. 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3, because a benzene has 3 double bonds) plus two more, maybe a double bond and a ring, or maybe two double bonds. Or perhaps an ester group (which has a double bond) and a benzene ring.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches, maybe from an amide or amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But given the molecular formula and the other data, I think it's more likely an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: This is probably a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a triplet. Like an ethyl group (CH2CH3), where the methyl is next to a CH2. Because in ethyl groups, the CH2 next to the oxygen would have neighboring protons that split the CH2CH3 into a triplet.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: Hmm, a broad singlet suggests maybe an NH group, but wait, 2H? Or perhaps an OCH2 group. Wait, in an ester, the OCH2 would be around 4.0-4.5. But a singlet for 2H would mean no neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's the NH being split into a broad peak, but if it's a singlet, that's a bit confusing because NH protons usually are broad but maybe in a specific environment.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group. For example, if we have an ethyl group, like OCH2CH2CH3, but that would have a triplet at 1.20 (the CH3), and a quartet at 4.0 for the CH2 next to O. Wait, but the quartet would be at around 4.0, but in the given data, 4.0 is a singlet. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something.

Wait, let me look again. The NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: that's likely the CH3 in an ethyl group (OCH2CH3?), but wait, OCH2CH3 would have the CH2 at around 4.0-4.5 as a quartet. But the 4.0 ppm here is a singlet, which is 2H. Hmm, perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom but not split, maybe as part of a ring or something else.

Then, 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: that's a quartet, which typically comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. For example, the OCH2 in an ethyl ester would be split into a quartet by the adjacent CH2 (like in CH2CH3). So if the ethyl is attached to an oxygen, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.5 ppm, and the CH3 would be a triplet around 1.20. So that fits with an ethyl group, like OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, the ethyl is OCH2CH3. Oh wait, the splitting: the OCH2 would be next to the CH3, which has 3H. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (since each proton in OCH2 would split into 4 peaks due to the 3 neighboring H from CH3). So a quartet at 4.5 ppm would be OCH2CH3. But wait, in that case, the 4.0 ppm would perhaps be something else.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, 2H. Maybe it's an NH group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 that's not split because it's adjacent to something else. Like if it's part of an aromatic ring or something.

Looking further, there's 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Those are typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest two protons each, and they're in a para arrangement. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split into doublets when there are two adjacent protons on the ortho positions. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me think. For a para-substituted benzene, the substituent is on the para position. The protons adjacent to the substituent would be in the ortho positions. Wait, perhaps for a substituent like OCH2CH3, the ring would have two sets of protons: the ortho and para to the substituent. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an amino group or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets, each with 2H. So perhaps the aromatic ring has two substituents. Or maybe it's a meta substitution, but that would give a different splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's causing splitting into two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzamide, where the NH is split into a doublet.

Wait, let me think about the structure of each option.

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide where the ethoxy is at position 3. Benzamide has the structure PhCONH2. But if it's 3-ethoxy, then the substituents are at 3 and maybe the amide is at position 1 (para) or somewhere else. Wait, no, benzamide is PhCONH2, and substituents would be in the meta or para positions. Wait, in 3-ethoxybenzamide, the ethoxy is at position 3, and the amide is at position 1. So the benzene ring has substituents at 1 and 3, which would be meta to each other. That would lead to some coupling between the aromatic protons.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: Formamide is HCONR2; here, the substituent is 4-ethoxyphenyl attached to the formamide. So structure is O=C(N-Ph-OEt)H. The phenyl group is attached to the formamide, and the ethoxy is para on the phenyl. So the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern, leading to two doublets in the NMR.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. The structure would be PhNH2 with a propionyl group. So, something like CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph? Wait, no. Wait, propionic acid ester would be CH2CH2COOR. Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute each option.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: Structure is CH2CH2O-CO-PhNH2, I think. So the benzoate ester is O-CO-PhNH2, with the ethyl ester.

Wait, the molecular formula of each option:

Assuming all options have the formula C9H11NO2.

Let me check:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide: Benzamide is C7H7NO2 (PhCONH2). With an ethoxy substitution, replacing a H, so the formula would be C9H9NO3? Wait, wait, no, wait: benzamide is C7H7NO2. An ethoxy group is OCH2CH3, which adds 2 carbons, so the compound would be C7 + C2 = C9, and H: 7 (from benzamide) minus 1 (replaced by OEt) plus (5 from OEt) → 7-1=6 +5=11. So C9H11NO3? Wait, but the original formula is C9H11NO2. So that would imply that Option A has formula C9H11NO3, which doesn't match. So perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, maybe I should compute each option's molecular formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would replace a hydrogen on the benzene. So the formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9, H: 7 -1 + (5 from ethoxy) → 7-1=6 +5=11. O: 2 (from benzamide) +1 (from ethoxy) = 3. N: 1. So formula is C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So Option A is off by one oxygen. So it's not option A.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. Here, N is attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the structure is HCON(PhOEt). Let's compute the formula.

Ph is C6H5. OEt is OCH2CH3. So the phenyl group has 6 C, and the OEt adds 2 C. So the substituent is C6H4OCH2CH3 (4-ethoxyphenyl). So the formamide would be HCON(C6H4OCH2CH3). Formula: 

HCON(PhOEt) → H, C=O, N, and the substituent.

So C: 1 (from HCO) + 6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) = 9.
H: Let's see. The formamide is HCONR: H from HCO is 1. The phenyl group is C6H5 (but in the substituent, it's C6H4OCH2CH3 → so 4 H on the ring? Wait, wait, the substituent is 4-ethoxyphenyl, which is C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the phenyl has 4 H (since one H is replaced by OEt and another by the N- attachment). Wait, perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Alternatively, let's count:

Formamide: HCONR2 → in this case, R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the substituent is C6H4-OCH2CH3. So each R is C7H7O (since 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H4-OCH2CH3 → 6+2=8 C, but wait, 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H4-O-C2H5 → so 6+2=8 C, but that's part of the R group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's compute each component.

Formamide is HCONR2. Each R is C7H7O (since 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H5-OCH2CH3 → no, wait, 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H4-OCH2CH3. So each R is C7H7O? Or more accurately, the group is C6H4OCH2CH3, which has 6 (C6) + 2 (OCH2CH3) = 8 C, but that's part of the R group. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is better computed as:

Formamide (HCONR2) → H, C=O, N, and two R groups.

Each R is 4-ethoxyphenyl group, which is C6H4-OCH2CH3.

So each R: C6H4OCH2CH3 → 6 C (benzene) + 2 C (ethoxy) = 8 C, 7 H (benzene has 4 H if para substituted), but wait, the benzene in 4-ethoxyphenyl has a substituent at para, so the structure is C6H4-OCH2CH3. So the number of H is 4 (since two substituents: OCH2CH3 and the attachment to N). So each R is C8H7O.

Wait, maybe I should just compute the molecular formula of each option.

Let me try that.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 at position 3 and the amide (CONH2) at position 1. So benzene (C6H5), minus two H (for the two substituents), plus OCH2CH3 and CONH2.

Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group would replace a H, so the formula would be C7 + C2 (from OCH2CH3) = C9, H: 7 -1 (replaced by ethoxy) + (5 from OCH2CH3) → 7-1=6, 6+5=11. O: 2 (from benzamide) +1 (ethoxy) =3. N:1. So formula is C9H11NO3. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A is out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → structure is HCON(PhOEt). So the formamide is HCONR2, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl.

Each R is 4-ethoxyphenyl: C6H4-OCH2CH3. So each R contributes C8H7O.

Wait, but the formula for formamide would be HCONR2 → so (CH2O)N(R)2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the formula as:

Formamide is HCONR2. R is 4-ethoxyphenyl.

Each R is C8H7O (C6H4-OCH2CH3 → 6+2=8 C, H: 4 (from benzene) + 5 (from OCH2CH3) → 9 H? Wait, no, because when the ethoxy is attached to benzene, the benzene has 4 H (para substitution). Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the entire formula.

HCON(PhOEt) → H, C=O, N, and two 4-ethoxyphenyl groups.

Each 4-ethoxyphenyl is C6H5OCH2CH3 → which is C8H9O. So the entire molecule would be HCON(C8H9O)2? No, wait, formamide is HCONR2, so R is 4-ethoxyphenyl, which is C8H9O. So the formula would be: H (1) + C (from HCON) → C from HCON is 1. Each R is C8H9O, so two R would add 2*(8 C, 9 H, 1 O) = 16 C, 18 H, 2 O. So overall:

H: 1 (from HCO) + 18 (from R groups) = 19 H. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2.

Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, formamide is HCONR2. So if R is 4-ethoxyphenyl (C8H7O), then the formula would be:

H (1) + C (from HCONR2: 1 (HCO) + 2*(8) from R) → 1 + 16 =17 C? No, that can't be right because the given formula is C9. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is:

Formamide is HCONR2. R is 4-ethoxyphenyl (C6H4-OCH2CH3). So R is C8 H7 O. So the molecule would be HCON(C8H7O)2 → HCON(C8H7O)2. Let's compute the formula:

H: 1 (HCO) + 2*(7 H from each R) → 1 +14 =15 H. C: 1 (HCO) + 2*(8 C) → 1 +16=17 C. O: 1 (HCO) + 2*(1 O from each R) → 1+2=3 O. N:1. So the formula is C17H15NO3, which is way larger than the given C9H11NO2. So that can't be right. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be (PhNH2)COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2 attached to the propionate via the amino group. So it's PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Or is it PhNH2 attached to the carbonyl as in PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps it's PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps the structure is PhNH2COO-R, where R is ethyl or something else.

Wait, the correct structure for 4-aminophenyl propionate would be the propionate ester of 4-aminophenol. Wait, no, 4-aminophenyl propionate would imply the amino group is attached to the benzene ring, and the propionate is attached as the ester. So the structure would be PhNH2COO-R, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's the amino group attached to the benzene ring, and the propionate is an ester group. So the structure would be O=C-O-CH2CH2CH2 attached to the benzene ring, and the amino group is at the para position.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2COO-PhNH2. Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's PhNH2 attached to a propionate ester. So the full formula would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that would have more carbons. Let me compute the molecular formula.

Ph is C6H5. NH2 is one group. COOCH2CH2CH3 is the propionate ester. So the formula would be:

C:6 (Ph) + 1 (NH2) + 3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) → 6 +3=9. H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) + 7 (CH2CH2CH3) → 5+2=7 +7=14? But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So if I'm getting C9, which matches. But H? Let me recount.

PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3: Ph (5 H?), NH2 (2 H?), COOCH2CH2CH3 (7 H?).

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the structure is PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3, which would be an amide, not a propionate. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid with ethanol, but wait, that would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure for option C is PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be:

Ph → C6H5, NH2 → 1N, 2H, COO → 2O, CH2CH2CH3 → 3 C, 7H. So total:

C:6 (Ph) +3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) → 9 C. H:5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +7 (CH2CH2CH3) → 14 H. O: 2 (COO) +1 (O from ester linkage) → but wait, the ester is O, so maybe 3 O? But the given formula is O2, so this can't be right. So the formula would be C9H14NO3, which doesn't match the given C9H11NO2. So option C is out.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is ethyl ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. So the structure is PhNH2COOCH2CH3.

Let me compute the formula:

Ph (C6H5) + NH2 (C0H2N) + COOCH2CH3 (C3H5O2).

Wait, the benzoate ester would be O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring. But the amino group is at the para position.

So the formula would be:

C6 (Ph) + 1 (COO-) + 2 (CH2CH3) → total C: 6 +2=8? Wait, no. Let me recount.

Ph is C6H5.

COOCH2CH3 is (COO-) attached to CH2CH3. So the benzoate ester is C7H5O2 (C6H5COOCH2CH3?), wait no, wait, benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. Its ethyl ester is C6H5COOCH2CH3. So the formula is C8H8O2. But since it's 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is at the para position, so the molecule is C6H4(NH2)COOCH2CH3. So the formula would be:

C:6 (Ph) + 3 (COOCH2CH3 → 1 from COO, 2 from CH2CH3) → 6+3=9.

H: The Ph group (C6H4-) has 4 H (since it's para-substituted with NH2 and COOEt). The NH2 has 2 H. The COOEt group has (CH2CH3 has 7 H? No, wait, CH2CH3 is 2 C, 7 H? No, CH2CH3 is 3 H on CH3 and 2 H on CH2, total 5 H. Plus the NH2 has 2 H. So total H: 4 (Ph) +2 (NH2) +5 (CH2CH3) = 11. O: 2 (from COO) and 1 (from O in the ester linkage) → but wait, the ester is O, so COOCH2CH3 has two O. So O: 2 (from COO) and the O in the ester is part of the same group. So total O is 2. So the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches the given formula.

So option D has the correct formula.

Now, let's look at the spectroscopic data.

IR: 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are medium to strong bands. These are likely N-H stretches. If the compound has an amine group, like NH2, which is a primary amine, the IR would show broad peaks around 3300-3500. So in option D, there's a NH2 group.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. In an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1740 cm-1. So that fits with option D being an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H → likely the CH3 of an ethyl group. In ethyl esters, the CH3 is a triplet because it's next to a CH2. So this fits with ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H → Hmm, this is a bit tricky. In an ethyl ester, the OCH2 group is typically around 4.2-4.3 as a quartet. But here, it's at 4.0 as a singlet. Wait, maybe it's a different group. Alternatively, perhaps this is the NH2 group, but NH protons usually are broad but not singlets unless in a specific environment, like if they're de-shielded but not split much. But in option D, the NH2 is on the benzene ring attached to the COOEt group. Wait, but the NH2 in a para-substituted benzamide would be in a different environment.

Wait, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is O=C-O-CH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, with NH2 at the para position. So the NH2 would be on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons would typically show up as a broad signal, but in the NMR data, we have 4.0 ppm as a singlet (2H). That doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the N-H is not present because the compound is a secondary amide, but wait, in option D, it's an amine, so the NH2 would be present.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the NMR data again.

In the NMR, besides the aromatic protons, we have:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): Ethyl CH3.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Maybe the OCH2 from the ethyl ester, but I thought that would be a quartet around 4.2-4.3.

Wait, but in some cases, if the OCH2 is split into a quartet, but in the data, it's a singlet. That's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 protons. But NH2 protons are usually around 1-5 ppm, but more often in the 2-5 range, but broad. A singlet for 2H would suggest no neighboring protons. Alternatively, maybe it's an NCH2 group, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another point: the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) in the NMR. In an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm. But here, it's at 4.5 and a quartet. Could this be the OCH2 group?

Wait, if the OCH2 is at 4.5 as a quartet, that would fit an ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3, and the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2. Then, what's the 4.0 ppm singlet? Maybe the NH2 protons are at 4.0, but that seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an OCH2 group, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the splitting. If the OCH2 is next to the CH3, it would be a quartet (n+1, where n=3). So in the NMR, the OCH2 would be a quartet with integration 2H. So in the data, 4.5 ppm is a quartet (2H), which matches the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3, which is correct.

Then, the 4.0 ppm singlet (2H) must be something else. Wait, but in option D, the NH2 is para to the COOEt group. So the NH2 would be part of the benzene ring. The NH2 protons would typically show as a broad peak, perhaps around 2-5 ppm, but in this case, it's a singlet at 4.0. That doesn't fit. Unless the NH2 is not present? Wait, but option D has NH2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the NMR data.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet (2H). If it's not the NH2, what else could it be? Maybe an OCH2 group that's not split because it's coupled to something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom that's not split. Or maybe it's a different group.

Wait, another possibility: the structure might involve an acetamide or similar. Let me think about the IR again. The strong absorption at 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester. So option D is an ester, which makes sense.

Looking at the aromatic protons in the NMR:

7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted benzene. The lower field shift (8.0 ppm) is likely due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the COOEt group, causing the para protons to deshield and appear downfield. The NH2 group is at the para position to the COOEt, so the protons adjacent to the NH2 would be ortho to it. Wait, but in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the protons adjacent (ortho) would be on either side, and the meta would be the other two positions.

Wait, in 4-aminobenzoate, the COOEt is at position 1, and the NH2 is at position 4. So the benzene ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. The protons in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to the NH2, and positions 3 and 5 would be meta to the NH2 and ortho to the COOEt.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw the structure mentally.

Ph–COOEt at position 1, and NH2 at position 4. So the substituents are para to each other. The aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to each substituent.

The protons ortho to the COOEt (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear downfield, while the protons ortho to the NH2 (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded and appear upfield.

Wait, but in the NMR, the downfield peak is at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and the upfield is at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H). So the two doublets suggest that there are two sets of two protons each. For a para-substituted benzene, the ortho and para protons would split into different doublets.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, making it para, and the aromatic protons are at positions 2,3,5,6.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the coupling. Each set of doublets would have J around 8-9 Hz, typical for para-substituted rings.

So the aromatic protons in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the NMR data.

Now, what about the 4.0 ppm singlet (2H)? Let me think about any other groups. In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ethyl group's OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.3 ppm, but in the data, it's at 4.5 as a quartet. So that fits. The CH3 is at 1.20 as a triplet, which also fits.

So the 4.0 ppm singlet (2H) must be something else. Wait, perhaps it's the NH protons. But in an amine, the NH2 would typically show as a broad peak, perhaps as a singlet if there's no splitting. But would it be at 4.0 ppm?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not an amine but an amide. Wait, option D is an amine, but if the structure were an amide, like ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, wait no, that's an ester.

Wait, another thought: maybe the NH2 is not present. No, the molecular formula has one N, so it must be either an amine or amide.

Wait, in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H. If it's not the NH2, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the NMR analysis. Let me think again.

In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is PhNH2COOEt. The NH2 is para to the COOEt. The ethyl ester would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2 ppm. So those match the NMR data.

The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. The H ortho to COOEt (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, appearing around 8.0 ppm, and the H ortho to NH2 (positions 3 and 5) would be less deshielded, appearing around 7.0 ppm. That matches the data.

But what about the 4.0 ppm singlet (2H)? There's an inconsistency here. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is another group. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Its structure is HCON(PhOEt). The formamide has an HCON group attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl.

In this case, the ethoxy would be on the benzene ring, and the formamide group would be attached at the para position.

The formamide group is HCONR2, so the R is PhOEt. So the structure would be HCON(PhOEt) → but wait, that's not possible because formamide is HCONR2, which would require two R groups attached to N. So perhaps it's HCON-(PhOEt) where the N is attached to the phenyl group. Wait, that would make it N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

In that case, the structure would be HCO-NR where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formamide has one substituent on N, which would make it HCONR, but that's not correct because formamide is HCONR2. So both R groups would be 4-ethoxyphenyl. But that would be a bit strange, but possible.

In that case, the NMR would have the ethoxy group's CH3 as a triplet, and the OCH2 as a quartet. The formamide's carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1, matching the IR.

The aromatic protons would be para to the ethoxy group. So the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, similar to the given data. The N-H in formamide would be around 8-9 ppm, but the data shows the 4.0 ppm as a singlet, which may not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH proton in formamide. But formamide typically has a broad peak around 8-9 ppm for the NH. So that might not fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to go back to the options and the data.

The given NMR has:

- 1.20 ppm triplet, 3H → ethyl CH3.

- 4.0 ppm, singlet, 2H → ?

- 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H → OCH2 of ethyl ester.

- 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, each d, 2H → aromatic.

So the ethyl ester part fits with options D and perhaps B.

In option D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the ring, and the ester is attached at the para position.

But the 4.0 ppm singlet is a problem because I can't find where it comes from.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an OCH2 group. Wait, but that's conflicting with the quartet at 4.5.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from an NH group, but that doesn't fit the expected shifts.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the NMR analysis. Let me think about the ethyl ester's OCH2. Typically, OCH2CH3 in an ethyl ester would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1 ppm and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2 ppm. So the data shows the OCH2 at 4.5 as a quartet, which is a bit upfield, but possible.

Then, the 4.0 ppm singlet must be something else. Maybe it's the NH2 protons, but they are usually broad. Alternatively, perhaps the compound isn't D but another option.

Wait, let's think about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure is HCON(PhOEt). So the formamide has the structure H-C(=O)-N-(PhOEt). The ethoxy is at the para position of the phenyl group attached to N.

So in the NMR, the ethoxy group's CH3 would be a triplet at 1.20 ppm, and the OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1 ppm. The formamide's N-H would be a broad peak, perhaps around 8-9 ppm. But the given NMR doesn't show a peak that high, except for the aromatic protons.

Wait, but the 4.0 ppm singlet (2H) could be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the phenyl group's protons, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the singlet is from the NH group. But in formamide, the NH would be a broad peak, perhaps as a singlet. But in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which seems too upfield for an NH.

Hmm, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, another approach: look for the number of signals in the NMR.

The given NMR has four signals: triplet (3H), singlet (2H), quartet (2H), and two doublets (each 2H). So total of 3+2+2+2+2=11 H. Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has 11 H. So the integration matches.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

In this structure, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H. The ethyl group would have triplet (CH3) and quartet (OCH2). But where does the 4.0 ppm singlet (2H) come from? There's no other H in the structure except the NH2. But the NH2 would be a broad signal, possibly around 2-5 ppm, but not a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not showing up in the NMR because it's exchanging and not splitting, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the singlet at 4.0 ppm is from the NH2 group, but it's a singlet because the two H are equivalent and not split due to exchange or other reasons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis, and the correct answer is option B.

Wait, in option B, the structure is HCON(PhOEt). So the formamide would have the HCO group attached to N, which is attached to the 4-ethoxyphenyl.

The NMR would show:

- The ethoxy's CH3 as triplet at 1.20 ppm.

- The OCH2 of ethoxy as quartet at around 4.1 ppm.

- The formamide's N-H would be a broad peak, perhaps at 8-9 ppm.

But the given NMR doesn't show a peak around 8-9 ppm. So that might not fit.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the IR again.

The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester (C=O stretch). So options D and B are possible.

But looking back, option D's structure would have an ester group, so IR makes sense. The NMR data for the ethyl ester fits, but the 4.0 ppm singlet is unclear.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the NH2 group, but in D, the NH2 is on the ring. The NH2 protons would typically be around 1-5 ppm, broad. If the NH2 is not deprotonated, it would show as a broad peak, possibly as a singlet if the two H are equivalent and not split. But the data shows a singlet at 4.0 ppm. Could that be the NH2?

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from an OCH2 group, but I thought that would be a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2, and the singlet at 4.0 is from another group, like an NCH2 group. But in option D, there's no NCH2; the N is part of NH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the formamide's NH, but that doesn't fit the integration.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for another approach.

Looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The NMR would have:

- Ethyl group: triplet at 1.20 (CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2).

- Aromatic protons: two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm (2H each).

- NH2 protons: a broad peak, possibly around 4.0 ppm as a singlet.

So the singlet at 4.0 ppm could be the NH2.

But in reality, the NH2 protons in aminobenzoate esters are typically broad and might appear as a singlet if they're not split. So the 4.0 ppm singlet could be the NH2.

Thus, all the NMR data would fit option D.

So, putting it all together:

IR: strong C=O at 1720 (ester).

NMR:

- 1.20 (t, 3H): ethyl CH3.

- 4.5 (q, 2H): OCH2.

- 4.0 (s, 2H): NH2.

- Aromatic doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.

So the correct answer is option D.


The compound has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, which corresponds to a degree of unsaturation of 5. This suggests the presence of a benzene ring (3 degrees of unsaturation) and additional unsaturation likely from a carbonyl group. The IR spectrum shows strong absorption bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹**, consistent with N-H stretches, and a strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**, indicating a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

The **¹H NMR data** is as follows:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a CH₃ group in an ethyl group (CH₃CH₂).
