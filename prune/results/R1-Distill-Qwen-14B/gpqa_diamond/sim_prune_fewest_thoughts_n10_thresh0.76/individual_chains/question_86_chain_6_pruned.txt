Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the products are enantiomers of each other because their configurations are R and S.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, right? So, the product is a tetrahydropyran ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. The configurations are R and S, which means that each product is a different enantiomer of the same compound. So, these are mirror images of each other.

The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents. But wait, BH3 is typically used in the form of BH3·THF or something, right? Because BH3 itself is a gas. But in any case, both are boron-based reducing agents, often used for ketones, but wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones and aldehydes. Wait, but wait, in this context, maybe they're reducing esters or something else.

Wait, but wait a second. LiBH4 can reduce esters under certain conditions, perhaps. Let's think about that. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are carbonyl-containing compounds that, upon reduction, form the cyclic ketone.

Hmm. The product is a tetrahydropyran, which is a six-membered ring with oxygen, like a cyclic ether. So, the product must come from a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar? Or perhaps from a cyclic ketone via some kind of ring-opening and re-closing.

Wait, no. Wait, when you reduce a ketone, you get a secondary alcohol. So, but the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, maybe the
