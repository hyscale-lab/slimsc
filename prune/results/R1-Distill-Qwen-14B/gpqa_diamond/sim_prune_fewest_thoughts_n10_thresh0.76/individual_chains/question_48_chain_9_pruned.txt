Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine to form product 1. Wait, what reaction does bromine do to ketones? Oh right, I think it's the haloform reaction. But wait, the haloform reaction is when a methyl ketone is treated with X2 (like Br2) in the presence of a base, leading to the formation of a carboxylic acid (or its salt) and a haloform (like CH3Br). But cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketoneâ€”it's a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another possibility: bromine in a different solvent or condition. Oh, right, if you have a ketone and bromine, another reaction is the addition across the carbonyl group. But cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Oh wait, no. Wait, the bromine adds to the carbonyl? Like in the case of aldehydes and ketones, bromine can add to the carbonyl group in a nucleophilic addition. But wait, in conditions where it's a dienophile? Or maybe it's a different kind of addition.

Wait, wait, no.
