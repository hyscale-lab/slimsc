Alright, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Okay, let me think through each option.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a to d, and the answers are labeled A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Option a is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. I think Earth's density is pretty high because it's mostly rock and metal. So this planet has the same density as Earth.

Option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait, the density is given here. So actually, the density is 5.5, same as Earth. But it's twice the mass. But wait, what's the radius? Because density depends on mass and radius. Oh wait, no, wait the question says "density is approximately 5.5 g/cm³." So regardless of mass, the density is given. So for this option, the density is 5.5, same as Earth. So same as a, but more mass?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because density is mass/volume. Volume depends on radius (V = (4/3)πr³). So if a planet has twice the mass but same density as Earth, then its radius must be larger. Because density is mass/volume. So if mass doubles and density stays same, volume must double. But volume is proportional to radius cubed.
