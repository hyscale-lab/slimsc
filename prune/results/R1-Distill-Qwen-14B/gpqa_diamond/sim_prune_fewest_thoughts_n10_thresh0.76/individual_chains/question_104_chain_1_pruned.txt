Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the larger the shift, I think.

The question says that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. The planets have circular orbits. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period compared to planet #1's.

Wait, so what affects the Doppler shift measured? I think it's related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(1/3)) * ( (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Sun-like), the denominator is almost 1. So K is approximately proportional to M_p / (M_star^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)))) )? Or wait, maybe another approach. Oh, right, the RV method's detected velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Since e is zero here (circular orbits), and M_p << M_star, we can approximate K ≈ (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_p is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Because K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, let me think again. Rearranging the formula:

K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, no, if K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is smaller than K2, that would mean P1 is larger than P2? Wait no, wait. Let me get this straight.

Let me write it as K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P. So
