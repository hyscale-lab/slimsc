Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question says that an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The question is about the uncertainty in energy, but I remember that the uncertainty principle usually deals with position and momentum. Oh right, because momentum is related to kinetic energy. So I think I can use the uncertainty in momentum to find the uncertainty in kinetic energy.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. I think ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. So the minimum uncertainty in momentum would be around ħ/(2Δx). But wait, sometimes people use Δp ≈ ħ/Δx, considering the order of magnitude, so maybe I can just approximate it as ħ divided by Δx to simplify calculations.

So, Δp ≈ ħ / Δx. Let me plug in the numbers. ħ is about 1e-34 J·s. The Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometers are 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. So Δp ≈ (1e-34) / (1e-10) = 1e-24 kg·m/s.

But wait, the electron's speed is given as 2e8 m/s. Does that affect anything? Oh, because momentum p is m*v. The mass of the electron is about 9.11e-31 kg. Let me check: p = m*v = 9.11e-31 kg * 2e8 m/s = 1.822e-22 kg·m/s. Hmm, but wait, the uncertainty in momentum is 1e-24, which is smaller than the actual momentum. That makes sense because the uncertainty is about the spread, not the exact value.

Now, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Since the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), the uncertainty in energy would come from the uncertainty in p. Using calculus, the uncertainty in K.E. can be approximated as ΔK ≈ (p * Δp)/(m). Let me see: since K.E. = p²/(2m), the derivative dK/dp = p/m. So ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, let me double-check that. The formula for uncertainty in a function f(p) is Δf ≈ |df/dp| * Δp. So for f(p) = p²/(2m), df/dp = p/m. So yes, ΔK ≈ (p/m) * Δp.

So plugging in the numbers: p is 1.822e-22 kg·m/s (from earlier), m is 9.11
