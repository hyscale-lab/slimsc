Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength Î» is shining on it, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Hmm, right, I remember from my optics class that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern.

Wait, the aperture is a regular N-gon, so when N is very large, it's almost like a circular aperture, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approaches a circle. But wait, the question is about the first two minima when N is infinitely large. But wait, circular apertures have their own diffraction patterns, the Bessel functions, which have specific minima positions.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the far field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk, which has a central bright spot surrounded by rings of dark and bright rings. The first minimum is at a certain angle, but this question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Hmm, but wait, in a circular aperture, there's only one minimum after the central maximum, right? Or do I confuse it with something else?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Oh wait, no, the Airy pattern has multiple minima. The first dark ring is the first minimum, then the next minima are higher order. Wait, but for a single slit, the minima are at certain positions. But wait, this is an aperture, not a slit. So perhaps it's a two-dimensional diffraction problem.

Wait, but when the aperture is a polygon with infinitely many sides (N approaches infinity), it's a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be that of a circular aperture, which is the Airy pattern. The positions of the minima in the Airy pattern are given by the zeros of the Bessel function of the first kind, J_1. The first minimum occurs at a radius where J_1(k a) = 0, where k is the wavenumber and a is the radius of the aperture.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, the first minimum is the first dark ring, and the second is the next. So what is the position of these minima?

The Bessel function J_1 has zeros at
