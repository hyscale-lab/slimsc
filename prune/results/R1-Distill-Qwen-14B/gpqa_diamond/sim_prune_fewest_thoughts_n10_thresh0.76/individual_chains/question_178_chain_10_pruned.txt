Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants determines renormalizability. Let me think.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I know that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, the gamma matrices are dimensionless, so when calculating the mass dimension, they won't contribute.

Wait, the fields ψ and ψ̄ have a certain mass dimension. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because in four spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless, and the Dirac equation requires the term ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ to have mass dimension 4. So ψ must be (4-1)/2 = 3/2.

Then, the field strength tensor F^{μν} is from electromagnetism, I think. The field tensor F has dimension 2. Because the Maxwell term is (1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}, which has to be dimension 4. Each F is dimension 2 since 2*2=4.

Now, the term σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, so each gamma is dimensionless. The commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless because it's just a matrix operation. So σ has dimensions 0 (since it's (i/2) times a commutator, which doesn't add any dimension).

So putting it all together: the Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ, ψ, and F.

Let me compute the dimensions. Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is also 3/2. F is 2. And σ is 0.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2. Wait, but σ is part of the term, so it's ψ̄ σ^{μν} ψ multiplied by F_{μν} ?

Wait, maybe I should think about each part. The term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimensions (3/2) * [σ] * (3/2). Since σ is dimensionless, that product is (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. Then multiply by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the entire term inside the Lagrangian has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

But wait, the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because when you integrate it over four dimensions, the action has to be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So the term κ (ψ̄ σ F ψ) must have dimension 4. Let me compute the dimensions.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me rephrase: The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, which is (3/2), times σ_{μν} (dimensionless), times ψ (3/2), times F^{μν} (dimension 2). So the entire term would have dimension [κ] + (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = [κ] + (3 + 2) )= [κ] +5.

This term must be dimension 4, because each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would narrow it down to options A or C.

Next, whether the theory is renormalizable. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimension. Wait no, wait. The dimension has to be ≥ - (number of spacetime dimensions)/2. Hmm, no, wait, the general rule is that a coupling with dimension d is allowed in a renormalizable theory if d ≥ 0.

Wait, wait. Let me recall: the mass dimension of the coupling in a renormalizable interaction must be ≥ - (d-4)/2, where d is the spacetime dimension. Oh wait, actually, in four dimensions, the condition is that the coupling has mass dimension ≥0. Because the term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. For a term like g φ^n, the dimension is [g] + n*(mass dimension of φ) =4. So [g] =4 -n*(dim φ). For renormalizability, [g] must be ≥0.
