Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, expectation value—right, that's like the average outcome if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

So, I think I need to compute the expectation value of each part separately and then combine them. The expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state.

First, let's break down the operator into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. I'll compute each expectation value separately and then add them together.

Starting with 10σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this part should be straightforward. The expectation value of σz is just the weighted average of the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's square the coefficients to find the probabilities. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. So the state is normalized as 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, which makes sense.

So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Plugging in the numbers: (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, multiplying by 10 gives 10 * (-0.5) = -5. So ⟨10σz⟩ is -5.

Now, the other part is 5σx. I'm a bit more rusty on σx. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the spin states. Its eigenstates are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but wait, the given state is in the eigenbasis of σz. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, I can compute the expectation value using the components of the state. Let me think: σx in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The state ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So, let's compute ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, ψ† would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], right? So when we multiply ψ† σx, we get [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5], because σx swaps the elements. Then we multiply by ψ, which is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So the product is (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) + (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2). Each term is sqrt(3)/4, so adding them gives 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. Because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you do ψ† σx ψ, it's equivalent to [a*, b*][[0,1],[1,0]] [a; b]. Which becomes a* b + b* a. Since the state is real here, it's a*b + b*a = 2ab. So in this case, a is 0.5 and b is sqrt(3)/2. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866.

So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.

Wait, wait a minute. Am I supposed to compute the expectation of σx or of 5σx? Oh, right, the problem asks for the expectation of 10σz + 5σx. So I've already calculated each part.

So ⟨10σz⟩ is -5. ⟨5σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.866 ≈ 4.33.
