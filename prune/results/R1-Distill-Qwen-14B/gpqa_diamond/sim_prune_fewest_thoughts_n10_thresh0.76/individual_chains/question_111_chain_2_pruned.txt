Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form product B. I need to choose the major products A and B from the given options.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to draw its structure in my mind. Cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, wait, no. The numbering might be different. Wait, 2 and 6 are adjacent positions on the cyclohexane ring because cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 go around. So 2 and 6 are next to each other, right?

Wait, but the molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Because 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl at positions 2 and 6. Wait, no, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one would have an ethyl group at position 2 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 6? No, wait. Wait, maybe it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Or is the structure that both 2 and 6 are substituted with a methyl group, and there's also an ethyl at position 2?

Wait, perhaps I should write it down. The compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 1 is the ketone (cyclohexanone). Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Because 2,
