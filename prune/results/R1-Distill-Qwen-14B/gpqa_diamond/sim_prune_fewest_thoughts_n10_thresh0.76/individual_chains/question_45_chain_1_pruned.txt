Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, okay, I remember that in such a well, the particles can only occupy certain energy levels based on their quantum numbers. Wait, but these are identical particles, so I think I need to consider the Pauli exclusion principle here because they're fermions. Oh right, spin-1/2 particles are fermions, so their overall wavefunction has to be antisymmetric.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy is given in terms of E, where E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each energy level is n²E, I think. Wait, no, wait. The energy levels for a particle in a 1D box are E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is n² times E, since E is defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). So yeah, each level is n²E.

Now, with four particles, we have to fill up the lowest energy levels, following the Pauli exclusion which says that each quantum state can have at most one fermion. Each quantum state is determined by its principal quantum number n and its spin state. Since they're spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states: spin up and spin down.

Wait, but wait. In a 1D box, the quantum numbers start at n=1, and each n can hold two particles (since spin up and down). So for four particles, how do they fill up?

Let me think. The ground state would be the lowest possible energy, so we fill the lowest n first.

n=1 can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold another 2. So four particles would fill n=1 and n=2 each with two particles.

Wait, but in that case, the ground state would have all four particles in the lowest possible n's. Then the energy would be sum of each particle's energy.

But wait, no. Each particle's energy is n²E. So in the ground state, two are in n=1 (energy E each), and two are in n=2 (each 4E). So total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E? Or wait, no, wait. Each particle in the same n only contributes once, but each has the same energy. Wait, no, each particle in a particular state has that energy. So since two are in n=1, each is E, so total for n=1 is 2E. Similarly, two in n=2, each is 4E, so total 8E. So the total ground state energy is 2E +8E=10E. Hmm, but wait that's 10E? But let me think.

Wait, no. No, each particle's energy is n²E. So for the ground state, the four particles are filled as n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the energy would be 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) )=
