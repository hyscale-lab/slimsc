Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state. 

Let me start by recalling what I know. The spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component vector, right? So it's a column vector with components 3i and 4. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the way it's written, (3i,4), that's probably in the order of up and down spins, I guess. Or maybe in the z-direction basis. I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's correct.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product: ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. But wait, no, wait, that's for the expectation of S_y squared, maybe? Or wait, no, wait. The expectation value of the spin component S_y is given by ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, right? So I need to compute that.

But wait, S_y is an operator. Oh, right, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrix σ_y is given, which is:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

And for spin-½ particles, the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. So when I compute the expectation value, I'll need to apply σ_y, then multiply by (ħ/2), and then take the inner product.

Wait, but wait a second. The state vector is given as (3i,4). Is that a column vector? I think so. So the state vector ψ is [3i; 4], right? Or maybe it's [4; 3i], depending on how it's written. Wait, the notation says (3i,4), which probably means the first component is 3i and the second is 4, so ψ = [3i; 4].

To compute ⟨S_y⟩, I need to calculate (ψ†) * (S_y) * ψ. Alternatively, since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, I can compute (ψ†) σ_y ψ, then multiply by ħ/2.

So let's compute that step by step. First, compute the matrix product σ_y multiplied by ψ. Then take the conjugate transpose of ψ, which is ψ†, and multiply that by the result of σ_y ψ. Then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write down σ_y again:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

ψ = [3i, 4]^T, which is [3i; 4].

So σ_y ψ would be:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i
Second component: i*(3i) + 0*(4) = i*(3i) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3

Wait, let me double-check that. So σ_y multiplied by ψ:

First row: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) → -4i
Second row: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) → 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3. So the resulting vector is [-4i; -3].

Wait, no. Wait, the multiplication is σ_y * ψ. So sigma y is a 2x2 matrix, and ψ is 2x1. So the product is:

Row 1, column 1: 0 * 3i + (-i) * 4 → 0 + (-4i) → -4i
Row 2, column 1: i * 3i + 0 *4 → 3i² → 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ]

Now, ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] because you take the complex conjugate. Wait, [3i;4] becomes [3i,4] as a row vector, and then conjugate gives [-3i,4].

So now, ψ† * (σ_y ψ) is the dot product of [-3i,4] with [ -4i; -3 ].

So it's (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) → let's compute each term.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² → i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.
Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by this result. Wait, wait. Because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) multiplied by the value we just calculated, which is -24.

Wait, no, wait. Because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the trace or the product? Let me think: The expectation is ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨ψ | σ_y | ψ⟩. And we computed ⟨ψ | σ_y | ψ⟩ as -24. So the expectation is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options have fractions. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me check my steps again. Maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me go through each step again.

ψ is [3i;4], so ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

σ_y ψ:

First element: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = (-i)*4 = -4i.
Second element: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† (σ_y ψ) is:

(-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Compute each part:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² → 12*(-1) = -12.

(4)*(-3) = -12.

Adding them: -12 + (-12) = -24.

So, σ_y's expectation value is -24. Then S_y's expectation is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ /25. Oh wait, none of the options match -12 ħ. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the state vector is not normalized. Let me check that. The state ψ is [3i;4]. The norm is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is 5. So the state is not normalized. But for expectation values, does that matter? Because the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by the norm squared, if the state is not normalized.

Wait a second! Oh my god, I completely forgot about normalization. So the expectation value is not just ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩, but ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ | ψ⟩. Because the state might not be normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized, but if they're not, you have to normalize when computing expectation values.

So here, the state is [3i;4], which has a norm squared of (3i)(-3i) + 4*4 = (9) + 16 =25. Because |3i|^2 is (3)^2 =9, and |4|^2 is 16. So the norm is 5, so the normalized state is (1/5)[3i;4].

So when computing the expectation value, it's (⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩) / ⟨ψ | ψ⟩.

So in this case, ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩ is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ. And ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is 25, so the expectation is (-12 ħ) / 25.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, sorry, the calculation for ⟨ψ | S_y | ψ⟩ is (ħ/2) times the product of ψ† σ_y ψ, which we found to be -24. So (ħ/2)*(-24) is -12 ħ. Then, since the state is not normalized, we have to divide by 25 (the norm squared). So the expectation is (-12 ħ) /25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar /25. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Did I make any mistake in the ψ† times σ_y times ψ?

Wait, ψ† is [ -3i,4 ].

σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ].

So ψ† (σ_y ψ) is (-3i)*(-4i) +4*(-3) → let me compute each term:

-3i * -4i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) =-12.

4 * (-3) =-12.

Total is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So that's correct.

Then the expectation value of σ_y is -24, so S_y's expectation is (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ. But since the state isn't normalized, the expectation is that divided by 25, the norm squared. So -12 ħ /25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar /25. So the correct answer is A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Spin Operator \( S_y \)
The spin operator \( S_y \) for a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) by:
\[
S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y,
\]
where \( \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \).

### Step 2: Expectation Value Formula
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle.
\]
Here, \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi,
\]
where \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \).

### Step 3: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \)
The state vector is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Applying \( \sigma_y \) to \( \psi \):
\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \cdot 3i + (-i) \cdot 4 \\ i \cdot 3i + 0 \cdot 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \)
The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is \( \psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Taking the dot product:
\[
\psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).
\]
- First term: \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \),
- Second term: \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).

Adding these:
\[
\psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = -12 + (-12) = -24.
\]

### Step 5: Expectation Value of \( \sigma_y \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_y \rangle = -24.
\]

### Step 6: Expectation Value of \( S_y \)
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} (-24) = -12\hbar.
\]

### Step 7: Normalize the State
The state \( \psi \) is not normalized. The norm is:
\[
\|\psi\|^2 = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]
Thus, the normalized expectation value is:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{-12\hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
