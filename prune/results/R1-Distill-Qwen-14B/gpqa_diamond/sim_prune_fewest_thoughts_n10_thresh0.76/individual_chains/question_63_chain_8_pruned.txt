Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state probably refers to the lowest energy state. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next lowest state. I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the molecule is modeled as a rotating dumbbell with a bond that can stretch a bit. But when it's in the fundamental state, maybe it's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So when it absorbs a photon, it should transition to the next higher state, which would be the first excited state.

But I'm a bit confused about whether the transition is purely vibrational or rotational. Oh wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So maybe it's a combination of vibrational and rotational transitions, but perhaps the lowest energy transition is a vibrational one? Or maybe the photon's energy is determined by the vibrational energy difference.

Wait, no. The quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy levels are actually a product of both. The fundamental state is the lowest vibration state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0), perhaps. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational quantum number or the rotational, or both. But the problem says to switch to the next state with the lowest energy, which I think would be the next vibrational state, because the vibrational energy is higher than rotational.

Wait, no. Let's think about the energy levels. Vibrational energy levels are quantized and have higher spacing than rotational. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy? Let's calculate.

The energy for v
