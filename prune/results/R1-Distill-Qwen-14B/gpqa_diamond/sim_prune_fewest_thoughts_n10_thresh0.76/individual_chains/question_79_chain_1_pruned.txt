Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It's about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. The reaction involves compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It's treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they give the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product and ask us to figure out what compound X was.

Wait, wait. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation or maybe in other epoxidations. Oh right, it's a base used to deprotonate something, maybe in an epoxide formation. So the reaction probably involves the formation of an epoxide. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Or is it maybe an elimination reaction? Or perhaps it's a ring-opening? Hmm, no, the reagent is often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst in some other reaction.

Wait, wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a catalyst in some reactions, like the Staudinger reaction? Or wait, no, that's phosphines. I think it's more commonly used as a base in certain eliminations or maybe as a ligand in some catalysts. Or, wait, another possibility: it's a commonly used base in the Corey-Fuchs reaction, or maybe in the formation of epoxides from alkenes using peracids. Wait, no, peracids would be the ones providing the oxygen for the epoxide.

Wait, the product has an epoxide ring? Because the NMR data might indicate that.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows a singlet at δ 2.28 (3H, s) and another at 2.31 (3H, s). So two methyl groups, both as singlets, probably attached to something that doesn't split their signals—maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric environment. The 13C
