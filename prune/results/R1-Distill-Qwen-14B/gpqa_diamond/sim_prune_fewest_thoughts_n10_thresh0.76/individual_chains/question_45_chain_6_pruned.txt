Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given, and E is given as (pi²ℏ²)/(2mL²), which is the standard formula for the energy levels in a 1D infinite well for a single particle, right? So each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n.

Wait, but these are four identical particles. Oh, right, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle because they're fermions (spin-1/2). So each state can be occupied by at most one particle.

In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by En = (n²)E, where E is that base energy. For one particle, the ground state is n=1: E1 = E. Then n=2: E2=4E, n=3:9E, etc.

But with four particles, how do they fill up? Since each energy level is a state with a particular n, but each n can have multiple states because of spin. Wait, no, wait. In a 1D box, each energy level En has a certain degeneracy. For spin-1/2 particles, each level can hold 2 particles, right? Because spin up and spin down.

So for each value of n, you can have two particles with the same n but different spins. So, let's list the possible n's and the maximum number of particles that can occupy each.

So the first level, n=1: can hold 2 particles.
Second level, n=2: can hold 2 particles.
n=3: 2 particles, etc.

Wait but we have four particles. So let's see:

Ground state configuration would be filling the lowest possible n's with as many as possible, considering the spin.

n=1: 2 particles.
n=2: 2 particles. That's four particles total.

So each of the first two energy levels (n=1 and n=2) are filled with 2 particles each. So the total energy would be the sum of all their energies.

Wait, but each particle's energy is En, so the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. Each
