Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The problem says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two A+ and two A- particles. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, annihilation usually involves matter and antimatter converting into energy, but here they're producing these A particles. Hmm, I remember that in annihilation, the total energy and momentum are conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate the initial momentum as just from the antiproton. But wait, the proton is moving too. Oh, but wait, the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest? Or are both moving? Hmm, the wording says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity. But wait, in reality, in a collision, both particles would contribute momentum. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial momentum is dominated by the antiproton. Or perhaps the system's initial momentum is zero if the antiproton and proton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities. Wait, that could be. Because if a proton is at rest and an antiproton is moving towards it, the initial momentum would just be the momentum of the antiproton. But if the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its momentum is low compared to the rest mass.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, their mass converts into other particles. So the initial rest mass energy plus kinetic energy should equal the total energy of the products. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics here.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Assuming that the proton has charge +e and the antiproton -e, but the A particles have charges + and -, but I don't think the charge plays into this problem beyond balancing.

But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton has mass m_p, and the antiproton also has mass m_p. The mass of the A particles is given as m_A c² =
