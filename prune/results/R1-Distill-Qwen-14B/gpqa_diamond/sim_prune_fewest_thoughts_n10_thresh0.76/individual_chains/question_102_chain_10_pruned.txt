Alright, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the confocal microscopy after the experiment. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I need to understand the setup of the experiment. We have a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, so the vector contains two genes under different promoters or regulatory elements. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES element upstream, which is a regulatory element that allows internal ribosome entry, enabling the translation of the second ORF without the need for a separate promoter, but I might be wrong on that.

Wait, actually, in bicistronic vectors, the two genes are usually arranged in a way that allows both to be expressed. The first gene is under a strong promoter, and the second might use an IRES or another promoter. In this case, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is at the 5' end. Then, the next ORF is the receptor, which is after an IRES. So, the CBA promoter drives the transcription of both the ligand and the receptor? Or does the IRES allow for expression of the receptor after the ligand? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on how bicistronic vectors work exactly.

Looking at the vector structure: ligand ORF (with CBA promoter) 5' -> then a stop in a loxP cassette, then the receptor ORF with IRES, followed by eGFP, and another stop in a lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, so the vector is set up so that each gene is under its own regulatory elements. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which probably means it's expressed in a way that the IRES allows for its translation without a promoter. But I'm not entirely sure.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 promoter, meaning Cre is active in neural crest-derived cells, like the ones where the receptor and ligand were initially expressed.

The Cre-lox system is used here for recombination. The loxP and lox2272 sites are different lox variants. The vector's setup is such that when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the expression of the respective ORFs.

So, in the vector, the ligand is under CBA promoter. After ligand ORF, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. The same goes for the receptor, with a lox2272 cassette. When Cre is active, it will recognize the lox sites and excise the stop cassette. So, in neural crest cells (where SOX10 is expressed and Cre is active), the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

But in the experiment, when they check for eGFP expression (using confocal), there's no green signal. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Let's go through the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the setup is about expression in the same cell, perhaps? Not sure. But the experiment is looking for expression in cells that have the construct. Not sure if this is the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP
