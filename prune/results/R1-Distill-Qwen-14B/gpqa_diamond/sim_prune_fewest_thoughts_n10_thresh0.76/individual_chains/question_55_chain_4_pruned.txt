Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is. The options are between cis and trans for propenyl and butenyl acetates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but let me think through this step by step.

The NMR data given is:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

I remember that the acetate group is usually around 2.1 ppm as a singlet because the three methyl protons are equivalent and not split, which matches the 2.1 ppm peak here. So that's the acetate part, likely from an ethyl ester group. So the compound is an ethyl acetate derivative, but wait, wait. Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. Oh right, those are the substituents attached to the oxygen.

Looking at the other peaks. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant J=16.0 Hz. That seems like a typical trans coupling, maybe between two aromatic protons, but wait, these aren't aromatic. Wait, no, maybe they're vinyl protons. A coupling of 16 Hz is quite large, which suggests a double bond adjacent. So perhaps that's a proton next to a double bond, maybe in a trans arrangement.

Then there's the 5.5 ppm peak as a doublet of quartets. Wait, doublet of quartets (dq) would imply that this proton is coupling with two different sets of protons. Hmm. Let me think about the structures.

The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, let's clarify what each structure looks like. For propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2COOEt, but I think propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, no, wait. Propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, but in acetates, it's the ester, so the structure would be O
