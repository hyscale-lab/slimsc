Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because NMR is tricky. Let me try to take it step by step. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their 1H NMR spectra.

The molecular formula is C10H14 for both compounds. Hmm, wait, each compound has that formula? Or the mixture together? Oh, the problem says it's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, each with C10H14. So each compound on its own must be C10H14.

The NMR spectrum shows two signals (two singlets) around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. And three signals at ~2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, so the aromatic region has two singlets, each integrating for one proton each? Or wait, the ratio is 1:1 for the two signals. But each singlet's integration might be per peak. Let me think. If it's a 1:1 ratio for the two signals, then each is integrating to one equivalent of protons. But wait, the aromatic region is probably showing the protons that are equivalent. So maybe each compound has two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, and they each contribute a singlet. But wait, they're both in the same solution, so their peaks would add up.

Wait, but the question says the solution contains a 1:1 mixture. So each compound is present in equal amounts. So for the aromatic region, each compound contributes its own protons. So if compound A has, say, two different sets of aromatic protons, and compound B has another set, then their combined spectrum would show the sum of their signals.

But in this case, the aromatic region shows two singlets. So perhaps each compound contributes one singlet each, but somehow their peaks are overlapping or in such a way that only two signals appear.

Wait, maybe each compound has only one type of aromatic proton. Because if each has only one type, then in the mixture, you would see two singlets, each corresponding to each compound. Because each compound contributes a singlet, and they're in a 1:1 ratio, so the integration is 1 each. So each compound would have all equivalent aromatic protons, which would explain a singlet.

Wait, but for a benzene ring with substituents, having all equivalent protons would require a very symmetric structure. Like para substitution or something with high symmetry.

Looking at the options, let's list them all:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl.

Option C: 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

Wait, let me try to draw each structure mentally.

1,2,3
