Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. The magnetic moment is aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when you change the magnetic field direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the dynamics of the system. Spin 1/2 particles have two possible states, and their spin precesses around the direction of the magnetic field.

Wait, the initial state is aligned with the magnetic field along +Z. So initially, the spin is in the +Z direction. Then the field is switched to +Y. So the Hamiltonian before and after the switch must be considered.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z, so the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma * S_z. The energy is -mu Â· B. So for B in +Z, the energy is -mu_z * B = -gamma S_z B. So the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -gamma B S_z.

But then the field is turned off and another along +Y is turned on. So the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but when the field is turned off and then on again, does the spin state change? Or does it remain in the same state immediately after? I think that when the field changes abruptly, the state of the system doesn't change instantaneously. So the state right after the field change is the same as it was before the change.

Wait, before the change, the particle was in a magnetic field along +Z. So its spin was aligned with +Z. Since it's a spin 1/2 particle, the possible states are |+z> and |-z>, with eigenvalues +1/2 and -1/2 for S_z. So the initial state is |+z>, since the magnetic moment is aligned with the field.

Then, the field is turned off, so the magnetic field in the z
