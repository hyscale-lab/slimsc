Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations, which I remember can get a bit tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions—500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given as A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I think I need to figure out what's happening when these substances are mixed. Mixing acids and bases usually leads to some neutralization reaction. So maybe I should consider the moles of each acid and base component.

Let me list out the components. There's CH3COOH, which is acetic acid, a weak acid. Then there's HCl, a strong acid. And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a metal hydroxide. So, when we mix these, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess. The excess will determine the pH. If there's excess H+, it's acidic, and if there's excess OH-, it's basic. If they're equal, it's neutral.

Wait, but I should also consider that HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, releasing H+ ions. Acetic acid is weak, so it won't dissociate completely, but maybe I can treat it as a source of some H+ ions. Wait, no—wait, when considering neutralization, maybe I should first calculate the total H+ from both acids and the total OH- from the base.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions when it dissociates. So, for each mole of Ba(OH)2, I get two moles of OH-.

So first, let me compute the moles of each component.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) is moles per liter. Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. So moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. But wait, in the context of neutralization with a base, perhaps I should consider all CH3COOH as a source of H+? Or wait—no, because it's a weak acid, it won't completely donate H+ ions. Hmm, but when mixed with a strong base, the reaction will be as follows: perhaps the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid first, and then any excess OH- would affect the solution's pH.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by first finding the total H+ contributed by both the strong and weak acids, then see how much OH- is present from the base.

Wait, but wait—HCl is a strong acid. So it will dissociate completely, so each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole gives two moles of OH-.

So let's compute each.

First, let's find the moles of H+ from HCl.

HCl: 0.2 M, 400 mL. So moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.08 moles H+.

Then, CH3COOH: 0.1 M, 500 mL. Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't contribute as much H+. But when considering
