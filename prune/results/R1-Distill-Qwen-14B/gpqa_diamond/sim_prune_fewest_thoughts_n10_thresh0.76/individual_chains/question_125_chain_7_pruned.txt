Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential. So I remember that in three dimensions, especially when it's isotropic, the problem can be broken down into three one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, each in the x, y, and z directions. But wait, maybe it's easier to think in spherical coordinates since the potential depends only on r.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the kinetic and potential energies are expressed in terms of r, theta, and phi. But for the harmonic oscillator potential like this, the radial part might have a specific solution. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the quantum numbers for each dimension.

But wait, the energy levels for a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by something like E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Or wait, actually, each direction (x, y, z) contributes (n_i + ½) ħω, so the total is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes people use a different notation where the total quantum number is n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but the question is about the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy, which would be when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0, giving E = (0+0+0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when one of the quantum numbers is 1. So possible states are like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). Each of these has energy E = (1+0+0 + 3/2) = (5/2) ħω. So, the first excited state is (5/2) ħω. The next, second excited state would be higher. Let me think: maybe when two quantum numbers are 1, like (1,1,0). Then the energy is (1+1+
