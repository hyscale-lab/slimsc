Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question asks which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a to d, each describing different planets. My goal is to figure out the density of each and compare them.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, density = mass/volume. But for planets, especially when we don't know their exact composition, sometimes we have to make assumptions. Oh wait, the options mention Earth's composition, so maybe that's a clue.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is something I should know. Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So if this planet has Earth's mass and radius, its density would be the same as Earth's. So a) has density 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the question says the density is already given. So b) has a density of 5.5. So same as a), but higher mass. But since the question is about density, this one's density is already stated. So b) is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Hmm. Same composition as Earth implies same average density as Earth, right? Because density is mass/volume, and composition affects how much mass is in a given volume. If it's same composition, then mass scales with volume, which is radius cubed. So, if the mass is 5 times Earth's, what about the radius?

Let me think. The mass of a planet is proportional to (radius)^3, assuming same density. So Earth's mass is M, radius R. Here, mass is 5M. So (R_new)^3 = 5 R^3 → R_new = cube root(5) R. Approximately cube root of 5 is around 1.7, so radius is about 1.7 times Earth's.

But since density is same, the density here is 5.5 as well. So c) has density 5.5.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Same logic as c. So the mass is 0.
