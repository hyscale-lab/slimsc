Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, okay, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, they want the relationship between the number of stars and the distance r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, more accurately, plx in arcseconds is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance (r, I guess they're using r here), let's substitute that in.

If plx = 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. So N ∝ (r)^5. Because 1/( (1/r) )^5 is r^5. Wait, let me clarify that.

Wait, N = k * (1 / plx^5 ), where k is some constant. And plx is 1/r. So substituting, N = k * (1 / ( (1/r) )^5 ) = k * (r^5 / 1) ) because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, so maybe they want the number per unit distance? Or the differential, like how the number of stars per unit volume (or per unit distance) changes with r.

Wait, no, wait. The way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So the change in number with distance, in terms of r.

Wait, but from the expression N ∝ r^5, that suggests that as r increases, N increases as the fifth
