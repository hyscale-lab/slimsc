Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given has several terms. Let me parse it. The first term is i bar(N_R) gamma^mu partial_mu N_R. That looks like a Dirac term for a right-handed neutrino or something similar. Then there's (1/2)(partial phi)^2, which is the kinetic term for a scalar phi. The next term is |D^mu S|^2, so that's a covariant derivative for a scalar doublet S. Then there's a term with y_i/2 * phi * bar(N^c_{iR}) N^c_{iR}. Wait, so this is a Yukawa coupling between the singlet phi and the right-handed neutrinos, but they're charge conjugated. 

Then there's a term with g_{i alpha} bar(N_{iR}) L_alpha S. Hmm, L_alpha is probably the lepton doublet, so this is a coupling between the right-handed neutrinos, leptons, and the scalar S. Finally, the potential V(phi, S, H). Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, the fields are phi, S, and H. Or wait, the potential is V(phi, S, H), but I don't see H in the other terms. Oh, maybe H is another scalar field, like the Higgs?

Wait, the question mentions the singlet fermions N_iR with quantum numbers (1,1,0). So they're SU(2) singlets, hypercharge 0. The scalar S is a doublet (1,2,1), so SU(2) doublet, hypercharge 1. Phi is a singlet scalar (1,1,0). 

The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given: ⟨phi⟩² = x² + v², where ⟨phi⟩=x and ⟨h⟩=v. Wait, h is the Higgs? So maybe the Higgs is another field, H, which gets a VEV v. Or perhaps phi is a singlet that gets a VEV x, and the Higgs field (maybe H) gets a VEV v. 

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons usually arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking when a symmetry is broken, but the Goldstone is 'eaten' by a gauge boson, making it massive. Wait, but in the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism gives mass to the W and Z bosons, but the Higgs field has a component that's the physical Higgs (like h) and the Goldstone bosons are eaten. 

But the question is about an extension. So perhaps this model has additional scalars, and when they get VEVs, some are Goldstone bosons. The pseudo-Goldstone would have a mass at tree level
