Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because symmetry questions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3H symmetry. Hmm, wait, no, wait. I think I read that wrong. Oh wait, no, the question says 'C3H symmetry.' Wait, what's that? Oh wait, wait, no, maybe it's a typo. Because symmetry groups are usually denoted with letters like C3, D3, Td, etc. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a misread. Maybe it's C3v symmetry? Or maybe it's C3h symmetry? Or perhaps the question is correct, and it's C3H symmetry, which I'm not sure about. Wait, maybe I should think about what each option looks like.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, another with benzo in the name, and another with triphenyleno. Let's see.

First, I need to recall what C3H symmetry means. Wait, maybe it's C3h? Because symmetry elements can have different types, like Cn, Sn, Dnh, etc. Wait, C3h would imply a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about C3 symmetry, which is a three-fold rotation without any mirrors. Because I'm a bit confused about the H here. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and the correct symmetry is C3 or maybe S3, but I think the question is correct in its wording.

Wait, let me think. The point group for a molecule with a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane would be C3h. Alternatively, if it has a three-fold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, it would be D3. Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each molecule's structure.

Let's look at each option:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The name sounds complicated, but perhaps it's a tricyclic structure with multiple rings. Wait, the 'trifuran' part suggests three furan rings. The substituents might be arranged symmetrically.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, similar structure but with a benzo ring attached.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. That's a borate ester with three isopropyl groups attached to boron. So structure-wise, it's like B with three isopropyl-O- groups. Each isopropyl is (CH(CH3)2)O- attached to B. So the molecule has three identical substituents around boron. So what symmetry does that give?

Boron is the central atom with three isopropyl groups. So arrangement is trigonal planar? Each group is the same. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis through the boron atom. So the point group would be C3. Because each substituent is the same, so a three-fold rotation would map the molecule onto itself. So C3 symmetry.

Wait, but wait, but each isopropyl group has a certain structure. The isopropyl groups are all the same, so rotation by 120 degrees should leave the molecule looking the same. So yes, C3 symmetry.

Now, quinuclidine is option D. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a norbornane-like structure but with a different arrangement. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system, which is a bridged structure. It's a tricyclic compound, but more importantly, does it have any symmetry?

Wait, quinuclidine's structure is a bridge with three bridges of equal length. So the molecule is symmetric but I think it has S4 symmetry, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a C2 axis. Wait, I'm not sure. I think quinuclidine has a center of inversion. Wait, no, wait, norbornane (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) has a center of inversion, but quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane which has a higher symmetry. Let me think. Each bridge is of two carbons, so it's more symmetric. So quinuclidine's structure is quite symmetric. It has a three-fold rotation axis? No, because the molecule is more about bridged rings. Wait, perhaps it has a C2 axis. Or maybe it's a higher symmetry, like Td or something. Hmm, I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe it has a C3 axis because of the way the substituents are arranged. Wait, no, I think quinuclidine has a high symmetry but perhaps a C2 axis and a center of inversion, making it belong to the D2h point group. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about C3H symmetry. So if triisopropyl borate has C3 symmetry, that's a possibility. But what about the others?

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... So that's a structure with three furan rings connected, perhaps arranged in a symmetric way. Benzo indicates a benzene ring attached. Alternatively, perhaps the three furan rings are arranged in a symmetric fashion around a central point. If the three substituents are arranged symmetrically, then C3 symmetry could exist. But since it's connected to a benzene ring as well, maybe it's a bit more complex. Wait, but if the three furan substituents are in a trigonal planar arrangement, then it would have C3 symmetry.

Wait, but triphenyleno in option A must have three phenyl groups attached in a symmetric way. Let me picture that. Triphenylene is a molecule with three benzene rings connected in a symmetric way, perhaps forming a trigonal planar structure. Triphenylene itself is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings connected at a central point. So if the structure is symmetric, it might have C3 symmetry.

Wait, but the molecule in option A is triphenyleno with trifuran parts. So the central part is a triphenylene (three benzene rings in a symmetric arrangement) connected to three furan rings. So the overall structure would have threefold symmetry because of the triphenylene part. So the entire molecule would have C3 symmetry.

Wait, but what about the substituents on the furan rings? The numbering is 1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Wait, wait, hexa-one implies six ketone groups? No, wait, hexaone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Wait, no, wait: 'trifuran' means three furan rings. So each furan is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The substituents would be at certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a tricyclic system with three furan rings connected in a symmetric way, such as a triphenylene core with three furan substituents at each corner. So, that would make the whole structure symmetric with a three-fold axis.

Comparing the options, triisopropyl borate (option C) certainly has three identical substituents around the central B, so that's a clear C3 symmetry. However, the question is about which has C3H symmetry. Wait, now I'm getting confused. If the question is about C3H symmetry, which is a point group, then perhaps I should think about each molecule's point group.

Wait, point groups: C3 has a three-fold rotation axis. C3H would imply a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. Or is it that H is a horizontal mirror plane? Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering. CnH is a cyclic group with a horizontal mirror. So for C3H, the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should think about each molecule's symmetry.

Triisopropyl borate has a central B with three identical isopropyl groups. So the structure is symmetric with three identical groups around B. The molecule is planar around B? No, because each isopropyl group is in a plane, but the arrangement around B is trigonal planar. So the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C3 point group, which is only the three-fold axis without any mirrors.

Now, another point: triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, so its point group is C3. So it has C3 symmetry, which is a three-fold rotation.

What about quinuclidine? Quinuclidine's structure is a bridge with three bridges, each of two carbons. So the molecule has a center of inversion, which would imply that its point group is S4 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's Td, but that's for more complex structures. Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a high degree of symmetry. It's actually a cubane-like structure but with different bridge lengths. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a C3 symmetry. No, wait, because each bridge is two carbons, and rotating by 120 degrees would not map onto itself, because the bridges are at 60, 180, and 300 degrees or something like that. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the actual structure. Quinuclidine has three bridges, each two carbons long. So if you imagine the molecule, it has three bridges arranged symmetrically. So when you rotate it by 120 degrees, each bridge would move to the position of another. So maybe quinuclidine has a C3 symmetry. So its point group would be C3.

But wait, I'm not certain. I think quinuclidine's point group is actually C3 because of the three-fold symmetry in the bridge structure. So if that's the case, then both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine have C3 symmetry. But the question is which one has C3H symmetry.

Wait, perhaps another approach: which of the options has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, triisopropyl borate is flat around the B atom. So the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the plane of the B and the substituents. Alternatively, if there's a horizontal mirror plane, perhaps it's a plane cutting through the B, reflecting the substituents. Hmm, but if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would exist. Wait, but is triisopropyl borate planar? Boron is spÂ² hybridized, so the molecule is trigonal planar, so yes, it's planar. So in that case, a horizontal mirror plane (like the plane of the molecule) would be present. So the point group would be C3h, not just C3.

Wait, that's an important point. Because if the molecule is planar and has a three-fold rotation axis, and the plane of the molecule is a mirror plane, then the point group is C3h.

Wait, so for triisopropyl borate, the structure is planar, so a horizontal mirror plane exists. So its point group is C3h, which is C3H symmetry as per the question.

Then, looking back at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate, so it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me think again.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran. The triphenylene part is symmetric, but the trifuran partsâeach is a furan ring attached in a symmetric fashion. So if the molecule is symmetric across a plane, perhaps it has C3h symmetry. Alternatively, if the molecule is non-planar, then it would be C3.

But furan rings are planar, so the entire molecule would be planar, meaning a horizontal mirror plane exists. So perhaps option A also has C3h symmetry. Wait, but how many rings are attached? The name suggests three furan rings, perhaps arranged symmetrically. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a plane of symmetry, which would make it C3h.

So then why would the answer be option A, B, C, or D?

Wait, the question is which has C3H symmetry. So if both triisopropyl borate (option C) and option A have C3h symmetry, that complicates things. Unless I'm making a mistake.

Wait, but I'm not sure about option A. The structure is triphenylene attached to three furan rings. So perhaps the molecule ends up being non-planar. For example, if the furan rings are in different planes, the overall molecule might not be planar. Alternatively, perhaps the entire structure is flat, making a mirror plane possible.

Alternatively, the key is whether the molecule has a center of inversion or not. Because if a molecule has a center of inversion, it can't have certain symmetry elements. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the structures:

Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule, with a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, so C3h.

The other options:

Quinuclidine: not planar, has a three-dimensional structure, so perhaps C3 symmetry but not C3h.

Option B: benzo...trifuran. The benzo part is a benzene ring, which is planar, but if the trifuran is connected in a way that distorts planarity, then maybe the molecule as a whole isn't flat. Or maybe it is. I'm not certain.

Option A: triphenyleno...trifuran. Triphenylene is a planar molecule, and the trifuran parts might be connected in a planar way, so the whole molecule is planar, leading to C3h symmetry.

Wait, but if that's the case, both options A and C could have C3h symmetry. But the options are only four, so perhaps I made a mistake in assessing.

Wait, another thought: the question lists four options, each labeled A to D. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...

B) benzo[...]trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, the correct answer is either C or another, depending on their symmetry.

Wait, but in the options, only option C is a borate. So perhaps that's the right one.

Wait, another approach: think about the point group of each option.

Triisopropyl borate: planar, three identical substituents. So point group C3h.

Quinuclidine: bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The structure is symmetric but not planar. It has a three-fold axis. Wait, but I think quinuclidine has a point group of Td, which is tetrahedral symmetry, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I think it's D3h. Wait, but D3h has a three-fold axis and mirror planes. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe looking up point groups for common molecules would help. Quinuclidine is a norbornane derivative. Norbornane (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) has a point group of C2h. Quinuclidine, being more symmetric, has a higher symmetry. Wait, maybe it's C3v. Or perhaps D3h.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of symmetry elements. Triisopropyl borate has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, so C3h. Quinuclidine, perhaps, has a three-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane, making it D3.

If that's the case, then triisopropyl borate would have C3h symmetry, which is the answer.

So the correct answer would be option C, triisopropyl borate.

Wait, but the question's options list option C as triisopropyl borate. So the answer is C.

Wait, but I thought option A had a C3h symmetry. But perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. The triphenyleno part is the central core, which is symmetric. So the molecule would have three-fold symmetry. But if it's connected to three furan rings, which are all in the same plane, then the entire molecule would be planar, leading to a C3h symmetry.

But I'm not certain about the structure of option A. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a tricyclic structure where the three rings are arranged around a center, leading to planarity and C3h symmetry.

Wait, but without the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. But considering that triisopropyl borate is definitely planar and has three identical groups, it's a safe bet that it has C3h symmetry. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **CâH** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **CâH** symmetry implies the presence of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

### Option A: **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule consists of a triphenylene core (three benzene rings arranged symmetrically) connected to three furan rings. The triphenylene core itself is planar and symmetric, and the furan rings are likely arranged in a trigonal planar fashion. This suggests the molecule is planar and has a three-fold rotation axis. However, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is uncertain due to the complexity of the furan attachments. While it may have **Câ** symmetry, there is ambiguity about whether it satisfies the **CâH** requirement.

### Option B: **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule features a benzo ring attached to a trifuran system. The benzo ring introduces asymmetry, and the overall structure is unlikely to be planar. As a result, it does not exhibit **CâH** symmetry.

### Option C: **Triisopropyl borate**
This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The trigonal planar arrangement of the substituents around boron gives the molecule a three-fold rotation axis. Additionally, the molecule is planar, meaning a horizontal mirror plane exists. This satisfies the criteria for **CâH** symmetry, making this option a strong candidate.

### Option D: **Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure, which is a highly symmetric but non-planar molecule. It has a three-fold rotation axis but lacks a horizontal mirror plane due to its three-dimensional arrangement. Therefore, it does not exhibit **CâH** symmetry.

### Conclusion
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that clearly exhibits **CâH** symmetry due to its planar structure, three-fold rotation axis, and horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
