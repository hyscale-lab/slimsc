Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to figure out what's going on.

The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential V(r, θ) is given as (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, which I think means finding the possible energy levels the particle can have.

Hmm, I remember that in two-dimensional systems, especially when using polar coordinates, the potential can sometimes be separable into radial and angular parts. So maybe I should try to express the given potential in terms of r and θ and see if it can be split into functions each depending only on r or θ.

Breaking down the potential: V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr², which gives V = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Wait, or maybe I should write it as V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ). Wait, let's compute:

1/2 kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ = (kr²) [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ] = kr² [ (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2 ].

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the potential as V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, maybe I can separate the terms into r and θ parts. Let me see: 

The first term is only a function of r, and the second term is a function of both r and θ. So maybe I can see the potential as V(r,θ) = V_r(r) + V_theta(theta), where V_r(r) is (1/2) kr² and V_theta(theta) is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, but that's not exactly right because the second term depends on r² as well. So perhaps that doesn't help in separation.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. If the potential can be written as a sum of terms each dependent on r and angular variables separately, then perhaps the system is separable. But in this case, it's V(r) plus another term that's V(r) multiplied by a function of θ. Hmm.

Wait a second, in polar coordinates, the kinetic energy term in the Hamiltonian is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²). The potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So the potential can be rewritten as V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Alternatively, V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ.

Wait, perhaps I can see this as a harmonic oscillator in r and another term that's also harmonic in θ. Let me think. The term (3/2) kr² cos²θ can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² * [ (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ] 
= (1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² (1) + (3/4) kr² cos(2θ)
= (1/2 + 3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos(2θ)
= (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos(2θ)
= kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos(2θ) ]

Hmm, perhaps this helps. Now, the potential is expressed in terms of cos(2θ), which suggests that the angular part might relate to a potential that's proportional to cos(2θ). 

Wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², but here the potential is more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the entire system can be broken down into a radial harmonic oscillator and an angular component.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the effective potential in polar coordinates. The energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. The kinetic energy in polar coordinates is (p_r^2)/(2m) + (p_θ^2)/(2m r²). The potential is V(r,θ) as given.

But this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can write the Hamiltonian and see if it's separable.

The Hamiltonian H is (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²
