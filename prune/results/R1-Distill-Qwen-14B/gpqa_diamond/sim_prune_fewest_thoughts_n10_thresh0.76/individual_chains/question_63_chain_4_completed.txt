Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule's transition between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made up of atoms X and Y. They've given me the masses (Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu), the bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of the photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the model here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, in this model, the energy levels combine both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, the question is about the momentum of the absorbed photon. So, I'm guessing this is a transition where the photon provides the necessary energy to move the molecule to the next state.

Wait, when they say the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think they're referring to the lowest energy state that's higher than the current one. Since the fundamental state is the lowest, the next state would probably be the first excited state. But I need to clarify whether this transition involves both vibrational and rotational energy changes.

Wait a second, the fundamental state would be the state with the lowest possible energy, which in the non-rigid rotor model includes both vibrational and rotational contributions. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the fundamental state refers to the vibrational ground state, n=0, and rotational ground state J=0. But in other contexts, the fundamental state might be the lowest energy state considering both.

Wait, the problem says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, the molecule is currently in the fundamental (lowest) state. To get to the next lowest state, the photon must provide the energy difference between these two states.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are given by E = B J (J + 1) + something for vibration. Wait, no, wait, no, wait. Wait, the non-rigid rotor model is different from the rigid rotor. In the rigid rotor model, the energy is purely rotational, but the non-rigid one accounts for bond vibrations as well. So the energy levels would include both vibrational and rotational terms.

But for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are often treated as a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So maybe the energy levels are given by E = E_vib + E_rot, where E_vib is the vibrational energy and E_rot is the rotational energy.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number (n=0,1,2...). The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J + 1), with B being the rotational constant.

But for the non-rigid rotor, the rotational constant B isn't fixed because the bond length can change due to vibrations. Hmm, this might complicate things, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can treat B as a constant, or maybe the problem simplifies by considering that the main contribution comes from the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the photon's energy is absorbed, so the transition would typically involve a change in the vibrational state, because rotational transitions usually require lower energy photons (since B is much smaller than the vibrational energy). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the transition is from the (J, v) state to the next one, which could be either J+1 or v+1.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So that's the lowest energy state, which is the state where both J and v are at their lowest possible values. So J=0 and v=0. Then, the next possible state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So the next state could be either J=1, v=0 or J=0, v=1.

Which of these has a lower energy? Let's calculate the energy difference for each transition.

The vibrational energy for v=0 is (0 + 1/2) h w = (1/2) h w. For v=1, it's (3/2) h w, so the difference would be h w.

The rotational energy for J=0 is B * 0 * 1 = 0. For J=1, it's B * 1 * 2 = 2B. So the difference is 2B.

So the photon's energy should be the difference between the two states. The question is, which transition requires a smaller photon energy: from J=0 to J=1 (2B) or from v=0 to v=1 (h w)?

If 2B is less than h w, then the photon for J transition is lower energy. But I need to find which is the case here.

Wait, the problem is asking for the momentum of the photon. So let's compute which transition is allowed and gives the next lowest energy.

But wait, in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J +1). The rotational constant B is (ħ²)/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. I is μ R², and μ is the reduced mass.

So, let me compute B and see if 2B is less than h w or not.

Given that:

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu.

Wait, 20*2=40, Mx+My=22, so μ = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.66 ≈ approx 3.01, so 3.01e-27 kg.

Then, R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = (3.01e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m². So I = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Then, B is ħ²/(2 I). ħ is h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4π²).

Alternatively, let's compute B numerically.

B = (h/(2π))² / (2 I) ) = h²/(4 π² * 2 I) ) = h²/(8 π² I).

Wait, but in terms of units, B has units of energy/(angular momentum)^2?

Wait, B is actually in units of cm^-1, but perhaps better to compute it in terms of energy.

Wait, let me compute B in terms of energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy for J=1 and the vibrational energy for v=1 and compare.

Let's compute both 2B and h w.

Given w is 4e14 rad/s.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s.

So h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, what is 2B?

B = (h²)/(8 π² I)

Wait, let's compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

Then, 8 π² I: 8 * (9.8696) * I.

I is 1.204e-46 kg m².

So 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So 8 π² I ≈ 78.9568 * 1.204e-46 ≈ 95.0e-46 = 9.5e-45.

Wait, no, wait, 78.9568 *1.204e-46 = let's compute that.

78.9568 *1.204 = approximately 78.9568 *1.2 is about 94.75, and 78.9568 *0.004 is about 0.316, so total around 95.066. So 95.066e-46 → 9.5066e-45.

So denominator is 8 π² I ≈ 9.5066e-45.

So B = (4.39e-67 J² s²) / (9.5066e-45 kg m²) )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula for B is B = (h^2) / (8 π² I) ) 

But wait, B has units of energy. Because E_rot is B J (J+1), so B must have units of energy.

Wait, since I is in kg m², and h has units J s.

h^2 is (J s)^2 = J² s².

Then, denominator is 8 π² I, which has units kg m².

So (J² s²) / (kg m²) ) → J² s² / (kg m²) ) → Let's see, J is kg m²/s².

So J² is kg² m^4/s^4.

So numerator is kg² m^4/s^4 * s² → kg² m^4 / s².

Denominator is kg m².

So overall, (kg² m^4/s²) ) / (kg m²) ) → kg m²/s², which is J.

So yes, B has units of energy.

So substituting the numbers:

4.39e-67 J² s² / 9.5066e-45 kg m² → (4.39e-67 / 9.5066e-45) J.

Compute 4.39e-67 / 9.5e-45 → approximately 4.62e-23 J.

Wait, 4.39 /9.5 is about 0.462, and 1e-67 /1e-45 =1e-22. So 0.462e-22 → 4.62e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.62e-23 J.

So 2B is about 9.24e-23 J.

Now, h w was 2.65e-19 J. So h w is much larger than 2B. So the vibrational transition requires a higher energy than the rotational one. So the next state with the lowest energy would be the J=1, v=0 state. So the photon must supply the energy needed to go from J=0, v=0 to J=1, v=0.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the rigid rotor model, the rotational transitions are ΔJ = ±2, because of the selection rules. Oh wait, but the problem here is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the transition is allowed, but the selection rules are a bit different.

Wait, selection rules for rotational transitions in a diatomic molecule are that ΔJ = ±1. Wait, no, that's for electric dipole transitions. Oh right, for rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. So from J=0, you can go to J=1.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). The energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B (2) - 0 = 2B.

So the photon's energy must be 2B.

Wait, but in our case, B is about 4.62e-23 J. So 2B would be 9.24e-23 J.

Wait, but the options given are in the order of ~1e-27 to ~2e-27 Ns. Wait, Ns is kg m/s, so the momentum. So p = h/λ, and E = h f = p c, but since c is a constant, p = E/(c). So if the energy is 2B, then the momentum p is (2B c)^(-1) ?

Wait, no, E = pc^2, but for photons, E = pc. Wait, no, sorry, photons have E = pc, because their mass is zero. So p = E / c.

So if the energy is 2B, then p = (2B)/c.

Wait, but let me compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So 2B is 9.24e-23 J.

So p = (9.24e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But wait, that's way smaller than any of the options, which are ~1e-27 Ns. So this doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the vibrational transition instead. Because the rotational transition's required photon has a much lower energy, but in reality, the rotational transitions require lower frequencies, so higher wavelength photons, which have lower momentum.

Wait, the options given are all on the order of 1e-27, which is 1e-27 kg m/s. Let me compute the momentum for the vibrational transition.

The energy for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1 is ΔE = h w (since (3/2 - 1/2) h w = h w).

So E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p = E / c = (2.65e-19 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is close. But wait, this is the momentum for the vibrational transition. So why is the question's answer not matching any of the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) and the rotational state J=0, and it's transitioning to the next state, which is either J=1 or v=1. But which transition requires less energy?

As I computed earlier, 2B is about 9e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, meaning the photon's energy would be 2B, but as I calculated earlier, p would be 3e-31 kg m/s, which is about 3e-31 Ns. But none of the options are that small. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule can transition to either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, and we choose the one that gives the smallest energy increase.

But in that case, the rotational transition (2B) is lower than the vibrational transition (h w). So the photon's energy is 2B.

But earlier, when I computed 2B, I found it to be about 9.24e-23 J, which when divided by c gives 3.08e-31 kg m/s. That's way smaller than any of the options.

Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the model being used is different. The question mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which may have different energy expressions.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational energy isn't just purely B J (J+1). But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can treat B as a constant and proceed as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the model they're using includes both the rotation and vibration in such a way that the energy levels are a sum of vibrational and rotational terms, but transitions are allowed where either J changes by ±1 and v changes by ±1. But that's not likely since usually, rotational transitions require different selection rules.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. So the energy change is h w. But in that case, the photon's energy is h w, and the momentum is (h w)/(c).

So let's compute that:

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is about 8.8e-28 Ns. The options are A:1.9e-28, B:2.3e-27, C:1.1e-27, D:1.4e-28.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match. The closest is option A, 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of my calculated value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate E = h w.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

So E =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J. Yes, correct.

Then, p = E/(c) = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = approximately 8.83e-28 kg m/s. So 8.83e-28 Ns.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering a vibrational transition but a rotational one. But as I saw earlier, the rotational transition requires lower energy, but the momentum is even smaller.

Wait, maybe I should instead compute the momentum based on the rotational transition, which is 2B, but perhaps I messed up the calculation of B.

Wait, let me re-calculate B.

B = h^2/(8 π² I )

Wait, I is mu R^2.

mu is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) ) ) = (20 * 2)/(22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So mu = 1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute that.

1.8 *1.66 = approx 2.988, and 0.018 *1.66=0.02988. So total approx 3.01788e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

So I = mu R² = 3.01788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01788e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20715e-46 kg m².

Now compute B = (h^2) / (8 pi² I )

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi² I ≈ 8 * (9.8696) * 1.20715e-46.

8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

78.9568 *1.20715e-46 ≈ let's compute 78.9568 * 1.20715.

78.9568 *1.2=94.748, 78.9568*0.00715≈ 0.564. So total approx 95.312e-46 → 9.5312e-45.

So denominator is 9.5312e-45 kg m².

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.5312e-45 = approx 4.605e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.21e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.21e-23 J.

Then, p = E_photon / c = 9.21e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close to that. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the transition that includes both a vibrational and rotational change. But that would make the energy difference the sum of the two, which would be even higher. So that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman transition, where both rotational and vibrational states change. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up the rotational and vibrational contributions. Another thought: perhaps the problem is actually considering the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) but allowing a change in rotational state. So the molecule is in J=0, v=0, and the next state is J=1, v=0. But that's a rotational transition.

But then the photon's energy is 2B, which as calculated, would be way too small compared to the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0, v=0 to J=0, v=1. So the energy change is h w.

Which would give p = h w / c =8.83e-28 Ns.

But the closest option is A:1.9e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute p for the vibrational transition.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E / c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = approximately 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

So 8.83e-28 Ns. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of that. Hmm, maybe I missed a factor of 1/5.

Alternatively, perhaps the given w is the vibrational frequency, and the rotational constant B is in terms of cm^-1, but perhaps I should have used a different unit conversion.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the momentum is given as p = h/(2π c) * something.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong relation between E and p. Alternatively, perhaps the photon's energy is given by E = p c, which is correct. So p = E / (c).

So for the vibrational transition, E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = (2.65e-19) / (3e8) → 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible options.

The given options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

I calculated 8.8e-28 for the vibrational transition and 3e-31 for the rotational. Neither match the options.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational transition again, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy difference as B* (J=1) - B*(J=0) = 2B.

But earlier, the calculation of B was 4.6e-23 J, so 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

Photon's momentum: p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 Ns.

It's way too small.

But all the options are much larger. So perhaps I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, wait, maybe I should consider the rotational energy in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, the rotational energy can be expressed as E_rot = ħ ω_rot J (J+1), where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

And ω_rot is related to the rotational constant B by B = ħ ω_rot / 2.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate ω_rot.

Given that B = ħ^2/(2 I), so ω_rot = 2 B / ħ.

So, ω_rot = 2*(h^2/(8 pi^2 I )) ) / (h/(2 pi)) )

Simplify:

= [ (h²/(4 pi² I )) ] * (2 pi / h )

= (h² * 2 pi ) / (4 pi² I h )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

h^2 * 2 pi → denominator:4 pi² I h → 4 pi^2 I h.

So,

= (2 pi h²) / (4 pi² I h) )= (2 h )/(4 pi I ) )= h/( 2 pi I )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps it's easier to compute ω_rot.

Alternatively, ω_rot = sqrt( (k) / (mu) ), where k is the force constant, but I don't have k here. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another way.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I as B = ħ²/(2 I), correct. So ω_rot = 2B/ħ.

So, ω_rot = 2 * (h²/(8 pi² I )) ) / (h/(2 pi)) )

= (2 h²/(8 pi² I )) ) * (2 pi)/h )

= [2 h² * 2 pi ] / [8 pi² I * h ]

Simplify numerator: 4 pi h².

Denominator: 8 pi² I h.

So,

= (4 pi h²) / (8 pi² I h) )

= (4 h²) / (8 pi I h )

= (4 h ) / (8 pi I )

= h/(2 pi I )

Hmm, so ω_rot = h/(2 pi I )

Wait, but that might not help me directly. Maybe I should compute ω_rot in terms of the given variables.

I is mu R^2.

So,

ω_rot = h/(2 pi mu R^2 )

So, substituting the numbers:

h=6.626e-34 J s.

mu=3.01788e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

So,

ω_rot = (6.626e-34) / (2 pi * 3.01788e-27 * (2e-10)^2 )

Compute denominator:

2 pi ≈6.2832.

3.01788e-27 kg.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So denominator=6.2832 *3.01788e-27 *4e-20.

Compute 6.2832 *3.01788≈6.2832 *3=18.8496, 6.2832 *0.01788≈0.112, so total ≈18.9616.

Multiply by 4e-20:

18.9616 *4e-20 =75.8464e-20 =7.58464e-19.

So denominator =7.58464e-19.

So ω_rot =6.626e-34 /7.58464e-19 ≈ 8.733e-16 rad/s.

Wait, that's a very low angular frequency. So the rotational energy difference is E = ħ ω_rot (J+1) J.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should consider another approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which is v=1, J=0. So the energy change is h w.

So the momentum is p = h w /c → (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8.

Wait, that gives 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 Ns. But none of the options match this.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy change again.

Wait, for J=0 to J=1, the energy change is 2B. If B is 4.6e-23 J, then 2B is 9.2e-23 J.

p = 9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 Ns.

Which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, this is puzzling. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement.

The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the rotational energy depends on the vibrational state.

But perhaps the problem is using the rigid rotor model for simplicity.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both rotational and vibrational quantum numbers change, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy difference comes from the vibrational transition, but the problem subtracts the rotational contribution.

Wait, perhaps the fundamental state is J=0 and v=0, and the next state has J=0 and v=1. So the energy change is h w. So p = (h w)/c =8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and ignoring the vibrational part. But then the answer would still be 3e-31, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which is allowed in the rigid rotor (ΔJ=±2). So the energy change would be E_rot(2) - E_rot(0) = B*(2*3) -0 =6 B.

6B is 6 *4.6e-23 = 2.76e-22 J.

Then p = 2.76e-22 /3e8 =9.2e-31 Ns. Still too small.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum as p = h/(lambda). But lambda = c / f. And f = w/(2 pi), since w=2 pi f.

Wait, maybe the photon's energy is E = h f = h (w/(2 pi)).

So E = (h w)/(2 pi).

Then, p = E/c = (h w)/(2 pi c).

So, let me compute that.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

Divide by 2 pi: 2.65e-19 /6.283 ≈4.207e-19 J.

p =4.207e-19 /3e8 =1.402e-27 Ns.

Hmm, 1.4e-27 Ns is option C (1.1e-27) and option B (2.3e-27) and option D (1.4e-28). Wait, option C is 1.1e-27, which is close but not exactly 1.4e-27.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use E = hc, so p = E/(c).

Wait, no, that's the same as before. So perhaps this approach gives p = (h w)/(2 pi c) → which is (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2 pi *3e8).

Wait, let me compute that:

6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Divide by (2 pi*3e8) → 6.2832 *3e8=1.88496e9.

2.65e-19 /1.88496e9 = approx 1.406e-28 kg m/s → 1.406e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. So that's a match.

So perhaps the correct approach is to compute p = (h w)/(2 pi c) → which gives option D.

But why would that be the case? Oh, because the rotational-vibration coupling might involve factors of 2 pi, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but w is the angular frequency, so when converting to frequency f, f = w/(2 pi).

So E = h f = h (w/(2 pi)).

Then, p = E/c = h w/(2 pi c).

Which is what I did earlier, giving p≈1.4e-28 Ns, which matches option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is modeled as a non-rigid rotor, where both rotational and vibrational energy contributions are considered. The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy state, likely with quantum numbers \( J = 0 \) and \( v = 0 \). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)) or a rotational transition (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)). 

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are quantized as \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \), where \( n \) is the vibrational quantum number. The energy difference for a transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega
   \]  
   Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]  
   This value does not match any of the given options.

2. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are quantized as \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J + 1) \), where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) is the rotational constant, and \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia. The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
   \]  
   Converting \( \mu \) to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):  
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   The bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:  
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \times 4 \times 10^{-20} = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg m}^2
   \]  
   The rotational constant \( B \) is:  
   \[
   B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.207 \times 10^{-46}} = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{2.414 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The energy difference for a transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = B (1)(2) - B (0)(1) = 2B = 2 \times 1.818 \times 10^{-22} = 3.636 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The momentum of the photon is:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{3.636 \times 10^{-22}}{3 \times 10^8} = 1.212 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{Ns}
   \]  
   This value is also far smaller than any of the given options.

3. **Revisiting the Vibrational Transition**:  
   The earlier calculation for the vibrational transition yielded \( p = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \), which is close to option A (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) but not exact. However, if the problem accounts for a factor of \( \frac{1}{2\pi} \) in the energy calculation, the adjusted momentum becomes:  
   \[
   p = \frac{h \omega}{2 \pi c} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14}}{2 \pi \times 3 \times 10^8}
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{6.283 \times 3 \times 10^8} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{1.885 \times 10^9} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]  
   This matches option D (\( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable interpretation of the problem suggests that the photon momentum corresponds to the vibrational transition, adjusted for a factor of \( \frac{1}{2\pi} \). This gives a momentum of \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \), which matches option D.
