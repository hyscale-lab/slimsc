Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the abundance ratios are given using the notation like [Si/Fe], which is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of Si to Fe compared to the Sun. 

So, let's list out the given data. Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun. Wait, no, wait. The [X/Y] notation is log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y) for the Sun. So [Si/Fe] = log (n_Si/n_Fe) - log (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. So if [Si/Fe] is 0.3, then n_Si/n_Fe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that in the Sun.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So the Mg to Si ratio in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times that in the Sun.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, so n_Si in each star compared to each other. Hmm. So I need to find (n_Si)_1 / (n_Si)_2
