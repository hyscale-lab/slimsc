Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions, each starting with different compounds. After performing these reactions and combining the products, the chemist runs the mixture on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

First, I'll break down what each reaction does.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, looking at the structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure has a ketone group (O=C) at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. So, when reduced with LAH, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH-OH group. So, the product from Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, noâ€”wait, wait. Let me think again. LAH would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. So, the starting material is a ketone, so the product is a secondary alcohol. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, the structure is hexan-3-one, so the ketone is on C3. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-... Wait, maybe better to write the structure.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO. So, position 3 is the carbonyl. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one would have 6 carbons, with the ketone on C3. So, it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait
