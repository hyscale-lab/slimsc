Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, each with different formulas.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to assemble the charges. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that probably means its potential is zero, right? Or wait, when a conductor is grounded, it maintains the same potential as the Earth, which is considered zero. So any charges on the sphere would adjust based on the external charge.

So, when you bring a charge q near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere will induce charges on its surface. Because the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will be such that the inner surface will have an opposite charge to q, and the outer surface will have a charge equal to the induced charge, but wait, no, because the sphere is grounded, the outer surface wouldn't have any net charge, or maybe it depends.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. When you place a charge q near a conducting sphere, the sphere's inner surface gets an induced charge of -q (if q is positive) because the conducting material moves electrons to the near side, creating a negative charge there. But since the sphere is grounded, the excess electrons can flow away, so the sphere's overall charge would adjust. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Actually, the presence of the external charge q induces a charge on the conductor. The conductor's inner surface will have a charge of -q, but since the conductor is neutral to begin with (assuming it was initially neutral), the outer surface must have a charge +q to maintain overall neutrality. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: the conductor is grounded, which means it can exchange charges with the Earth. So initially, the sphere has zero net charge. When the charge q is placed nearby, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q (if q is positive), and to maintain neutrality, the outer surface must have +q. But if the sphere is grounded, it can't hold a net charge, so this can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, if the sphere is grounded, any induced charge on the inner surface must be
