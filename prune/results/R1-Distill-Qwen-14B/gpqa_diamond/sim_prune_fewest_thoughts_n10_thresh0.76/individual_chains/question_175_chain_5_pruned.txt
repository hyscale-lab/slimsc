Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates with a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f that depends on λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis.

The question is asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f in terms of λ's dependence.

I remember that in antenna theory and radiation, the radiation pattern of a dipole is a common example. For a dipole radiator, the power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. The maximum intensity occurs at θ = 90 degrees, where sinθ is 1. So, the intensity drops off as θ approaches 0 or 180 degrees.

Wait, but this problem is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal. Hmm, a dipole is a simpler case, but maybe the radiation pattern here is similar. Or is it a different kind of radiator?

Wait, the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillates. If it's a dipole-like oscillator, then the radiation pattern would have that (sinθ)^2 dependence. But if it's a quadrupole or something else, the pattern might be different. But since the question is multiple-choice and the options involve (sin θ)^2, I think it's more likely a dipole scenario.

So, the maximum power A is the maximum intensity. At θ = 30 degrees, what's the fraction of A?

Let me calculate. The intensity pattern for a dipole is I(θ) = I_0 * (sinθ)^2, where I_0 is the maximum intensity at θ = 90 degrees. Wait, no, wait. Actually, for a dipole, the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2, but the maximum occurs at θ=90°, so I_max is I0.

So, the intensity at θ=30° is I
