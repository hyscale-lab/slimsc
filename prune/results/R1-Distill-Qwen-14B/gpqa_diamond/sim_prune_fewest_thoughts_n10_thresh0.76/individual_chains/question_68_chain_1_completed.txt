Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have intrinsic angular momentum, and their magnetic moments are related to that spin. The question says the magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz, where Sz is the z-component of the spin.

So the setup: initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. The particle's moment is aligned with this field, so it's in the lowest energy state for that direction. Then suddenly, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, when the magnetic field is applied along a different axis, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. Before, the Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz, and now it's proportional to Sy. Oh right, because the energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by U = -mu·B. So when the field is along Z, it's proportional to Sz, and when it's along Y, it's proportional to Sy.

So the system was initially in an eigenstate of Sz. When the field switches to Sy, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma B Sy. Or wait, because mu is gamma Sz, but the new field is along Y, so the magnetic moment becomes interacting with Sy. So H = -mu · B, which would be -gamma B Sy.

Wait, the original mu was gamma Sz, right? So when the field is along Y, the interaction term is mu · B = gamma Sz * B_y. But B is along Y, so B_y = B. So H = -gamma B Sz? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is in the Y direction. Oh wait, no, the magnetic moment is a vector. The energy is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field vector.

So when the magnetic field is along Y, the energy is proportional to mu · B = (gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz) · (0, B, 0) )= gamma B Sy. So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to Sy. So H = gamma B Sy? Or wait, with a negative sign? Because U = -mu·B?

Wait, let me think again. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B · S. So if B is in the Y direction, H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, I might have mixed up signs. Let me double-check. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma Sz. So mu = gamma S. Wait, no, wait. For spin, the magnetic moment is usually mu = gamma S, where S is the spin operator. But wait, for electrons, the magnetic moment is mu = -gamma S, because the spin direction is opposite to the magnetic moment. Oh wait, maybe I should just proceed with the given information.

The question says mu = gamma Sz. So mu is in the same direction as Sz. Then the energy U is -mu · B. So when B is along Y, U = -mu · B = -(gamma Sz) · B. Since B is along Y, its components are (0, B, 0). So Sz is the z-component operator, which is a diagonal matrix. So the dot product would involve Sz multiplied by the B's Y component.

Wait, no, the dot product is (mu_x Bx + mu_y By + mu_z Bz). But mu_x is gamma Sx, mu_y is gamma Sy, mu_z is gamma Sz. Oh wait, no, because mu is a vector whose components are gamma times the components of S. So when B is along Y, Bx=0, Bz=0, By=B. So the dot product is mu · B = gamma Sx * 0 + gamma Sy * B + gamma Sz * 0 = gamma B Sy. So H = -mu · B = -gamma B Sy.

So the Hamiltonian after the field is applied along Y is H = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, but what about the units? Oh, well, the exact form might not matter for the frequency calculation; perhaps it's the eigenvalues that are important.

Now, the system was initially in an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was |+z>, the spin-up state in the z-direction. When the Hamiltonian changes to H = -gamma B Sy, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of H. So it will evolve under this new Hamiltonian, leading to time-dependent expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment, which is <Sz>. So we need to find ⟨Sz⟩ as a function of time and determine its frequency.

The time evolution of expectation values can be found using time-dependent perturbation theory, but since the system is two-level, perhaps we can find it exactly.

Wait, the system is spin-1/2, so it has two states, and Sy has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>. The initial state is |+z>.

When the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, the energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of Sy. So the state |+y> has energy E+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) (since Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles). Similarly, |-y> has E- = gamma B (ħ/2).

Wait, wait. Let me be precise. The spin matrices: for spin-1/2, Sx, Sy, Sz have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So Sy has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So if the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy, then the eigenvalues would be E_+ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). So the energies are E_+ = - (gamma B ħ)/2 and E_- = (gamma B ħ)/2.

The initial state is |+z>. Let's express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The states |+y> and |-y> can be written as:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2).

So the initial state is a superposition of the eigenstates of H. So the time evolution of each component can be written as:

|ψ(t)> = (e^(-i E_+ t / ħ) |+y> + e^(-i E_- t / ħ) |-y> ) / sqrt(2)

Plugging in E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = -gamma B ħ / 2 → e^(-i E_+ t / ħ ) = e^(i gamma B t / 2 )
E_- = gamma B ħ / 2 → e^(-i E_- t / ħ ) = e^(-i gamma B t / 2 )

So |ψ(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } |+y> + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is <Sz> = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩.

Let's compute this. Sz is diagonal in the z-basis, so let's express |ψ(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z> to compute the expectation value.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2)

So substitute into |ψ(t)>:

|ψ(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) + e^{ -i gamma B t/2 } (|+z> - |-z>)/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(2)

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) from each term:

= [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)) )

Where theta = gamma B t / 2.

Simplify denominator: sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2.

So,

= [ e^{i theta} (|+z> + |-z> ) + e^{-i theta} (|+z> - |-z> ) ] / 2

Factor out |+z> and |-z>:

= [ (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) |+z> + (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) |-z> ] / 2

Using Euler's formula: e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta} = 2 cos theta, and e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta} = 2i sin theta.

So,

= [ 2 cos theta |+z> + 2i sin theta |-z> ] / 2

Simplify:

= cos theta |+z> + i sin theta |-z>

So, |ψ(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>

Now, compute ⟨Sz⟩ = <ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)>

Sz is diagonal in the z-basis. Sz |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and Sz |-z> = (-ħ/2) |-z>.

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] * Sz * [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ]

Expanding this:

= cos(theta)^2 < +z | Sz | +z > + i cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | Sz | -z > + i sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | Sz | +z > + (i)^2 sin(theta)^2 < -z | Sz | -z >

But Sz is diagonal, so cross terms (like < +z | Sz | -z >) are zero.

So,

= cos(theta)^2 (ħ/2) + (i)(i) sin(theta)^2 (-ħ/2 )

Wait, (i)^2 is -1.

So,

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

Because the second term is (i)(i) sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2 ), which is (-1) sin^2(theta) (-ħ/2 ), wait no:

Wait, the expansion:

i cos(theta) sin(theta) < +z | Sz | -z > → 0.

i sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | Sz | +z > → 0.

Only the first and last terms contribute.

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

Which is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta ), since cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

But theta is gamma B t / 2.

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( 2 * (gamma B t / 2 ) ) = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait. Because mu is gamma Sz, and the question is about the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z = gamma Sz. So <mu_z> = gamma <Sz>.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨Sz⟩ = gamma (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait, the system's oscillation frequency is the frequency of ⟨mu_z⟩ over time. So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = (gamma ħ / 2 ) cos( gamma B t )

The angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, let me check the units. Let me make sure that the frequency is in Hz (s^-1). gamma has units of (rad s^-1)/ (Tesla), perhaps? Or maybe I should think in terms of the Rabi frequency.

Wait, but looking at the options, they have gamma*B multiplied by a factor. So the frequency f would be omega/(2 pi), but the question is about oscillation frequency, which is in terms of angular frequency (omega) or regular frequency (f)?

Wait, the question says 'oscillation frequency' and the options are in terms of gamma*B multiplied by factors. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

So in our calculation, we have ⟨mu_z⟩ oscillating with angular frequency gamma*B. Because cos(gamma B t) has argument gamma B t, so the angular frequency is gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency (angular) is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B. So is that the answer?

Wait, but I thought the oscillation frequency is given by the energy difference divided by hbar. Because the energy levels are E_+ and E_-.

The energy difference between E_- and E_+ is (gamma B ħ/2 ) - ( -gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

The transition frequency is (E_- - E_+) ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ ) / ħ ) = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. So the answer should be option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian changes to $H = -\gamma B S_y$. The system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of the eigenstates of $S_y$, $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:

\[
|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
\]

Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:

\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{i\gamma B t/2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t/2} |-y\rangle \right).
\]

Rewriting $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$:

\[
|+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle),
\]

we find:

\[
|\psi(t)\rangle = \cos(\gamma B t/2)|+z\rangle + i\sin(\gamma B t/2)|-z\rangle.
\]

The expectation value of $S_z$ is:

\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t)| S_z |\psi(t)\rangle.
\]

Expanding this, only the diagonal terms contribute because $S_z$ is diagonal in the $z$-basis. The result is:

\[
\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos^2(\gamma B t/2) - \frac{\hbar}{2} \sin^2(\gamma B t/2) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
\]

Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the expectation value of $\mu_z$ is:

\[
\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
\]

The oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is determined by the argument of the cosine function, which is $\gamma B t$. Thus, the angular frequency of oscillation is $\omega = \gamma B$.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B) $\gamma B$.**
