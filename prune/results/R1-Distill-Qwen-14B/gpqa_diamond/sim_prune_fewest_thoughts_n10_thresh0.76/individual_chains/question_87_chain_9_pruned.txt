Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR and IR questions, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring, right? And the ring itself is 6-membered, so benzene or something similar. But wait, the total carbons are 8? Let me think. Benzene is six carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons in total. So each substituent might be a single carbon or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, wait, di-substituted can't have a substituent that's zero. Hmm.

The IR data shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the compound has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached directly to the aromatic ring. So I'm thinking maybe one substituent is a halide (like Cl or Br) and the other is a carbonyl group, perhaps as an acyl group attached.

Wait, but a carbonyl group could be part of another substituent. So maybe one substituent is -X (like Cl), and the other is something with a carb
