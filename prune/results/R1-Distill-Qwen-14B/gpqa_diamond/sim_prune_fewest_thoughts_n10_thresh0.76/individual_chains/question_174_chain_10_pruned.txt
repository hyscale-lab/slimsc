Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, so let me break it down. The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum must be conserved. That means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

First, let me find the rest masses of the two fragments. The problem states that one is twice as massive as the other. Let me call the smaller mass m, so the larger is 2m. The sum of their rest masses is 3m (since m + 2m = 3m). But the sum is given as 99% of M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99/3) M. So, m = 0.33 M, and the larger fragment is 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait—the initial rest-mass is 300 GeV. So M is 300 GeV/c², but I can ignore the units since they'll probably cancel out.

So the rest masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

But wait, another thing: in reality, when a nucleus undergoes fission, the total rest mass of the fragments is less than the original because some mass is converted into binding energy and kinetic energy. But here the problem says that the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So the initial nucleus had rest mass energy 300 GeV, and the fragments have 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV of rest mass energy. That means 3 GeV went into kinetic energy and other things like binding energy, but perhaps for this problem, we can assume that the kinetic energy comes from that.

Wait, no, because in the problem, the initial nucleus is at rest, and the fission fragments are moving. So the total energy of the system after fission must include the rest mass energy plus their kinetic energies. But since the initial nucleus is at rest, the initial total energy is just its rest mass energy, 300 GeV.

So, after fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus kinetic energies. Let me think.

Let me denote the more massive fragment as having mass 2m (0.66 M) and the lighter as m (0.33 M). Let their velocities be v1 and v2, respectively. But since momentum is conserved, their momenta must be equal and opposite. So, in terms of relativistic momentum, which is gamma*m*v, but wait,
