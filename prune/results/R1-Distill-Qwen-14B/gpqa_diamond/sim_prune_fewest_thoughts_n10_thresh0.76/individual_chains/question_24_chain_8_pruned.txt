Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The problem is about some mixtures undergoing reactions, and I need to find the number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me parse the information:

1. Mixture X is equimolar and consists of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine usually means the presence of double bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which can undergo addition reactions. So the two components in X are probably unsaturated, maybe alkenes or alkynes.

2. When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction, leading to mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. Importantly, Y does not decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the double bonds are saturated or perhaps rearranged, but since Y doesn't react with bromine, they don't have double bonds anymore. So the reaction is likely a hydrogenation or some kind of addition that saturates the double bonds.

3. The reaction is a disproportionation. Hmm, wait. Disproportionation typically involves a single species undergoing both oxidation and reduction. So perhaps one of the components in X is undergoing this. For example, maybe it's something like an alkene that's getting hydrogen added, but that's just hydrogenation. Wait, but if it's a disproportionation, perhaps one component is being oxidized and another is reduced. But wait, the mixture X has two liquids. So maybe one of them is a diene or something that can undergo such a reaction. Alternatively, maybe one of them is a benzene ring compound or something else that can be hydrogenated in a different way.

Wait, but after treatment, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So perhaps the reaction was hydrogenation of double bonds, making single bonds. But that would be hydrogenation, not necessarily a disproportionation. So maybe the reaction is more complex.

Wait, the problem states that when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction. So there's a disproportionation happening here, which leads to Y. So perhaps one of the reactants is being both oxidized and reduced, but how?

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, but I'm not sure. Let's think about what Y is. Y's components don't decolorize bromine, so they probably don't have double bonds. So maybe X's components are alkenes, and the reaction with Pt and heat is hydrogenating them, but in a way that leads to a disproportionation? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is catalytic hydrogenation, which typically adds H2 across double bonds. But if X's mixture is two alkenes, then hydrogenation would produce two alkanes, but the problem says that Y is formed via a disproportionation. So maybe one of the alkenes is being hydrogenated more than the other, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is something else.

Wait, the problem says that after hydrogenation, both X and Y give the same product Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28%. So let me calculate what that hydrogen percentage corresponds to.

Hydrogen's
