Okay, I need to solve this physics problem about the decay of a particle in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are given in meters, with varying exponents.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer when they're moving at relativistic speeds due to time dilation. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when it's moving, the observed lifetime is longer. So the time we measure depends on the Lorentz factor gamma.

The formula I think I need is the time dilation formula: τ = γ * τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), but since the units here are in GeV and GeV/c², I might need to handle that properly.

Wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²), but in natural units where c=1, units are in GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28, which is a bit more than 27. So around 7.9, maybe 7.918.

So gamma is approximately 7.918. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma times tau_0. So τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 7.918 * 8 = 63.344, so 63.344e-16 s, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Now, the lifetime is the time the particle is moving before decaying. But for the Bubble Chamber, I think the question is about the distance the particle travels before decaying, which is the length L = v * τ. Wait, but wait. Since the lifetime is longer due to gamma, the distance is longer by gamma as well.

But wait, another approach. The particle's speed is v, and the lifetime is gamma*tau_0. So the distance is v * gamma tau_0. Alternatively, the distance can be written using beta gamma tau_0, where beta is v/c.

Wait, yes, because L = v * t, where t is the dilated time. And t = gamma tau_0. So L = v * gamma tau_0.

But another way to express it is in terms of beta and gamma. Since beta is v/c, so v = beta c. Thus, L = beta c gamma tau_0. And beta gamma is the same as (E² - m² c^4)^(1/2) / (m c²) )? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, beta gamma can be found from the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), and beta gamma = sqrt(gamma² - 1).

Wait, let's compute beta. Since gamma is 7.918, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Let me compute that. Gamma squared is about 62.7. So 1/gamma^2 is ~0.01596. So 1 - 0.01596 is 0.98404. The square root of that is approximately 0.992. So beta is about 0.992, which is about 0.992c.

Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation is needed, but maybe it's close enough.

So, L = beta * c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but beta gamma is another parameter. Let me compute beta gamma. beta is 0.992, gamma is 7.918, so beta * gamma ≈ 0.992 * 7.918 ≈ 7.852.

So then, L = (beta gamma) * c tau_0. Because L= beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 7.852 * c * 8e-16 s.

Wait, c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So L = 7.852 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute step by step.

7.852 * 8e-16 = 62.816e-16 = 6.2816e-15.

Multiply by 3e8 m/s:

6.2816e-15 * 3e8 = 1.8845e-6 meters. So approximately 1.88e-6 meters.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find the minimum distance such that 30% of the particles decay within that distance. Or, perhaps the minimum is the length needed to have the decay observed.

Wait, the problem statement says: "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?" So I think the resolution refers to the detection capability—meaning, the smallest distance (or largest lifetime) that allows the experiment to see the decay.

Wait, but how is this connected? The lifetime determines how far the particle travels before decaying. If the detector has a certain resolution, then it can only detect decays that happen within a certain region.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the time resolution. But the question mentions resolution in terms of distance, given the options are in meters.

Wait, another approach: The proper lifetime is tau_0, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0 as I calculated. The average distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v gamma tau_0.

But to observe the decay, the particle must travel a distance less than the resolution of the detector. Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution is the length that when the detector's resolution is less than that, you can observe a significant number of decays.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the velocity and the lifetime, but requires figuring out the minimum time resolution, but since the options are in meters, perhaps it's about the minimum length.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: The proper lifetime is tau_0. The observed lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0. The average path length is c * tau * beta, since v = beta c.

Wait, beta is v/c, so v = beta c. So L = v * tau = beta c * gamma tau_0.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Earlier, I computed beta gamma as approximately 7.85, but let me compute it more precisely.

Gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me compute that more accurately. 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 27 -23.87 = 3.13 left. 3.13 / 3.41 ≈ 0.917. So 7.917 is the gamma.

So gamma = 7.917.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let's compute 1/gamma^2: (7.917)^2 is about 62.68. So 1/62.68 ≈ 0.01596. So 1 - 0.01596 = 0.98404. sqrt(0.98404) is approximately 0.9920.

So beta is approximately 0.9920.

Beta gamma is 0.9920 * 7.917 ≈ let's compute:

0.992 * 7 is 6.944, 0.992 * 0.917 ≈ 0.909. So total around 7.853. So beta gamma ≈7.85.

So L = beta gamma c tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 7.85 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Compute 7.85 * 3 = 23.55.

23.55 * 8 = 188.4.

Now, the exponents: 1e8 * 1e-16 = 1e-8.

So 188.4e-8 meters.

Wait, 188.4e-8 m is 1.884e-6 meters. So approximately 1.88e-6 m, which is 1.88 micrometers, I think.

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking back at the options:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 1.88e-6 m. But perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Because 27 /3.41 is perhaps more precise.

27 divided by 3.41. Let's compute 3.41 * 7.918.

3.41 *7 = 23.87.

3.41 *0.918 = let's compute 3.41 *0.9 = 3.069, 3.41 *0.018= 0.06138. Sum is 3.069 +0.06138=3.13038.

So 3.41 *7.918 = approx 23.87 +3.13038=27.00038, which is approximately 27 GeV.

So yes, gamma is approximately 7.918.

So beta gamma is 7.918 * 0.9920. Let's compute that precisely.

7.918 * 0.9920.

Compute 7.918 * (1 - 0.008) = 7.918 - 7.918 *0.008.

7.918 *0.008=0.063344.

So 7.918 - 0.063344=7.854656.

So beta gamma =7.854656.

So L =7.854656 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.854656 *3 =23.563968.

Multiply by 8: 23.563968 *8=188.511744.

So 188.511744e-8 meters.

Wait, because 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8? Wait wait, 3e8 is 3*1e8, 8e-16 is 8*1e-16.

Multiply 3 *8=24, exponents 1e8 *1e-16=1e-8. So 24e-8 m.

24e-8 is 2.4e-7 meters. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when multiplied by 7.854656.

Wait wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.

Wait, L = beta gamma * c * tau_0.

beta gamma is about 7.854656.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L =7.854656 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Multiply 7.854656 *3 =23.563968.

23.563968 *8e-16 = 188.511744e-16.

Wait, but the units are 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s = (3e8)*(8e-16) m =24e-8 m.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 meters. Which is 2.4e-7 meters.

But then 2.4e-7 m multiplied by beta gamma? Wait, no, beta gamma is a dimensionless factor.

Wait, no, L = beta gamma * (c tau_0).

Wait, that's (beta gamma) * (c * tau_0).

So c tau_0 is 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m.

So L =7.854656 * 2.4e-7 m.

Compute 7.854656 *2.4e-7.

7.854656 *2.4 = about 18.8511744.

So 18.85e-7 m =1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers. But my calculation gives around 1.88e-6 m. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Gamma = E/(m c²) but in natural units, if E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV/c², then gamma is E/(m) =27/3.41.

Calculate 27 divided by 3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87, 27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = approximately 0.9179.

So gamma is 7.9179.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact values.

But perhaps I should compute beta more accurately.

gamma =7.9179.

beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

Compute gamma^2: 7.9179^2.

Let me compute 7.9^2 =62.41.

7.9179 squared: (7.9179)^2.

Compute 7 *7 =49, 7 *0.9179 *2= 12.8506, 0.9179^2≈0.8424.

So 49 +12.8506 +0.8424=62.693. So gamma^2 ≈62.693.

So 1/gamma^2=1/62.693≈0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405) is approx 0.9920.

Wait, but perhaps compute it more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.98405). Let me think, 0.99^2 is 0.9801. 0.992^2= (0.99)^2 + 2*0.99*0.002 + (0.002)^2 = 0.9801 + 0.00396 + 0.000004= 0.984064. Oh, that's very close to 0.98405.

So sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.9920.

So beta is approximately 0.9920.

So beta gamma is 0.9920 *7.9179≈7.854.

So L is 7.854 * c * tau_0.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So c tau_0 is 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.854: 2.4e-7 *7.854 ≈ 18.85e-7 m=1.885e-6 m.

Again, about 1.885 micrometers.

Wait, but the options don't have that. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me check if I should have used different values.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma=27/3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87, 27-23.87=3.13.

3.13/3.41=0.9179.

So total gamma=7.9179.

But perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 3.41 *7.9179=?

3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *0.9179=?

Compute 3.41 *0.9=3.069.

3.41 *0.0179= approx 0.0609.

So sum is 3.069 +0.0609=3.1299.

So 23.87 +3.1299=26.9999, which is ~27. So yes, gamma is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the minimum resolution to observe 30% of the decays. So perhaps the average length is 1.88e-6 m, but to observe at least 30% of the decays, perhaps I need to have the detector's resolution (the smallest length it can detect) less than or equal to 30% of that? Or perhaps the decay length must be more than a certain amount for 30% of the decays to be detected.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum resolution (i.e., the minimum detectable length) such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So the minimum length L_min is such that the probability of the decay occurring within L_min is 30%.

The decay follows an exponential distribution: the probability that the decay occurs after time t is exp(-t/tau). The distance L is v * t, so t = L/(v).

So the probability that the decay occurs within L is P = 1 - exp(-L/(v tau)).

Wait, v is beta c, so L/(v tau) = L/(beta c tau). But tau is gamma tau_0, so substituting, L/(beta c gamma tau_0).

But beta gamma is approximately 7.854, as before. So L/(beta c gamma tau_0) = L/(7.854 c tau_0).

But c tau_0 is 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

So 7.854 * 2.4e-7 m = about 1.885e-6 m.

Wait, no. Wait, 7.854 * (c tau_0) =7.854 * 2.4e-7 m =1.885e-6 m.

So L/(beta c gamma tau_0) = L/(1.885e-6 m) * (1/(c tau_0)) ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the expression.

The probability P that the decay occurs within a distance L is P = 1 - exp(-L/(beta c gamma tau_0)).

We want P >= 0.3.

So 0.3 =1 - exp(-x), where x = L/(beta c gamma tau_0).

So exp(-x) = 0.7.

Take natural log: -x = ln(0.7) ≈-0.35667.

So x≈0.35667.

So x = L/(beta c gamma tau_0) =0.35667.

Thus, L =0.35667 * beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, but beta c gamma tau_0 is the same as L_avg, the average decay length. Which we calculated as 1.885e-6 m.

Wait, no, beta c gamma tau_0 is indeed the average decay length, as earlier.

So L =0.35667 * average L.

So 0.35667 *1.885e-6 = let's compute that.

0.35667 *1.885 ≈0.673.

So 0.673e-6 m =6.73e-7 m.

Wait, but that's the L_min such that 30% of the decays are observed.

Wait, but that's not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the average decay length is lambda= beta gamma c tau_0 =1.885e-6 m.

The decay length distribution is exponential, so the probability that the decay occurs within a length L is P=1 - exp(-L/lambda).

We set P=0.3. So 0.3=1-exp(-L/lambda).

Thus, exp(-L/lambda)=0.7 → L/lambda= -ln(0.7) ≈0.35667.

So L=0.35667 * lambda = 0.35667 *1.885e-6 m.

Compute 0.35667 *1.885e-6.

1.885e-6 *0.35667≈ let's compute 1.885 *0.35667≈0.673.

So 0.673e-6 meters, which is 6.73e-7 m → 673 nm.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 1e-6 m (micrometers), so none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used beta gamma c tau_0, which is lambda, and the required L is 0.35667 * lambda.

Wait, but that gives 6.73e-7 m, which is 673 nm, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I have misunderstood the question. Maybe the "minimum resolution" refers to the time resolution, but the options are in meters, so perhaps I should think of the distance as the minimum detectable length, and the probability is about 30% of decays being within that length.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the length that 30% of the decays are within that length. So the length L such that P=0.3.

Which we found L≈0.35667 *lambda ≈0.35667 *1.885e-6 m≈6.73e-7 m. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the mean lifetime gamma tau_0, and the distance beta c gamma tau_0. Hmm, but that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the minimum length that 30% are within, but the minimum detectable length which allows 30% of the decays to be observed. So perhaps the minimum L is such that the average distance is 30% of L? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the time resolution. The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, and the time resolution must be such that 30% of the decays are observed within that time. But the options are in meters, not seconds.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the proper lifetime. The time it takes for the particle to decay in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. The distance it travels is v * gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the problem is about the time resolution. To observe the decay, the detector must have a time resolution good enough to detect the decay within the time tau = gamma tau_0. But the options are in meters, so I think it's about the distance.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying, such that at least 30% of the decays are observed within that distance. So, using the decay probability, L is such that P=30%.

As I calculated, L=0.35667 *lambda=0.35667 *1.885e-6 m≈6.73e-7 m.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I've made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering relativistic particles and using the mean lifetime but not considering the velocity properly.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires using the speed of light multiplied by the proper lifetime, but that would be for a non-moving particle, which isn't the case.

Wait, but wait, let me think again about the expression for the average decay length.

L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

So that's correct. So beta is about 0.992, gamma is ~7.9179, c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L_avg =0.992 *7.9179 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 0.992 *7.9179=7.854.

3e8 *8e-16=24e-8 m.

7.854 *24e-8 m=188.5e-8 m=1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. The closest is option A)2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, let's compute gamma precisely.

gamma =27 /3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 =0.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

Hmm, perhaps the question is using the velocity as c, not beta c. But no, that would give a longer distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the speed as v= c, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should compute L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Wait, beta is v/c, so v= beta c.

So L= v gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the calculation of beta gamma again.

Wait, gamma =7.9179.

beta= sqrt(1-1/gamma^2)= sqrt(1 -1/(7.9179)^2)= sqrt(1-1/62.685).

1/62.685≈0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So beta gamma=7.9179 *0.9920=7.854.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation is correct. So the average length is 1.885e-6 m. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the speed as c, not beta c.

If I compute L= c * gamma tau_0.

So gamma tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L=3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s=1.9002e-6 m=1.90e-6 m.

That's closer to option A)2.08e-6 m.

But why would the question use c instead of beta c? Because beta is close to 1, so it's almost the same.

Wait, but if I compute L= c * gamma tau_0.

But that would be (3e8 m/s) * (7.9179 *8e-16 s).

Compute 7.9179 *8=63.3432.

63.3432e-16 s =6.33432e-15 s.

Multiply by 3e8 m/s: 6.33432e-15 *3e8 =1.9003e-6 m=1.9003e-6 m.

That's about 1.90e-6 m, which is still not matching option A.

Wait, but perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of velocity. No, the options are in meters.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as c without considering beta. But that would give a longer length than reality.

Wait, but let me think about the formula again.

The proper lifetime is tau_0.

The lifetime observed is gamma tau_0.

The average distance is v * gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is beta gamma c tau_0.

So perhaps the correct calculation is as I did before, leading to 1.88e-6 m.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I should check if I have the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum time resolution. If the detector's time resolution is too poor, it can't resolve the decay time, so it can't observe the decay. The time resolution must be at least such that a fraction of the decays are within the time window.

But the options are in meters, so perhaps it's not about time.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the speed of the particle.

E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

Wait, but perhaps using units where c=1.

So E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV.

So p c = sqrt(27² -3.41²) = sqrt(729 - 11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=approx 26.78 GeV.

So p=26.78 GeV/c.

The velocity beta is p c / E. So beta = (26.78 GeV/c) / 27 GeV) = 26.78/27 ≈0.99185. Close to what I had before.

So beta ≈0.99185.

Gamma is E/(m c²) =27/3.41≈7.9179.

So beta gamma =0.99185 *7.9179≈7.85.

So average decay length L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

Tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L_avg=7.85 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8 m.

7.85 *24e-8=188.4e-8=1.884e-6 m.

Again, 1.884e-6 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at option B: 2.08e-9 m, which is 2.08 nanometers. That's way too small. Option A is 2.08e-6 m (micrometers), which is close but a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation once more.

Another approach: Let's compute beta and gamma precisely.

Compute gamma:

gamma =E / (m c²) =27 GeV / 3.41 GeV =27/3.41 ≈7.9179.

Compute beta:

beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )= sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

So beta gamma =7.9179 * 0.9920≈7.854.

L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L_avg =7.854 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m.

Multiply by 7.854:

7.854 *24e-8 =188.496e-8 m=1.88496e-6 m≈1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, which is about 1.885 micrometers.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the proper time and not considering gamma. But that would give L = v tau_0 = beta c tau_0 =0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

2.976e8 *8e-16=2.3808e-7 m=2.38e-7 m, which is 238 nm. Not any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if the calculation is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the mean path length, and the options are using a different approach.

Wait, another idea: The resolution required is the minimum distance such that a certain fraction of the decays are observed. If the detector's resolution is the minimum detectable path length, then to observe 30% of the decays, the average path length must be greater than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum possible resolution, which would be the maximum possible decay length. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mean free path. The mean free path is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So if the detector can resolve up to the mean free path, it can observe a certain fraction.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Since my calculation leads to approximately 1.88e-6 m, but the options have A)2.08e-6 m, perhaps the correct answer is A. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute the calculation using exact numbers.

Compute gamma =27 /3.41.

3.41 *7 =23.87, 27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 =0.9179.

So gamma=7.9179.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (3.41/27)^2 )=sqrt(1 - (0.1263)^2 )=sqrt(1-0.01595)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

Compute beta gamma=7.9179 *0.9920=7.854.

c tau_0=3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

L=7.854 *2.4e-7 m=1.885e-6 m.

So the correct answer should be approximately 1.885e-6 m, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is A)2.08e-6 m. But why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute 27 /3.41 accurately.

3.41 *7.9179= 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41 *0.9179=3.130.

Total is 23.87 +3.130=26.9999, which is 27. So correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for c. c is approximately 2.99792e8 m/s.

Let me recalculate L_avg using precise c.

c=2.99792e8 m/s.

gamma=7.9179.

beta=0.9920.

L_avg = beta gamma c tau_0.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So:

beta gamma =7.854.

c=2.99792e8 m/s.

Compute 7.854 *2.99792e8 *8e-16.

First, 2.99792e8 *8e-16 =2.398336e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.854: 2.398336e-7 *7.854 ≈ 1.8857e-6 m.

Still about 1.8857e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the calculation using the mean path length.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the time a particle lives in the lab frame and how that relates to the distance traveled. But I'm back to the same calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum distance that the particle travels so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. That is, P=0.3.

So, using P=1-exp(-L/(L_avg)).

Set P=0.3 →0.3=1-exp(-L/(L_avg)) → exp(-L/(L_avg))=0.7 → L/(L_avg)= -ln(0.7)=0.35667.

So L=0.35667 * L_avg=0.35667 * 1.885e-6 m=6.73e-7 m.

But that's 673 nm, which is 6.73e-7 m, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the question is simply asking for the average decay length, which is 1.88e-6 m. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the speed as c, not beta c.

In that case, L= c * gamma tau_0.

gamma tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L=3e8 *6.334e-15=1.9002e-6 m=1.90e-6 m.

That's approximately 1.9e-6 m, which is close to option A)2.08e-6 m. Perhaps the problem expects that approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the speed as c. But that's incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the problem has a different approach. Let me think about the energy and mass.

The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. Energy is 27 GeV. So the kinetic energy is 27-3.41=23.59 GeV.

The total energy is 27 GeV.

The relativistic energy is E=gamma m c² → gamma=E/(m c²)=27 /3.41=7.9179.

So beta= sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²) )= sqrt(1 - (3.41²)/(27²) )=sqrt(1 - (11.6281)/(729))=sqrt(1-0.01595)=0.992.

So beta=0.992.

The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0=7.9179 *8e-16=6.3343e-15 s.

The distance is v * tau= beta c * gamma tau_0.

Which is the same as before.

So L= beta c gamma tau_0=0.992 *3e8 *8e-16 *7.9179.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the formula is L= beta c * gamma tau_0.

Which is 0.992 *3e8 m/s *7.9179 *8e-16 s.

Wait, no, no. L= beta c * (gamma tau_0).

Gamma tau_0 is 6.334e-15 s.

So L=0.992 *3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s.

0.992 *3e8=2.976e8 m/s.

2.976e8 *6.334e-15= (2.976 *6.334) *1e-7.

Compute 2.976 *6.334 ≈18.85.

So L≈18.85e-7 m=1.885e-6 m.

Same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering the velocity as c, so beta=1.

In that case, L= c * gamma tau_0.

So L=3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s=1.9002e-6 m=1.90e-6 m.

Which is about 1.90 micrometers. Again, close to option A.

So perhaps the intended answer is option A)2.08e-6 m. But I'm not sure why, unless I'm missing a step.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the problem is using the mean path length, but the calculation is done with beta=1.

So L= c gamma tau_0=3e8 m/s *7.9179 *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.9179 *8=63.3432.

3e8 *63.3432e-16=1.9003e-6 m.

Wait, that's 1.90e-6 m, which is still not option A.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to compute gamma as (E + m c²)/m c², but that would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the total energy E=gamma m c², so gamma=E/(m c²)=27/(3.41)=7.9179.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the energy is given per particle, but perhaps the velocity is calculated using E=gamma m c², so beta= sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)).

But that's what I did earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely sure.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of $X^0 \rightarrow Y^+ Z^-$ in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process using relativistic time dilation and exponential decay principles.

### Key Information:
- **Proper lifetime of $X^0$**: $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$  
- **Energy of $X^0$**: $E = 27 \, \text{GeV}$  
- **Mass of $X^0$**: $m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV}/c^2$  
- **Speed of light**: $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$  

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor $\gamma$
The Lorentz factor is given by:  
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]  
In natural units where $c = 1$, this simplifies to:  
\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.9179
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity $\beta$
The velocity $\beta$ is related to $\gamma$ by:  
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]  
Substituting $\gamma \approx 7.9179$:  
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(7.9179)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{62.685}} = \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.9920
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the observed lifetime $\tau$
The observed lifetime in the lab frame is:  
\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0
\]  
Substituting $\gamma \approx 7.9179$ and $\tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s}$:  
\[
\tau = 7.9179 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average decay length $L_{\text{avg}}$
The average distance traveled by the particle before decaying is:  
\[
L_{\text{avg}} = \beta c \tau
\]  
Substituting $\beta \approx 0.9920$, $c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$, and $\tau \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}$:  
\[
L_{\text{avg}} = 0.9920 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]  
\[
L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (1.885 \, \mu\text{m})
\]

### Step 5: Determine the minimum resolution
To observe at least 30% of the decays, the minimum resolution corresponds to the length $L$ such that 30% of the decays occur within this distance. The probability of a decay occurring within a distance $L$ is given by:  
\[
P = 1 - e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}}
\]  
Setting $P = 0.3$:  
\[
0.3 = 1 - e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}} \implies e^{-L / L_{\text{avg}}} = 0.7
\]  
Taking the natural logarithm:  
\[
-\frac{L}{L_{\text{avg}}} = \ln(0.7) \implies \frac{L}{L_{\text{avg}}} = -\ln(0.7) \approx 0.35667
\]  
Thus:  
\[
L = 0.35667 \times L_{\text{avg}} \approx 0.35667 \times 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \approx 6.73 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
\]  
This result (673 nm) does not match any of the provided options.

### Step 6: Reassess the options
The closest option to the calculated average decay length $L_{\text{avg}} \approx 1.885 \, \mu\text{m}$ is **A) $2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$**. Given the approximations and potential rounding in the problem setup, this is likely the intended answer.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
