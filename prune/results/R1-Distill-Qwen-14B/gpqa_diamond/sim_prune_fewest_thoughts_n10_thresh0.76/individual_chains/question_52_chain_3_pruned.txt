Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels.

Alright, let's read the problem again. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Because dark spots are cooler, right? So when the spots cover part of the star, the overall observed temperature would be lower than when the spots aren't present.

But wait, the problem says when the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, the Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered, the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Hmm, I think effective temperature is a sort of average. So maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, and the rest is at 6000 K. But the problem doesn't give the spot's temperature, though. Hmm. But wait, the main point is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels.

In the photosphere, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 is observed. When spots are present, the ratio decreases. So they're looking for the factor by which this ratio changes: (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = ?

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 is higher than E1, so E2-E1 is positive.

So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2-E1.

Wait, but when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is lower. So T is 5500 K in that case. Without spots
