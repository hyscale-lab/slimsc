Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given. Let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out what reagents A and B are.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. It's a ketone. Reacting it with NaCN. I remember that in the presence of a suitable acid, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN provides the cyanide ion as a nucleophile.

Wait, but wait. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide nucleophile, it's typically under certain conditions. I think that for the nucleophilic addition of CN- to a ketone, we usually need an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is an acid), to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. That would help the CN- attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the ketone (butan-2-one) has added a cyanide and a hydroxyl group. That makes sense because the cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the proton from the acid adds to the oxygen, leading to a hydroxyl group after the workup.

So, reagent A is probably H3O+ because that's the acid catalyst for the addition of CN- to the ketone.

Now looking at the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (and water) to form an acid. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, they typically form carboxylic acids, while in basic conditions, they form carboxylate salts, which are then acidified to get the carboxylic acid.

But in this case, the reaction conditions include H2O and reagent B. So probably, the nitrile is undergoing hydrolysis. The reagent B would be an acid catalyst because the product is a carboxylic acid, not a salt.

Wait, but looking at the starting material, it's a nitrile attached to a hydroxyl group. So the molecule is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with a benzyl group substituent. When the nitrile is hydrolyzed, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So the reaction is probably under acidic hydrolysis conditions.

The typical reagents for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids are H2O and an acid catalyst, like HCl or H3O+ (which is HCl in water, perhaps). Alternatively, sometimes it's done with H2SO4 as the catalyst.

Wait, but in the options, B is one of the choices. Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So in the second reaction, the reagent B is either
