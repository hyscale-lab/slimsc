Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, and neutrinos are a byproduct of these reactions.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun, and it has a few branches. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce different amounts of neutrinos. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the others. But wait, I think the majority of the Sun's neutrinos come from the pp-I branch. Because the pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing about 86% of the Sun's energy, I believe.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So that means no more neutrinos from that branch are being produced. But since neutrinos travel at nearly the speed of light, 8.5 minutes is about the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, the pp-III branch has stopped, so the neutrinos from that source that were produced before the stoppage are still on their way. So the neutrino flux we're detecting now would be affected.

I need to find the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, we
