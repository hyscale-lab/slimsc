Alright, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, the setup is about a conductor with a cavity and some charges inside. I remember from my notes that conductors have some specific properties when it comes to electric fields and charges.

So the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. Now, the question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and we know l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So the geometry here is a bit tricky, but let's see.

I remember that when a conductor is uncharged, it has no net charge. But when you place a charge inside a cavity, charges redistribute on the conductor's surfaces. Wait, but in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we put +q inside the cavity, the conductor must respond.

Wait, I think that the cavity is inside the conductor. So the charge +q will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since it's a conductor, the charges will redistribute themselves. The inner surface would have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the +q attracts electrons to the inner surface. But since the conductor was initially uncharged, those electrons come from the conductor's bulk. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must then have +q to balance, because the total conductor's charge is zero. Wait, no, wait. The conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, but wait, the conductor is neutral, and the cavity has +q. So the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor
