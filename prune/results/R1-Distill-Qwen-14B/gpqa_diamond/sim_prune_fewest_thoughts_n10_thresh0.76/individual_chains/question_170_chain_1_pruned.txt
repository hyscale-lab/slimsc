Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). Oh right, that's a two-component vector, probably in the basis of spin-up and spin-down states. So the state is a column vector χ = [3i, 4]^T. Or wait, sometimes the notation is row vectors, but I think for spin states, it's usually column vectors. So yeah, χ is a column vector with elements 3i and 4.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Or wait, is it ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩? Yeah, I think that's right. Because the expectation value is the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state.

But wait, S_y is the spin operator along y. I remember that for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and the spin operators are (ħ/2) times each of them.

So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. And σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

So let me write that out. σ_y is a
