Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it can form complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so the metal is more tightly bound.

The problem says the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I guess I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, how does the formation constant relate to the concentration of the ions? Oh right, the formation constant K is given by the formula:

K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

But wait, in this case, the solution is just the complex, so initially, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA are zero. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The complex is Ca-EDTA, which is a 1:1 complex. So, when it dissociates, each mole of the complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, if the complex is [CaEDTA]^n, let's say the concentration is C. Then, when it dissociates, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would both be equal to x, assuming that x is small compared to C. Because K is large, the complex is stable, so x would be small.

Wait, but wait. The formation constant K is given, so I can write the expression for K in terms of the concentrations. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but as it dissociates, some of it breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let me let s be the amount of complex that
