Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what value the algorithm assigns to the DNA sequence ACAGTGACC. The given examples are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm, I wonder how the algorithm works. Let's think about possible ways DNA sequences could translate into numbers.

First, I'll list out the inputs and outputs again to see if I can spot a pattern. 

AGG is a 3-base pair sequence, and it outputs 115. TGCTGA is 6 bases and gives 176. The target is ACAGTGACC, which is 9 bases. So maybe the algorithm processes each base and sums something up.

Let me think about the individual bases. In DNA, the bases are A, T, C, G. Each has a numerical value perhaps? Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4 or something. Or maybe they're assigned different values. Let me test that.

For AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. So 1+4+4=9. But the output is 115. That doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe it's not just a simple sum. What if each base contributes a value, perhaps multiplied by its position or something else.

Wait, maybe each base is multiplied by a certain factor. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe each base is converted to its ASCII value and then summed.

Wait, the ASCII values for A, T, C, G. Let's check:

A is 65, T is 84, C is 67, G is 71. 

Let me test the first example: AGG. So A=65, G=71, G=71. Sum: 65+71+71 = 207. But the output is 115, so that doesn't fit. Maybe it's not the sum of ASCII values.

Another possibility: Maybe each base is assigned a certain numerical value, like A=1, C=2, G=3, T=4. Let's see. Then AGG would be 1 +3 +3 =7. Not 115. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the algorithm is converting each nucleotide to a binary code. Let's think about the binary representations. For example, A, T, C, G could be represented as 00, 01, 10, 11 in some coding. But not sure. Let me see:

AGG would be A (00), G (11), G (11). Concatenating gives 001111. That's 15 in decimal. But output is 115. Not matching. Hmm.

Wait another angle: Maybe it's the sum of the number of each base in the sequence. For AGG, A=1, G=2. So 1+2=3. Output is 115. No, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe each base's value is its position in the alphabet. A=1, T=20, C=3, G=7. Let's calculate AGG: 1 +7 +7 =15. No, output is 115. Doesn't
