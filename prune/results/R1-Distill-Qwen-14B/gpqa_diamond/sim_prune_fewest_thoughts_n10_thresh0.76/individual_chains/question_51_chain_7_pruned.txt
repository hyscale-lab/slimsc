Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

Alright, the setup: There's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. And we need to find the potential energy of this system. The options are all different expressions involving k, q squared, R, and d.

Wait, so the sphere is grounded. I remember that a grounded conductor means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge can flow in or out. But wait, if the charge is placed near the sphere, how does that affect things?

The conducting sphere's properties come into play. Conducting spheres have charges on their surfaces, and when they're isolated, the charge resides on the outer surface. But since it's grounded, any induced charges can adjust. Wait, but if the sphere is grounded, when a charge is placed near it, the sphere can allow charges to move in or out to maintain neutral. Hmm, no, wait. If the sphere is neutral initially, and you bring a charge near it, the sphere's electrons will redistribute, but since it's grounded, it can't hold excess charge. So, the sphere remains neutral overall, but there will be induced charges on its surface.

Wait, but the problem says it's a grounded conducting sphere. So, when you bring a charge q near it, the sphere's free charges will respond. Because the sphere is conducting, the induced charges will arrange themselves on the surface. But since it's grounded, the sphere's net charge remains zero? Or does the presence of the external charge induce a separation of charges on the sphere, which can then flow into the ground?

Wait, no. Let me think again. A grounded conductor allows charges to move freely, so any induced charges will cause current until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. But when you bring a charge near the sphere, the sphere's electrons will be attracted or repelled. If q is positive, electrons (negative) in the sphere will be attracted to the near side of the sphere, leaving positive charges on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, electrons can flow into the ground, and positive charges can't accumulate. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify.

Wait, in a grounded conductor, any excess charge would flow away, but in this case, the sphere
