Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the quantum mechanics stuff. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, I think the next state would be the first excited state, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alright, let's read the given data again. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. So the options are choices for the photon's momentum.

Wait, wait. The question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that's the first excited state. But in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states are quantized in terms of both vibrational and rotational energy. So the molecule's energy is a combination of both.

But the question is about the absorbed photon's momentum. I remember that photons carry energy and momentum. The energy of the photon would have to match the energy difference between the two states. Oh right, the energy of a photon is E = hν, and the momentum p = E/c, since E = pc for photons.

So, to find the momentum, I need to find the energy difference between the two states and then compute p = ΔE / c.

Wait, but what states are we transitioning between? The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. The next state would be the first excited state. But how does that work in the rotation-vibration model?

I'm a bit confused. The fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational energy. So the next state could be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. But the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, wait, that suggests the transition with the least energy required. So maybe it's the first possible transition where the energy is just enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the lowest rotational state. When it absorbs a photon, it could
