Okay, so I've got this question about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy. The options are A to D, each a power of ten.

Wait, right, the event horizon's angular size relates to its size. The formula I think I remember is θ ≈ (size) / distance. Oh wait, more accurately, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance when θ is small, which it is here.

So the size of the event horizon would be θ * d. Let me get the units straight. θ is in degrees, but I need to convert it to radians because the small angle approximation (θ ≈ opposite/adjacent) uses radians.

Converting θ from degrees to radians: 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_radians = θ_degrees * π / 180.

Given θ = 1e-17 degrees, so θ_radians is 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that approximately. Let's see, π is about 3.14, so 3.14/180 is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 is about 1.745e-19 radians.

The size (let's call it R) is then θ * d. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I should convert parsecs to meters because entropy formulas probably use SI units.

Wait, how many meters are in a parsec? I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So d in meters is 1e10 * 3.0857e16 = 3.0857e26 meters.

So R = θ_rad * d = 1.745e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m.

Calculating that: 1.7
