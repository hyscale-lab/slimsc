Okay, so I've got this physics problem here from CERN's Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about particle decay and the resolution needed in the detector. Okay, I remember that when a particle decays, the lifetime of the particle affects how far its decay products can travel before being detected. 

The question says X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. We need to find the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, what does that mean again? Oh, right, the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products' paths. So the longer the decay path, the easier it is to see the decay, but if the path is too short, the particles might not be resolvable. 

I think I need to find the average decay length first. The decay length is how far the X⁰ travels before decaying. The formula for decay length L is c multiplied by τ₀ multiplied by the velocity (βc) of the particle. 

Wait, but first, I should calculate the velocity of X⁰. Since the particle has a certain energy, which is given as 27 GeV. But the rest mass is 3.41 GeV. Oh right, because the kinetic energy is much higher than the rest mass energy, the particle is moving at a speed close to the speed of light. But maybe we can approximate β as being approximately 1, but perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

The energy E is given by the relativistic formula E = γ m c². The rest mass m is 3.41 GeV/c². Wait, but the units can be tricky. Let me think. Since E is in GeV, and m is also in GeV/c², perhaps I can work in natural units where c=1. So E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Hmm, but maybe it's easier to compute the gamma factor γ.

Gamma is E/(m c²). So E is 27 GeV, and m c² is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. That's a gamma of about 7.917. 

Then, the velocity beta (β) can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Wait, wait, no. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Let me compute that. 

Gamma is approximately 7.917, so gamma squared is about 62.7. Then 1/gamma² is ~0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405. The square root of that is around 0.992, because 0.992² is approximately 0.984.
