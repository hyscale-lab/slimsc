Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complex. Let me try to visualize it. It seems like a molecule with two double bonds, maybe something like a diene or a polyene structure.

The problem gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. I remember that the enthalpy of formation of a molecule can be calculated using bond energies. The idea is to take the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (like elements in their standard states) and subtract the energy released when the bonds form in the product.

Wait, the formula I think is: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products). Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the reactants are the elements (like H2 and C) and the products are the bonds in the molecule. So it's sum of bonds broken minus sum of bonds formed.

But wait, the problem gives bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, H-H, and the atomization energy of carbon. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element (like C in graphite or diamond) into isolated atoms. So I think for each carbon atom, I have to use the atomization energy.

Let me think. For each molecule, I need to calculate the total energy of the bonds in the molecule, then subtract that from the energy required to break down the elements into their constituent atoms.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the formula:

ΔHf = [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds)] - [Σ (bond energies of product bonds)]

But wait, more accurately, the reactants are the elements in their standard states, and the product is the molecule. So, the process is:

Elements (as atoms) → Molecule.

But when you form the molecule, you're making new bonds. So the energy released is the sum of the bond energies of the molecule's bonds, because bond formation releases energy.

Wait, but the way the formula works is:

ΔHf = sum (bonds broken in reactants) - sum (bonds formed in products)

Wait, no, the way I remember it is:

ΔH
