Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times bigger. The question is about their luminosities. Hmm, right, luminosity is how much light a star emits.

The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength... Oh, right, that's the blackbody radiation peak. Wien's Law says that lambda_max is proportional to temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Or wait, because Wien's Law is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same, T is the same for both stars. That makes sense.

So both stars have the same temperature. But wait, the stars' masses and radii are different. How does that tie in? Well, I remember that the luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Since both stars have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities would just be the ratio of (R_1² / R_2²), because T cancels out. Wait, but wait, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² is (1.5)^2 * R2² = 2.25 R2². So L1/L2 would be (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4). Since T1=T2, it's (R1/R2)^2. So (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, that's option A.

But wait, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of... So the ratio is L1/L2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, which is option A. But wait, what about
