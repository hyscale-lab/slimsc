Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs), so plx = 1/distance.

But wait, stars uniformly distributed—does that mean the number of stars in a certain volume is uniform? Oh, yeah, if they're uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars depends on the volume of space you're considering.

So, for a given range of parallax, how does that translate to distance? Parallax plx is 1/d, so a change in plx would correspond to a change in d. Let me think about differential relationships.

If plx is small, like for very distant stars, a small change in plx would mean a large change in distance. Because plx is inversely proportional to d, so d = 1/plx. The differential of d with respect to plx would be dd = (1/plx²) dplx. So, a small change in plx (dplx) would give a bigger change in d when plx is small. But how does that relate to the number of stars?

The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would be proportional to the
