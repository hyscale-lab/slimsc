Alright, I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. Okay, so the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I remember that acetates are esters, right? So the structure would generally be something like R-O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, wait. Wait, acetate is an ester where the R group is acetyl (from acetic acid). So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So the main groups to look for would be the ester carbonyl and the R group attached to the oxygen.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Let me break down each part. 

Starting with the 2.1 ppm singlet integrating for 3H. Singlet suggests no neighboring protons. The only group that fits this is a methyl group attached to something that's not causing splitting. Since we're dealing with acetates, this must be the acetyl group (COOCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-CH3. So the methyl group (CH3) attached to the carbonyl would be at around 2.1 ppm. So that's the methyl from the acetyl group. So the 2.1 ppm peak is the acetyl methyl. That makes sense.

Then the next peak is 1.6 ppm (3H, d). A doublet here suggests that the proton is coupled to one neighboring proton. So this is likely a methyl group attached to a CH. Maybe it's a CH2CH2 group? Wait, wait, perhaps it's part of a vinyl group. For example, in an allyl group or something like that. So maybe this is a CH2 group where one of the H's is a doublet. Hmm.

Wait, the 5.5 ppm region is a doublet of quadruplets? Or doublet with something else. Wait, the description says
