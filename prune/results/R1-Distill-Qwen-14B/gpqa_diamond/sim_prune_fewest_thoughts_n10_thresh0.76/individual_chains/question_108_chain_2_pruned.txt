Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. They mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I'm a bit fuzzy on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I remember that in hydrogen atoms, electrons can transition between energy levels, which emits or absorbs photons. The energy difference between these levels is ΔE, and the transition corresponds to a specific wavelength. Here, the wavelength is given as 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that rings a bell. Isn't that around the wavelength for the Balmer series? Like the hydrogen Balmer-alpha line, which is about 656 nm, but wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486 nm, which I think is the Balmer-beta line. Anyway, maybe the exact transition isn't crucial right now.

The problem asks to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with ΔE. So I need to figure out what each of these terms represents and then estimate their magnitudes.

Let me think about the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction between an atom's magnetic moments and an external magnetic field. In the case of an atom in a magnetic field, the energy of the system due to the magnetic interaction is given by the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait a second—the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, not m_s. Oh, but maybe I'm mixing up orbital and spin here. The paramagnetic coupling is usually due to spin-orbit interaction, but wait no, wait, paramagnetism comes from the spin of the electron. Oh right, because the orbital contribution is diamagnetic, but for paramagnetism, it's the spin that matters. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, but m is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum. But in paramagnetism, the magnetic moment comes from the spin, not the orbital. So perhaps the term here is about the spin-orbit coupling, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the paramagnetic coupling is due to the spin magnetic moment interacting with the external field. So the energy would be H = -μ·B. The μ here is the spin magnetic moment, which is μ = g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is the Landé g-factor for spin (which is about 2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term"—so I think that's the Zeeman term due to the spin.

Wait, but the question says that for small m. Wait, m here refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can vary from -l to +l in integer steps. But if m is small, that might affect the value of the energy term. Hmm, but I thought paramagnetism is more about spin, but maybe in this context, it's considering the orbital contribution. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps m here refers to the spin magnetic quantum number m_s, but that's either ±1/2. Wait, but the problem says "small values of m", so maybe it's like m=0 or 1? But I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, the question says for small m. Wait, but the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be from -l to +l. For hydrogen, the ground state is l=0, so m=0. For excited states, l can be 1, 2, etc. So if m is small, like m=0 or m=1, perhaps. But how does that tie into the paramagnetic term?

Wait, maybe I'm getting off track. Let's think about the energies involved.

The transition energy ΔE is given based on the wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. Using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. So let's compute that.

h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 486.1 nm, so 486.1 x 10^-9 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-
