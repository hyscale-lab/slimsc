Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations. But I'll give it my best shot. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Oh wait, that looks a bit complicated. I need to figure out the structure of this molecule to understand how many bonds I'm dealing with.

Hmm, maybe I should count the number of each type of bond in the molecule. Because the problem gives me bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. Oh, and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon is also provided. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using bond energies by considering the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation of a molecule is the change in enthalpy when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think the formula is something like: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed). Or is it the other way around? Oh right, it's the sum of energies of bonds broken minus the sum of energies of bonds formed. Because when you form bonds, that releases energy, so you subtract that.

But wait, wait. No, I think I got that wrong. The formula
