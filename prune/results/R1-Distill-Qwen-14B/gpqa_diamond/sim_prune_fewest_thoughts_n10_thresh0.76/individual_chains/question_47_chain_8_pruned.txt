Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let's see... The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, that's 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. I remember that molecular formulas can help in identifying functional groups. Let's think about the possible structures that fit this.

The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because those regions typically correspond to amine or amide groups. The presence of two bands might suggest two different types of N-H, like maybe an amide (with two N-H) or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine with some hydrogen bonding or different environments.

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So we're probably looking for a carbonyl group, which could be an ester, amide, ketone, or maybe an acid. But since the formula has two oxygen atoms and an amide or ester is likely, I think it's either an amide or an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. Let's list out the peaks:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so maybe adjacent to a CH2.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests a lot of splitting, maybe from exchange or adjacent to an electronegative group. 2H could be an OCH2 group, or maybe a CH2 adjacent to an amide or amine.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring groups. For example, a CH2 next to another CH2 that's next to another CH2. Wait, but 4.5 ppm is a bit upfield. Maybe it's an OCH2CO structure, like an ester. For example, in an ethyl ester, the CH2 next to the oxygen would be around 4.1-4.3, but this is a bit higher. Alternatively, a CH2 adjacent to an amide group? Or maybe a methylene next to an electronegative atom.

- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, 2H. Aromatic protons. Two protons as a doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring where each pair is equivalent. Like in a para-substituted benzene, you have two doublets each integrating to 2H.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. Higher chemical shift implies more deshielding, which often happens when attached to electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyl or nitro groups.

So putting this together. Let's think about the possible structures.

The options are:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Let's analyze each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide is an amide, so the IR should show a strong amide I band (about 1650 cm-1) but wait, the given IR has a strong band at 1720. Hmm, amide carbonyls are usually around 1650-1680, but esters and ketones are higher. Wait, maybe it's a different type
