Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator of a muon. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay. The setup says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = a(φ). So, we're looking for eigenvalues 'a' and eigenvectors φ of this operator.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are often involved in angular momentum operators. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Wait, let me write that out:

S = 
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, Ay = c * S. Substituting c as h/(4π), Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].

So, the matrix Ay is:

[ 0     (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    0 ]

Now, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let me recall how to find eigenvalues. The eigenvalues 'a' satisfy the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me construct (Ay - a I):

[ -a      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h)/(4π) * (i h)/(4π) ) ].

Calculating that:

determinant = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) h² ) / (4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So,

determinant = a² - ( (1) * h² ) / (16 π² )

Set determinant to zero:

a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = (h²)/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π), right? Because
