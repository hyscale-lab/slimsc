Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? And it's used when we consider physics beyond the Standard Model at higher energy scales.

The question gives four options, and I need to pick the correct combination. The choices are about Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Hmm, I think I should go through each symmetry one by one to see which ones are necessary.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I remember that in the Standard Model, all the interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. So in SMEFT, which is an effective theory, the operators must transform correctly under the Lorentz group. If an operator doesn't respect Lorentz symmetry, the theory would have issues with causality and other fundamental aspects. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SMEFT is a field theory, which means it incorporates Poincare symmetry. All the terms in the Lagrangian should be Poincare invariant. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So option 2 is also correct.

Wait, but wait. I think Poincare includes not just Lorentz but also rotations and translations. Since the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must also be Poincare-invariant. So both 1 and 2 are required. But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4 and option A is 1,2. Hmm, but I'm not sure if all operators must respect Poincare. Wait, no, because the SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but maybe Poincare is implied because the operators are part of a theory that includes translations. Or maybe not? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps Poincare is automatically included because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant field theory. So operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. Wait, but I think the question is whether each operator individually must respect these symmetries. Because the Lagrangian must be invariant, each term must transform appropriately. So yes, all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, no, because the Poincare symmetry includes the momentum operator and translation, so each term (operator) in the Lagrangian must be Poincare-invariant. But Lorentz is a subset of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So perhaps answer options 1 and 2 are both correct, but wait the options don't have any that include only 1 and 2 beyond option A. Wait, the options given are A) 1,2; C) 1,2,4.

But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So I think operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare. So in the options, only option C includes 1,2 plus 4. Wait, but the correct answer is probably all the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, and perhaps others.
