Okay, let me try to figure this out. I've got an unknown compound and I need to identify it using the FTIR and 1H NMR data. So, let's break down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the peak is very broad, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because the -OH in those tends to have broader absorption due to hydrogen bonding. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a strong C=O peak around there too. So the compound is probably a carboxylic acid because both O-H and C=O are present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: several peaks, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. Since there are no such signals, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds. So the structure must be fully saturated, no double bonds.

Now, looking at the splitting patterns in the NMR. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, these are complex splitting patterns, which suggests that the protons are coupled to multiple neighboring sets of protons.

Let me think about the possible structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, all these options have the structure where the carboxylic acid is attached to a carbon chain. The main difference is the substituents on the central carbons.

Let's consider the structure. Each compound has a central part where the carbons are substituted with different groups. For example, in options A and C, the central carbons have (CH3) and (CH2CH3) groups. Let me maybe draw their structures.

Wait, maybe I should look for the substitution pattern. The NMR signals with complex splitting suggest that each proton is next to multiple different sets of protons. So perhaps each of these central CH groups is connected to different groups, causing their protons to split into multiple peaks.

Let's see. Each CH group in the molecule would be attached to different substituents. So if a proton is on a carbon that's connected to two different substituents (like a CH2 group or another CH group), it might have complex splitting.

Wait, the structure in each option is something like CH2-C-(something). Let me think about the structure of each option.

Option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So that's CH2CH3 attached to C, which is connected to another C that has CH3 groups. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

So the central part is two CH groups attached to CH3 and each other. So each of these central CH protons would have neighboring groups. Let me think about the coupling.

Each CH in the middle would be adjacent to two different environments. For example, the first CH is connected to a CH2CH3 group and a CH(CH3) group. The neighboring CH would have protons that are equivalent? Or not.

Wait, in the structure, each of those CH groups is attached to two different substituents: one is the CH2CH3 group, the other is a CH3 group. So the central part is like this:

-CH2CH3
   |
CH - C - CH3
   |
   CH3

Wait, no, maybe more accurately, it's a geminal di-substituted carbon. So each of the central CH groups has two CH3 groups attached. Wait, no, let me look at option D again.

Option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is: CH2CH3 connected to a CH, which is connected to another CH, which is connected to COOH. Each of those CH groups has a CH3 group attached. So the two central carbons each have CH3 and CH2CH3 substituents?

Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to a CH2CH3 (from the first substituent) and a CH3 (from the second substit
