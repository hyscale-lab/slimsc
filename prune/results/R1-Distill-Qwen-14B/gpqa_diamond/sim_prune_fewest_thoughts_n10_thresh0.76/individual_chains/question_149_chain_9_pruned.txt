Okay, so I've got this question about a peptidic compound's NMR and LC-MS analysis. Hmm, trying to figure out what's going on. Let me read through the problem again.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks consistent except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. They say it's not spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern rules that out. Then the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass, matching the expected molecule.

So what's happening here? Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If there was a precursor, the mass spec would show different masses. But LC-MS shows same mass for both peaks, so maybe the same compound. So A might not be right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same physical properties except for optical activity. So in NMR, you might not see splitting because the environments are mirror images, but wait, enantiomers would have identical NMR spectra. So wouldn't the NMR show only one peak? But here we have two peaks. Or maybe when the sample isn't pure, but wait, the integrals add up to 1H. Enantiomers are not the same as diastereomers. Also, if the sample were a racemic mixture, you'd see a single peak in the NMR because each H environment is same for both enantiomers. So NMR doesn't distinguish between enantiomers. So maybe B isn't the answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling... like maybe an amide proton is involved in coupling with two different protons. But wait, the question says the peaks are from the same alpha-proton. The two peaks have similar shifts, so perhaps they are coupling with two different environments. Or maybe it's something else. Wait, double coupling would usually cause splitting into multiple peaks, but if it's a triplet or something, but the problem says they appear as two peaks, same shift, equal integrals. Not sure about this option yet.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. If there are two diastereomers, each with the same alpha-proton environment, that might cause splitting. Wait, but why would the same alpha-proton split into two? Let me think. Suppose the two diastereomers have the same chemical environment for that particular proton. Then in each diastereomer, that proton would resonate at the same shift. But if the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, the NMR would show two peaks (each from the same proton in each isomer) but same shift. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the environments are the same, the shift would be same. So why two peaks? Hmm, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, wait. Another possibility is that the two diastereomers have different coupling constants for neighboring protons. But the question says that the coupling
