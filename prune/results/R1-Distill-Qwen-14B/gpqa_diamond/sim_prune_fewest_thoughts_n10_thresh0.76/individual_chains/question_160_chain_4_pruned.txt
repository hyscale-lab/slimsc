Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light with wavelength λ falls vertically on this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and they mention that the angles are small, so we can approximate tan(theta) as theta.

Hmm, I think this is related to diffraction patterns. Since the aperture is a polygon, but when N approaches infinity, it becomes a circle? Because a polygon with infinitely many sides would approximate a circle. Wait, but the apothems are all the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides.

Wait, but if N is approaching infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a', because each side's midpoint is at a distance 'a' from the center. So the aperture would effectively be a circular aperture when N is very large. That makes sense. So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot called the Airy disk. The first dark rings (minima) occur at certain angles. The formula for the angular position of the minima is given by θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the minima in the circular aperture diffraction is when the argument of the Bessel function J1 reaches its first zero. The first minimum occurs where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the zeros of J_m are at specific points. For the first minimum in the far field, it's the first zero of J1, which is at x ≈ 3.8317. But wait, the formula I've heard before is that the first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/(D), where D is the diameter. Because D is 2r
