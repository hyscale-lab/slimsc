Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. Hmm, the question is about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which I think means they aren't accelerating. 

Wait, so the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Oh right, because if the ejecta is moving towards the center, in the ejecta's frame, the center would appear to move towards the ejecta. So the speed is 60,000 km/s in that frame.

But the question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so time is different in each frame. Because of time dilation, I suppose? Oh right, because they're moving relative to each other, so their time measurements will differ.

Wait, but how do I calculate the distance in the Galaxy's frame? So the time given is in the ejecta's frame, and I need to find the distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no, the question says, the ejecta is moving towards the center. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. But in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving at v. So what's the speed between the two frames? Right, these are two
