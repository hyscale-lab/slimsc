Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = ½ m ω² r². I remember that in quantum mechanics, the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is a standard problem, so I should recall some of its properties.

First, the potential is spherically symmetric, which means the system is invariant under rotations. So, the solutions should have certain symmetries, and the energy levels should depend on the quantum numbers in a specific way.

I think the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, I recall that in spherical coordinates, the energy can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number n, where n = 2l + (n_r + l), but wait, that's for hydrogen-like atoms. Oh wait, no, for the isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers plus something.

Wait, perhaps another approach. In 3D, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the three quantum numbers. Let me think. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, each degree of freedom (x, y, z) contributes a (½ ħω)(2n + 1), where n is the quantum number for each direction. So the total energy is the sum of these. Alternatively, each direction contributes (n_i + ½) ħω, so when you sum x, y, z, you get (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Yes, that's right.

So the energy levels are E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers: n = n_x + n_y + n_z. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because each n_i (n_x, n_y, n_z) starts at 0. So n can be 0, 1, 2, etc., but the way the energy is calculated,
