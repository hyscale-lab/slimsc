Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a charge is moving, it not only produces electric fields but also magnetic fields. And these are related to the potentials, right?

So the question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain time t. The setup is that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at point r. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. Oh, right, tr is the time when the field was generated, and t is the current time, with t > tr. So the fields are retarded, meaning they travel at the speed of light.

Wait, I think I remember something about retarded potentials. The scalar potential V for a charge moving with velocity v would depend on the charge and the distance. But since the charge is moving, maybe there's a relativistic effect here. Oh right, the potentials have to account for the motion of the charge when the field was generated.

The scalar potential V is usually given by something like q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, there's a correction term involving the velocity. Or wait, maybe the formula for V is the same as for a static charge because V is like the electrostatic potential, but when considering motion, it's the vector potential A that gets contributions from the velocity.

Wait, no, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) would be q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance at the retarded time. But in the options, the options have terms like 'd c - d ⋅ v' in the denominator. Oh, right, because d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, d would be r - s(tr), right? Because at time tr, the charge is at s(tr), and the vector from there to r is d = r - s(tr). But in terms of the denominator, perhaps it's the dot product of d with the velocity v, adjusted for the fact that the charge's position changes with time.

So the general expressions for the potentials when charges are moving are:

V(r
