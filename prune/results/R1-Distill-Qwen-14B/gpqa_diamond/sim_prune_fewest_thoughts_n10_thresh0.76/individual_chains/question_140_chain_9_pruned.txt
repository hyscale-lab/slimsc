Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow since I'm still learning. 

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Additionally, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. 

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, I think about what Substance X could be. Since it reacts with a liquid (Y) and releases a gas, maybe it's a metal reacting with an acid. For example, metals like sodium or potassium reacting with water or an acid to produce hydrogen gas. Wait, but W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think about possible gases. Hydrogen gas is H2, which has 1 proton each, so 2 in total. Neutrons would be zero each, since hydrogen has no neutrons. Wait, that doesn't fit. Unless it's a different isotope? No, because the molecule's protons and neutrons count. Let me think: another gas possibility could be O2, but O has 8 protons. Neutrons in O-16 would be 8, same as protons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons? No, wait, each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16), so O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total. Oh wait, no: each molecule has 2 atoms, so 2x8 protons and 2x8 neutrons. So total protons and neutrons would be 16 each, so same number. That fits.

Wait, but is O2 a likely gas in such a reaction? Maybe, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is CO2, but that's a molecule with different counts. Wait, CO2 has C (6 protons) and O (8 each). So each CO2 molecule would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons,
