Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P, which is for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I'm given the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The question asks for the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states with definite values. The eigenvectors are found by solving (P - λI)|ψ> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue.

Wait, but the operator here is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Wait, the problem says the muon is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator in question is probably the spin component in that direction. Because usually, when you have a spin-½ particle, the spin operator S (or P here) in a direction n is given by S·n, which is a combination of Sx, Sy, Sz.

So maybe the operator P here is the spin operator in the direction of n, which is in the x-z plane. That would make sense because any direction in the x-z plane can be parameterized by an angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0 (since it's in the x-z plane, so no y-component of direction). Wait, but the arbitrary direction in x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π, but perhaps the direction is (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in x-z, φ is 0 or π, so the direction vector is (x, 0, z) or something like that. But I'm not sure if that matters right now.

Wait, the problem provides the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P. So, the operator P is presumably proportional to the spin operator along some direction, maybe the z-direction, or perhaps it's
