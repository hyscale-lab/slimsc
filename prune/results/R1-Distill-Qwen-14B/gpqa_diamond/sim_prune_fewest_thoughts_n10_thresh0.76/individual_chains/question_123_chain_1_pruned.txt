Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about figuring out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, frames of reference... Oh right, this is a relativity problem, probably involving time dilation or something like that.

So the setup: the ejecta is moving directly towards the Galaxy's center. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's a speed of 6e4 km/s. Wait, that's 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second because sometimes it's easier, but maybe km is okay for the calculations.

Wait, so in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v = 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at the same speed, right? Because if they're inertial frames moving at velocity v relative to each other, each sees the other moving at v. So the ejecta's speed in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, no, actually, if the ejecta is moving towards the center, then from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v. And vice versa, from the ejecta's frame,
