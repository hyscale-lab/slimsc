Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup: They're looking for genes that contribute to resistance against a fungal disease. They found three genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants (single and double) and tested their resistance.

The control has 100% resistance, which I assume means no signs of infection. The mutants have varying percentages. The key is to figure out how these genes interact.

The data:
- g1: 75% → less resistance than control. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance.
- g2: 0% → no resistance. Knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance.
- g3: 50% → half the resistance. So G3's product is important but not as crucial as others.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → very low. Worse than either single mutant.
  - g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone.
  - g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

The question is about the interactions between these genes. I remember that in genetics, the way mutants combine can tell us about their hierarchy. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. If a double mutant shows the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, the other gene is epistatic.

So, for example, if g2g3 shows 0% resistance, same as g2. That might mean that G2 is epistatic over G3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If knocking out both G2 and G3 results in the same as just knocking out G2, that suggests that the presence or absence of G3 doesn't matter when G2 is already knocked out. So, the effect of G3 is only seen when G2 is functional. That would mean G2 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, but another way: if the double mutant's phenotype is more severe than either single mutant, that's additive or synergistic. Or if it's the same as one of them, perhaps one gene is downstream of the other.

In the question, they mention that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, that gene's product would influence the expression of others.

Looking at the data:

- g2 has 0% resistance. That's the most severe. So G2 seems critical. Since knocking out G2 alone causes complete loss, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then other genes like G1 or G3 might be downstream. Because in the double mutants involving G2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the double mutant g1g2: 0%. Since g2 alone is 0%, the double mutant isn't any worse than g2. So G2 is epistatic to G1. So if G2 is a transcription factor, it's possible that G1 is downstream of G2, or perhaps G1 is part of a parallel pathway that's regulated by G2.

Wait, but in the single mutant g1, resistance is 75%. So without G1, the plant is 25% less resistant. So G1 contributes but isn't as crucial as G2.

Let's look at the other double mutants. g1g3: 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So the combined effect is more severe. That suggests that G1 and G3 function in a pathway where their effects are additive. Or perhaps they're in parallel
