Okay, so I have this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Alright, let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about the potentials, V and A. Right, potentials are sort of the sources from which the electric and magnetic fields arise.

So, the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and the field is observed at point r. The vector d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh wait, so the field at r is due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, since it takes time for the fields to propagate.

The question asks for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr. So, the charge has been moving, and we're looking at the fields (or potentials) at a later time.

I remember that the scalar potential for a static charge is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, especially at relativistic speeds, things get more complicated. Oh wait, but maybe this is a non-relativistic case. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume non-relativistic speeds, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the potentials come from the retarded time. The retarded time is when you consider that the influence of the charge's motion takes time to reach the observation point. So the potentials at time t are calculated based on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, specifically tr = t - (r - d)/c, or something along those lines. Or wait, maybe it's d = r - s(tr), so d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r.

In the context of potentials, the scalar potential V is given by the usual Coulomb potential but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) would be q/(4πε₀) times 1 over the distance at the retarded time. But wait, the distance isn't just r, because the charge has moved. Hmm, but the given options have V as q/(4πε₀ r) for option A and B, which suggests maybe that's not considering the motion. But wait, other options have more complicated expressions.

Wait, the vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀ q/(4π)) times v/(c²) times something. Because the vector potential is related to the velocity of the charge. But I'm getting a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, the standard expression for the vector potential due to a moving charge is A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) * v, evaluated at the retarded time. So perhaps the vector potential is proportional to the velocity of the charge.

Looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (dc - d·v)), and the vector potential as (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (dc - d·v)). Hmm, let's parse that.

Wait, the denominator in option C is (dc - d·v). But d is a vector, so dc is d multiplied by c, a scalar. Then subtracting the dot product of d and v. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's think about units for a moment. The denominator should have units of length because it's in the denominator of a potential which has units of volts or something.

Wait, V has units of volts. Let's check each option.

Option A: V is q/(4πε₀ r). So that's correct for static case. But the denominator for V in other options includes terms with c and v. Let's look at the vector potential in A: (v²)/(c²) * V. Hmm, v squared over c squared times V. So the units would be (m²/s²) * (V). Wait, but vector potential A has units of Tesla·m² or something else? Wait, no. Wait, the vector potential A has units of Weber per
