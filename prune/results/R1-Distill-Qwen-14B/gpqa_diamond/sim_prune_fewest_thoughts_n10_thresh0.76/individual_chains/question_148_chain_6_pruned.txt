Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds. Let's go through each part one by one.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state?) of A2 is 31.96%. Wait, wait, maybe oF is the atomic percentage of fluorine? Or perhaps it's the oxidation state. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%", so maybe that's the percentage of fluorine by mass. So A2 has fluorine making up about 31.96% of its mass.

When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and fluorine gas. So maybe the decomposition reaction is something like A1 → A2 + F2. But wait, the stoichiometry isn't given. Alternatively, perhaps it's A1 → A2 + some F2. Let me think: if A1 is a compound of Y and F, and upon decomposition releases F2, then perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, and A2 is a lower one? So, for example, maybe YF3 → YF2 + F2? But that might not make sense for certain elements.

Wait, but A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, maybe it's a high oxidation state fluoride. Common oxidizing agents in fluorine compounds could be like F2 itself, but F2 is a diatomic molecule. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a peroxide or something else, but I'm not sure.

Let me think about the fluorine compounds. Fluorine usually has oxidation states of -1, but in compounds, sometimes it can be in higher states, like in certain oxyfluorides or when combined with other elements. Wait, but in binary compounds, F is usually -1. So maybe Y is in a higher oxidation state.

Wait, but the decomposition of A1 gives A2 and F2. Let's think of an example where a fluoride decomposes into another fluoride and F2. For instance, perhaps YF4 decomposes into YF3 and F2? Let me check the math. Suppose YF4 → YF3 + F2. Let's balance it: YF4 → YF3 + F2. On the left, we have 4 F atoms; on the right, 3 + 2*2 =7 F atoms. That doesn't balance. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe Y is in a higher oxidation state, and upon decomposition, it releases F2. Another possibility: perhaps YF2 is decomposing, but that seems unlikely because YF2 being a binary compound. Wait, maybe Y is oxygen? No, because we're dealing with fluorine compounds. Wait, perhaps Y is something like chlorine? No, because chlorine's compounds with fluorine would
