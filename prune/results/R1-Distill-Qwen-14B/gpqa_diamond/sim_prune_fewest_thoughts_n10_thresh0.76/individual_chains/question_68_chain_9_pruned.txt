Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles and magnetic moments. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field because the field is along Z. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, so initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz. So the energy of the particle in a magnetic field is given by the Zeeman term, which is -mu·B. So when B is along Z, the energy is -gamma Sz B.

But then the field is turned off and a new B is applied along Y. So the magnetic field direction changes from Z to Y. I'm trying to remember how the spin state evolves when the magnetic field changes direction.

Oh right, when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The Hamiltonian before was proportional to Sz, and after, it's proportional to Sy. So the system goes from having a Hamiltonian H1 = gamma B Sz to H2 = gamma B Sy (since the magnetic field is now in Y direction).

Wait, but when the field is suddenly switched, the state of the particle doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state of the system is an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue ħ/2 (since spin-1/2, so sz = ħ/2 when spin is up). So when the field is along Z, the particle is in an eigenstate of H1, so it's stationary.

But when the field is suddenly turned off and turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian H2 is proportional to Sy. So the state |+z> is no longer an eigenstate of H2. Therefore, the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we need to find the expectation value <
