Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the question again.

An intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud has a spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for them to reach Earth from their perspective. The options are A to D, with A suggesting they die before getting there.

Hmm, wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is huge.

But the spacecraft is moving at nearly the speed of light. So from an Earth perspective, it would take about 200,000 years to reach us. But the astronaut's own experienced time is different because of time dilation in special relativity.

Oh right, time dilation is when time moves slower for the traveler from the perspective of the Earth. So the astronaut would age less than the time it takes from Earth's frame.

Wait, but the question is from the astronaut's point of view. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the shortest time between two events in the frame where those events happen at the same place. Here, the spaceship's journey starts and ends at the same place for the astronaut—wait, no, the astronaut is moving from their home to Earth, so maybe not. Or perhaps the proper time is the time measured by the astronaut's own clock.

So, the formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and t' is the astronaut's time.

Wait, no, wait. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is greater than 1 when v is a significant fraction of c. The time experienced by the astronaut (t') is t / gamma, where t is the time in Earth's frame.

But wait, how do I find t, the Earth frame time? Because the distance is D = 200,000 light-years approximately, and the speed is 0.9999998
