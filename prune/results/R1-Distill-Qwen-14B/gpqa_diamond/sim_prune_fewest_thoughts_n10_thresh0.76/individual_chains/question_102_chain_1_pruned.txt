Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science question. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, it's about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. So the question is about why there's no green signal in the mice after certain crosses.

The setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Let me recall what bicistronic means. Oh right, it's a vector that allows two genes (ligand and receptor here) to be expressed from a single transcript, each under their own promoters or regulatory elements.

The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the vector has the ligand and receptor in the same reading frame but different fusions.

I remember that in bicistronic vectors, the two ORFs are arranged in a way that allows their expression. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's the chicken beta actin promoter with a regulatory element. Then upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the second ORF can be translated after the first one. So the transcript is for both ligand and receptor, but the ribosome translates the first, then moves to the second via IRES.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed first. The receptor is after IRES, so it would be expressed as well. But the vectors have stop cassettes. Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

So the stop cassettes are under the control of loxP sites. Lox sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. When Cre is present, it recombines and excises the stop cassette, allowing the downstream tags (mCherry and eGFP) to be expressed.

In the question, antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, and testing was done on Western blot. After that, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is under SOX10 regulation, meaning it's expressed in neural crest cells.

After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal. The problem is that no green signal is observed. Green would be from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So the eGFP is not being expressed.

Possible reasons for this:

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression? The expression is about whether the eGFP is made, not whether the ligand-receptor interaction is autocrine or paracrine. So I don't think this is the reason.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If it's stuck, it wouldn't be expressed on the cell surface, so no fluorescence. But the question is about the construct not being expressed at all. Because the Western blot would have shown the presence of the protein. Wait, but the question says that after plasmid transfection, they tested expression on Western blot. So if the construct was properly processed, the Western would show the proteins. If not, maybe no expression. But the question says that they did raise antibodies and tested expression—I'm not sure, but maybe in the Western, they didn't see the eGFP? Or maybe they saw the ligand but not the receptor. Let me think.

Wait, the stop cassettes are under loxP and lox2272. SOX10-Cre is used, which is a Cre that's active in the neural crest. So when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassettes. So the ligand would have mCherry, and the receptor would have eGFP.

But if the construct is in a mouse that's homozygous for the construct, and they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous, the Cre would be active in the same cells where SOX10 is expressed—neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes perhaps.

But why would they not see eGFP? Let's consider the vector: the ligand is first, with stop cassette, then mCherry. Receptor is second, with stop, then eGFP. So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, so both mCherry and eGFP would be expressed. So the proteins would be present.

But if the eGFP is not in frame, then the fusion wouldn't work. Let's look at option D: receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So the stop cassette is with lox2272. The lox2272 is a variant of loxP that requires Cre for recombination but is directional. Wait, but in the vector, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, so if the vector is designed such that the stop is in frame, and the lox2272 is used, then Cre would remove the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be in frame.

Wait,
