Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us about the stability of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The complexes here are probably Co(SCN)_n^2+ ions, with n ranging from 0 to 4, maybe? Wait, but the β values go from β1 to β4, so maybe each β represents the formation of a specific complex.

Wait, wait. I think β for a complex is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the metal ion and the ligands. So for Co(SCN)_n^2+, the stability constant βn would be the product of adding each SCN^- step by step.

So β1 is the constant for Co(SCN)_1^+, right? Wait, Co(II) starts as Co²+; adding SCN^- would form complexes like Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2^0, etc. So each βn corresponds to the nth complex.

So for n=1, β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)^+ → Co²+ + SCN^-
So the reaction would be: Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)²+ (Wait, but charge-wise, Co²+ plus SCN^- (charge -1) would give Co(SCN)^+ (charge +1). Hmm, maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2+ - n), so for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; etc. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check that detail, but maybe it's not critical for this problem.

Anyway, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue complex is the one with two SCN ligands, so Co(SCN)_2^0. But wait, the β given for β2 is 40. So β2 is the stability constant for the second complex? Or is βn the cumulative constant?

Ah, right, βn is the cumulative stability constant. So β1 is for the first complex, β2 is for the second (so includes the first and second ligands), and so on. So βn = [Co(SCN)_n²−n+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n).

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the stability constant for the nth complex is the product of the stepwise constants. For example, β1 is the first step, β2 is the second step, but when considering β2 as the cumulative constant for two
