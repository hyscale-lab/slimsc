Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ (which is 0.1 liters) of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, which means it's a base. When you add an acid to a base, they should neutralize each other. So the reaction is probably Fe(OH)3 reacting with a strong acid to produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and maybe some salt.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. I should calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. To do that, I need its molar mass. Let's see: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 has Fe (55.85) + 3*(O + H) = 3*(16 + 1) = 3*17=51. So 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles, or 9.36e-4 moles.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a base. When it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl or HNO3, which are monobasic, the reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Since the acid is monobasic, each molecule provides one H+ ion.

So the stoichiometry is 3 moles of H+ reacting per mole of Fe(OH)3. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+.

The moles of H+ needed would be 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. So 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles of H+.

Now, the acid solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. We have a 0.1 M solution. So volume (in liters) = moles / concentration. Moles needed is 0.002808, concentration is 0.1 M. So volume = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but wait. The total solution volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³, right? Because the problem says 100 cm³ total volume. So the volume of the acid added is 28.08 cm³, but wait, when you add 28.08 cm³ of acid to 100 cm³ total? Wait, no. Because 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding. Or is it the initial volume? Hmm, the question says, "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So I think the 100 cm³ is the final volume. So the initial volume is perhaps less, but when you add the acid to the Fe(OH)3, the total becomes 100 cm³. So perhaps, the 100 cm
