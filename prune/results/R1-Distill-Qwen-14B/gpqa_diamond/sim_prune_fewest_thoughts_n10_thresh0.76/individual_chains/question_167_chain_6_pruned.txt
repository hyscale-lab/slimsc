Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh right, and N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity, nG, using the relative entropy measure del_b.

Wait, what's relative entropy? Oh right, it's like the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions. In this case, it's the relative entropy between the state rho (the non-Gaussian state) and tau, which is the Gaussian reference state.

The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. But wait, I remember that for relative entropy, it's usually S(rho||tau) = trace(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). So maybe that's the same as what's given here: trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) would be equal to S(rho||tau) + S(tau||rho) or something? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, actually, no—the relative entropy is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). So the formula given here is different. Oh, the problem states that del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which would be S(rho||tau) - S(tau)? No, because S(rho) is trace(rho ln rho), and S(tau) is trace(tau ln tau). So del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), right?

Wait, but the problem says that tau is the reference Gaussian state. So if rho is non-Gaussian, the relative entropy would measure how different rho is from the Gaussian state tau. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure.
