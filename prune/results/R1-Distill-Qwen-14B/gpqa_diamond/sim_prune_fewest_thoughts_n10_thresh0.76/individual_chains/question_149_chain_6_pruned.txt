Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question about a peptidic compound. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly right except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So they're splitting into two, but it's not because of coupling. Hmm. Wait, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then looking at the LC-MS results: two peaks of equal intensity. Same mass, so same m/z. But the same mass implies same molecular weight. Oh, but wait, the question says each peak has the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected. So it's not a different molecule. So the mass is the same, but why two peaks in LC-MS?

So options are A to D. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The precursor would have a different mass, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction, maybe. So in LC-MS, the precursor would have a higher m/z. But both peaks here have same mass as expected, so this might not fit. Unless the question says the same mass as expected, which it does. So maybe the alternative is, perhaps, a byproduct or some other isomer.

Option B: Enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so same mass. In LC-MS, if the column is chiral, it would separate enantiomers, giving two peaks. But if the LC column is achiral, it might not separate them, so you get one peak. Unless the question says the LC-MS was run at elevated temperature. Wait, but enantiomers are usually separated by chiral chromatography. If the column isn't chiral, they would come out together. So if there are two peaks, maybe the column is chiral, meaning the sample is a racemic mixture. But then, in the NMR, if you have two enantiomers, would that cause two peaks for the same proton? Wait, no, because in racemic mixtures, the NMR would average out. Unless the sample isn't pure and has some other isomer, but I'm not sure.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, not sure what that means. Maybe during the formation of the amide, some kind of coupling leads to two different products? I'm not familiar with that term. Maybe it's about some sort of reaction where the same proton is coupling with two different groups, but the question says it's not spin-spin coupling. So probably not this.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in NMR, their peaks would not average. So in the NMR, you'd see splitting based on different environments. But wait, the two peaks in NMR are for the same alpha-proton, but in diastereomers, the environment changes so they would split into separate peaks. Also, in LC-MS, they would have
