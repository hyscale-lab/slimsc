Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my binary star dynamics, but let me try to think it through.

So the question is about two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses, I think. Then, the spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations with certain amplitudes.

Wait, what do I remember about radial velocities in binary systems? Oh right, each star orbits the common center of mass. The RV variations are due to the Doppler effect as the stars move towards or away from us. The amplitude of these variations depends on the mass of the companion star. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship.

So for each system, I have the RV amplitudes for both stars. System_1: 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2: 15 and 10. And the periods are 2 years and 1 year.

I think the key here is to find the mass function or something related to the masses of the stars. Because the problem is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh wait, the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses. So I need to find the total mass for each system and then compare them.

Wait, but how do I get the masses from the RV data? Let me recall. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion. The formula I remember is K = (v * sin i) for each star, where i is the inclination angle. But wait, since both stars orbit the same center of mass, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because the center of mass requires m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, so m1/m2 = a2/a1. And since velocity is proportional to a (for the same orbital period), v1/v2 = m2/m1.

So in system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5. Let me denote them as K1a and K1b. Similarly for system_2, K2a=15 and K2b=10.

Since the ratio of the velocities is K1a/K1b = 10/5 = 2. But from the mass ratio, that would be (m2/m1) = 2. So m2 = 2 m1. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = m1 + 2m1 = 3 m1. So m1 = (m_total_1)/3, m2 = (2 m_total_1)/3.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of the mass function or Kepler's third law. Oh, right, Kepler's third law for binary systems. The period is related to the total mass. But the exact formula I need might involve the RV amplitudes.

Wait, the formula for the mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P) / (2 π G) ), but I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Alternatively, the mass ratio can be determined from the velocity ratio. Since m1/m2 = v2/v1.

So for system_1, K1a = 10 km/s and K1b =5.

So the velocity ratio is 10:5 = 2:1. So m1/m2 = v2/v1 = (5)/(10) = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 m2. So m_total_1 = m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Wait, that gives m_total_1 = 1.5 m2? Wait, but system_1's period is 2 years, system_2's period is 1 year. Hmm, how does the period relate to the masses?

Ah, Kepler's third law for binary systems. The formula is (P^2 G )/(4 π²) ) = a³ (m1 + m2)^(-1), but I might have that wrong. Alternatively, the formula is (m1 + m2) = (4 π² a³)/(G P²). But without knowing a, maybe I can relate the two systems.

Wait, but the period is also connected with the velocities. Because the orbital velocity is v = 2 π a / P. So a = v P / (2 π).

Wait, maybe I can combine this with the mass ratio.

Let me think about each system.

For system_1:

Total period P1 = 2 years.

Star 1 has velocity K1a = 10 km/s.

Star 2 has velocity K1b =5 km/s.

Their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses: m1/m2 = K1b/K1a =5/10= 0.5. So m1 =0.5 m2.

So the total mass is m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly, for system_2:

P2 = 1 year.

K2a =15, K2b=10.

Velocity ratio is 15:10 =3:2. So m2a / m2b = 2/3. So m2a = (2/3) m2b.

Wait, wait. Let me get the notation right. For system_2, the two stars have masses m2a and m2b.

The mass ratio (m2a/m2b) = (v2b / v2a) = (10/15) = 2/3. So m2a = (2/3) m2b.

So total mass for system_2 is m2a + m2b = (2/3) m2b + m2b = (5/3) m2b.

Now, I need to relate the masses to the periods. Using Kepler's third law for the binary system, which states that (m1 + m2) * P² = (4 π² a³) / G. But since I don't know a, maybe I should find the ratio of the masses of the two systems.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to consider the mass function in terms of the observed radial velocities.

Alternatively, let's think about the masses in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period.

The formula I might be missing is that the mass ratio q = (m1)/(m2) = (v2)/(v1). So in system_1, q1 = m1/m2 = 0.5, as earlier. For system_2, q2 = m2a/m2b = (10/15) = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

Wait, but how do I get the total mass of each system?

Alternatively, the mass function for each star is f(m) = (K^3 P)/(2 π G), but without knowing the inclination angle, I can't get the actual mass. Wait, but since both systems are being compared, perhaps the inclination angles are similar (like edge-on, so sin i ≈1), so maybe the ratio of the mass functions would give the ratio of the masses.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me consider the center of mass. In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit (since m1 a1 = m2 a2). So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So v1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * v_total, and v2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) * v_total. Wait, or perhaps I should think in terms of the velocity amplitudes.

So for each system, the mass ratio is (m1/m2) = (v2/v1).

In system_1, m1/m2 =5/10=0.5. So m1=0.5 m2.

In system_2, m2a/m2b=10/15=2/3=0.6667. So m2a=0.6667 m2b.

Now, the mass of each system is sum of the two masses.

So for system_1: M1 = m1 + m2 = 0.5 m2 + m2 =1.5 m2.

For system_2: M2 = m2a + m2b = (2/3 m2b) + m2b = (5/3) m2b.

Now, how does the period relate to the mass and the velocities?

The orbital period P is related to the velocity and the size of the orbit. Since each star's orbit is a circle, their velocity is v = 2π a / P. So a = v P/(2π).

But the two stars' semi-major axes are a1 and a2, and a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the stars). And from the center of mass condition, m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So, a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) a and a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) a.

But perhaps a better approach is to use Kepler's law in terms of velocity.

The orbital velocity v is given by v = sqrt( G (m1 + m2) / a ). Hmm, wait. No, actually, the formula I remember is v = (2 π G (m1 + m2) )^(1/3) / (P) )^(1/1) }, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the total velocity of the two stars is v1 + v2 = v_total.

But from the center of mass, m1 v1 = m2 v2. So v2 = (m1/m2) v1.

So v_total = v1 + (m1/m2)v1 = v1 (1 + m1/m2) = v1 ( (m2 + m1)/m2 ) ) = v1 (M/m2 ), where M is the total mass.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is helping. Maybe I should think in terms of the period and the velocities.

The period P is the time it takes for each star to complete an orbit. So the circumference is 2 π a. So v = 2 π a / P. So a = v P/(2 π).

But the velocity is also related to the gravitational force. The gravitational force provides the centripetal acceleration for each star.

So for star 1: G (m1 m2) / a² = m1 v1² / a1.

Similarly for star 2: G (m1 m2) / a² = m2 v2² / a2.

But since a1 + a2 = a, and from the center of mass, a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) a, a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) a.

Let me substitute a1 into the first equation.

G m2 / a = v1² a1 / a.

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Maybe I can find a relation between the velocities and the period.

Alternatively, the total mass M = m1 + m2 can be expressed in terms of the period and the velocities.

Because from the center of mass condition, m1 a1 = m2 a2.

And the velocities are v1 = 2 π a1 / P, v2 = 2 π a2 / P.

So v1 / v2 = a1/a2 = m2/m1.

Which matches what I said earlier about the mass ratio being inverse of velocity ratio.

But I'm not getting closer to the total mass yet.

Wait, perhaps I can express the total mass in terms of the observed velocity amplitudes and the period.

I came across a formula before: M = ( (v1 + v2)^3 P ) / (2 π G) ), but I might have misremembered it.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is that the mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P) / (2 π G), where K is the RV semi-amplitude of one star, and assuming edge-on orbit (sin i =1). But since we don't know the inclination, perhaps we can't get the absolute mass, but we can compare the two systems.

Wait, but if both systems have the same inclination (which is a big if, but the problem doesn't specify otherwise), then the ratio of their mass functions would give the ratio of their actual masses.

Wait, but the mass function is f(m) = (m2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (m1 + m2)^2 (1 + q)^2 ) ), where q is the mass ratio. I'm getting a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period.

For each system, the sum of the two velocities is v1 + v2 = (m2 + m1)/ (m1 m2) ) * v1, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the total velocity is v1 + v2, and since the stars are orbiting each other, the product of velocity and period is related to the circumference of their orbits.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the mass of a binary system in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period.

I think the formula is M = (4 π² / G) * (a1 a2 ) sin^3 i / (P² (1 + q)² ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I can find a way to compute the mass ratio between the two systems.

Let's think about the mass of each system.

For system_1:

M1 = m1 + m2. From the velocity ratio, m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5, so m1 = 0.5 m2. So M1 = 0.5 m2 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

For system_2:

m2a/m2b = 10/15 = 2/3. So m2a = (2/3) m2b. So M2 = (2/3) m2b + m2b = (5/3) m2b.

Now, according to Kepler's third law for binary systems, (M1 + M2) * P² = (4 π² a^3)/( G ), but that's not directly helpful since I don't know a.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the masses to the periods using the velocities.

The velocity of each star is v = 2 π a_i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit.

But from the center of mass condition, a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) a and a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) a. So a = a1 + a2.

So for system_1:

v1 = 2 π a1 / P1 = 2 π ( (m2/(M1)) a ) / P1.

Similarly, v2 = 2 π ( (m1/(M1)) a ) / P1.

But M1 = m1 + m2. Hmm, but without knowing a, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps the product of the velocities and the period can give me something.

Alternatively, let's think about the velocity and period relation for each system.

For each star in each system, the velocity is v = (2 π a_i ) / P.

But a_i = (m2/M) a for star 1, and a_i = (m1/M) a for star 2.

So v1 = (2 π (m2/(M)) a ) / P.

Similarly, v2 = (2 π (m1/(M)) a ) / P.

And since a = a1 + a2 = (m2/(M) + m1/(M)) a = a, which checks out.

But I'm stuck again. Maybe I should consider the total velocity of the system.

Wait, the sum of the two velocities is v1 + v2 = 2 π (a1 + a2) / P = 2 π a / P.

But a is the separation between the stars. Hmm.

But from Kepler's third law, (M1) (P1)^2 = (4 π² a^3)/( G ), so a^3 = (G M1 P1²)/(4 π²).

So a = [ (G M1 P1²)/(4 π²) ]^(1/3).

Substituting this into the sum of velocities:

v1 + v2 = 2 π a / P1 = 2 π [ (G M1 P1^2 /4 π² ) ]^(1/3) / P1.

Let me compute that.

Let me write:

a = [ ( G M1 P1^2 ) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So 2 π a / P1 = 2 π [ ( G M1 P1^2 )/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 ) / P1.

Let me simplify the expression inside the cube root:

(G M1 P1^2 )/(4 π²) ) = ( G M1 )/(4 π²) ) * P1^2.

So, [ ( G M1 )/(4 π²) ) * P1^2 ]^(1/3) = [ G M1 / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * P1^(2/3).

So 2 π a / P1 = 2 π * [ G M1/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * P1^(2/3) / P1.

Which simplifies to 2 π * [ G M1/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) * P1^( -1/3 ).

Hmm, that's still a bit complex, but perhaps we can relate the velocities to the mass and period.

Wait, but the sum of the two velocities (v1 + v2) is equal to 2 π a / P, which is the same for both stars as they orbit in the same period. But that's just the orbital velocity around the center of mass.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each system, the sum of the velocities is v1 + v2 = (2 π G M1 )^(1/3) / (P1 ) )^(1/1) ) * some factor.

Alternatively, I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should try to find the ratio of the masses of the two systems.

We have:

System_1:

M1 = 1.5 m2.

System_2:

M2 = (5/3) m2b.

But I need to relate m2 and m2b to the periods.

Wait, according to Kepler's third law, (M) P² = (4 π² a^3)/( G ). But without knowing a, perhaps I can take the ratio of the masses.

Wait, but perhaps the velocity amplitudes and the period can be combined to find the mass.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the mass function is useful here. The mass function for a binary system is given by:

f(m) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G )

Where K is the RV semi-amplitude, P is the orbital period, and G is the gravitational constant.

But since I don't know the inclination angle i, I can't get the actual mass, but since both systems are observed, perhaps I can compare their mass functions.

Wait, but the mass function for each star would be f(m) = (K^3 P )/(2 π G ), and the actual mass depends on the inclination. But if we assume that both systems have the same inclination (which is a big assumption, but perhaps valid here), then the mass function would be proportional to the actual mass.

Wait, no, the mass function is f(m) = (m2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (m1 + m2)^2 (1 + q)^2 ), where q = m1/m2.

But without knowing sin i, perhaps I can't get the actual masses. So maybe this approach won't work.

Hmm. Maybe I should instead think about the velocities and the period to find the mass.

Wait, for each star, the velocity K is related to the mass of the companion and the period.

I think the formula is K = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (m2 sin i) / ( (m1 + m2)^(2/3) (1 + q) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But again, without knowing i, this is tricky.

Wait, but perhaps I can write the mass ratio in terms of the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, for system_1:

m1/m2 = 0.5.

So M1 = m1 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Similarly, for system_2:

m2a/m2b = 2/3.

So M2 = m2a + m2b = (5/3) m2b.

Wait, but how to relate M1 and M2?

Wait, according to Kepler's third law, the period is related to the mass and the separation. But without knowing the separation, perhaps I can relate the periods and the mass functions.

Alternatively, considering that the period is the same for both stars in a system, but different between the two systems.

Wait, system_1 has period 2 years, system_2 has period 1 year.

Let me think about the mass function for each system.

For system_1, the mass function for star 1 is f1 = (K1a^3 P1 )/(2 π G )

Similarly, for system_2, f2 = (K2a^3 P2 )/(2 π G )

Assuming sin i is the same for both (which I'm not sure is a valid assumption, but perhaps the question expects it), then the mass functions would be proportional to the actual masses.

Wait, but the mass function isn't the total mass. It depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination. So maybe this approach isn't the right one.

Alternatively, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the ratio of the masses can be determined by the product of the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Wait, let me think again. For each system, the product of the velocity amplitudes and the period might be related to the mass.

Wait, for system_1:

v1 = 10 km/s, v2=5 km/s, P=2 years.

v1 * v2 = 50 (km/s)^2.

P=2 years.

For system_2:

v1=15, v2=10. P=1.

v1*v2=150.

P=1.

But I'm not sure how this relates to mass. Maybe I can find a relation between the product of velocities, the period, and the mass.

Wait, perhaps the product of the velocities is proportional to (m1 m2) / (M^2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, combining the velocity ratio and the period, perhaps I can find M1/M2.

Wait, let me try using the mass function approach.

The mass function is f(m) = (K^3 P)/(2 π G ), but it depends on the inclination. However, if I take the ratio of the mass functions for the two systems, perhaps the dependence on inclination cancels out.

Wait, for system_1, f1 = (10^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = (2000) / (2 π G )

For system_2, f2 = (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G ) = (3375) / (2 π G )

So f2 / f1 = 3375 / 2000 = 1.6875.

But the mass function is f(m) = (m^3 sin^3 i )/( (M + m)^2 (1 + m/M)^2 ), where m is the mass of the companion.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's consider the velocity and the period.

In the binary system, the velocity amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion and the period.

The formula I found is:

K = (v) = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but I'm not confident in this formula. Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula:

K = ( (G (M_p + M_s) )/(4 π²) )^(1/3) * ( (2 π)/P )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(1/3) (1 + q)^(2/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be.

Another approach: the mass function is given by:

f(m) = ( (K^3 P) ) / (2 π G ) )

But for each star in the binary system, the mass function depends on the mass of the companion. So for system_1, star 1 has f1a = (10^3 * 2)/(2 π G ), and star 2 has f1b = (5^3 * 2)/(2 π G ). Similarly for system_2, f2a = (15^3 *1)/(2 π G ), f2b=(10^3 *1)/(2 π G ).

But I'm not sure how this helps me compare the masses of the entire systems.

Wait, perhaps the mass function for each star is a fraction of the total mass. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the mass ratio between the two systems using the velocity and period data.

Wait, let's think about the total system mass for each system in terms of the velocity and period.

For system_1:

The two velocity amplitudes are 10 and 5. The period is 2 years.

The mass ratio is m1/m2 =5/10=0.5.

So the total mass M1= m1 + m2= 1.5 m2.

For system_2:

v1=15, v2=10. period=1.

mass ratio m2a/m2b=10/15=2/3.

Total mass M2= m2a + m2b= (2/3 m2b) + m2b= (5/3) m2b.

Now, I need to find the ratio M1/M2.

Wait, but how?

Perhaps using Kepler's third law: for each system, (M) P² = (4 π² a^3 )/ G.

But since the period is different, I can't directly compare a.

Alternatively, if I can relate a to the velocities.

The velocity of each star is v = 2 π a_i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit.

But a_i = (m_companion/(M)) a.

So for system_1, star 1 has a1 = (m2/(M1)) a.

Similarly, star 2 has a2 = (m1/(M1)) a.

So, v1 = 2 π a1 / P1 = 2 π (m2 a)/(M1 P1 )

Similarly, v2 = 2 π a2 / P1 = 2 π (m1 a)/(M1 P1 )

But from the center of mass, m1 a1 = m2 a2.

Which gives (m1 * (m2 a)/(M1)) ) = (m2 * (m1 a)/(M1) ), which is correct.

But I'm not getting closer to the mass ratio.

Wait, perhaps I can express a in terms of M1 and P1 using Kepler's law.

From Kepler's third law:

a^3 = ( G M1 P1² )/(4 π² )

So, a = [ ( G M1 P1² )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting this into the velocity expression for star 1:

v1 = 2 π a1 / P1 = 2 π (m2 a)/(M1 P1 )

= 2 π m2 [ ( G M1 P1² )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 ) / (M1 P1 )

Simplify:

= 2 π m2 [ ( G M1 P1² )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ] / ( M1 P1 )

= 2 π m2 [ (G M1 P1² )^(1/3) ) ] / [ (4 π² )^(1/3) M1 P1 ) ]

Let me cube both sides to eliminate the cube roots:

v1^3 = [ (2 π m2 )^3 (G M1 P1^2 ) ) ] / [ (4 π² )^(1) M1^3 P1^3 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (8 π^3 m2^3 G M1 P1^2 ) ) / (4 π² M1^3 P1^3 )

= (8 π^3 m2^3 G M1 P1^2 ) ) / (4 π^2 M1^3 P1^3 )

Simplify:

= (8/4) * (π^3 / π^2 ) * ( m2^3 G ) / ( M1^2 P1 )

= 2 π m2^3 G / ( M1^2 P1 )

So,

v1^3 = (2 π G m2^3 )/( M1² P1 )

But M1 = m1 + m2 = 1.5 m2.

So,

v1^3 = (2 π G m2^3 )/( (1.5 m2 )² * P1 )

= (2 π G m2^3 ) / ( 2.25 m2^2 * P1 )

= (2 π G m2 ) / ( 2.25 P1 )

Hmm, interesting. So,

v1^3 = (2 π G m2 ) / ( 2.25 P1 )

Similarly, for system_2, for star 2a:

v2a^3 = (2 π G m2b ) / ( ( (M2)^2 P2 ) * (something?) )

Wait, perhaps I can write a similar expression for system_2.

In system_2, M2 = (5/3) m2b.

So for star 2a, which has velocity 15:

v2a^3 = (2 π G m2b )/( ( (5/3 m2b )² * P2 ) )

= (2 π G m2b )/( (25/9 m2b² ) * P2 )

= (2 π G )/( (25/9 m2b P2 ) )

= (18 π G )/(25 m2b P2 )

So now, let's take the ratio of v1^3 from system_1 to v2a^3 from system_2.

v1^3 / v2a^3 = [ (2 π G m2 )/( 2.25 P1 ) ) ] / [ (18 π G )/(25 m2b P2 ) ) ]

= [ (2 π G m2 ) / (2.25 P1 ) ] * [ 25 m2b P2 ) / (18 π G ) ) ]

Simplify:

The π and G terms cancel.

= (2 m2 )/(2.25 P1 ) * (25 m2b P2 )/(18 )

= (2 *25 )/(2.25 * 18 ) * (m2 m2b ) * ( P2 / P1 )

= (50 )/(40.5 ) * (m2 m2b ) * ( P2 / P1 )

But I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere.

Wait, but perhaps I can express m2 in terms of m2b.

Wait, I don't have any relation between m2 (from system_1) and m2b (from system_2). So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the mass function for each star is proportional to (K^3 P ), and then compare the two systems.

For system_1, star 1: f1a = (10^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = (2000 )/(2 π G )

Star 2: f1b = (5^3 * 2 )/(2 π G ) = (250 )/(2 π G )

For system_2:

f2a = (15^3 *1 )/(2 π G ) = 3375/(2 π G )

f2b = (10^3 *1 )/(2 π G ) = 1000/(2 π G )

But without knowing the inclination, I can't get the actual mass. However, perhaps the ratio of the mass functions will give the ratio of the masses, assuming the same inclination.

Wait, for system_1, the mass function for star 1 is f1a and for star 2 is f1b.

The mass function for each star is f(m) = (m2^3 sin^3 i )/( (m1 + m2)^2 (1 + q)^2 ), where q = m1/m2.

So for system_1, f1a is for star 1: m1, so f1a = (m2^3 sin^3 i )/( (m1 + m2)^2 (1 + m1/m2 )^2 )

Similarly, f1b is for star 2: m2, so f1b = (m1^3 sin^3 i )/( (m1 + m2)^2 (1 + m2/m1 )^2 )

Hmm, but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each mass function (f1a and f1b) relates to the same (m1 + m2)^2 term. Perhaps the sum of the mass functions equals the total mass? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps since system_1's mass function for star 1 is higher than for star 2, I can find a relation.

But I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I should try considering the mass ratio based on the velocity amplitudes and the periods.

Let me think: The product of velocity and period for each star.

For system_1:

v1 * P1 = 10 km/s * 2 years =20 (km/s * years )

v2 * P1 =5 *2=10.

For system_2:

v2a * P2=15 *1=15.

v2b * P2=10 *1=10.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this relates to mass.

Wait, perhaps velocity times period relates to the size of the orbit.

v * P = (distance traveled in one orbit) = circumference = 2 π a.

So for system_1, star 1: v1 * P1 = 10 *2=20.

So 2 π a1 =20 → a1=20/(2 π )=10/π.

Similarly, star 2: v2 * P1=5 *2=10 → a2=10/(2 π )=5/( π )

So a1 =2 a2, which makes sense because m1/m2=0.5 → a1=2 a2.

Similarly, for system_2, star 2a: v2a * P2=15*1=15 → a2a=15/(2 π )

Star 2b: v2b * P2=10 → a2b=10/(2 π )=5/π.

So a2a= 15/(2 π )= 7.5/π, a2b=5/π. So a2a=1.5 a2b, which matches the mass ratio m2a/m2b=2/3 → a2a /a2b = 3/2 → opposite? Wait, no. Because m2a/m2b=2/3, so a2b = (m2a/(m2a + m2b)) a, and a2a = (m2b/(m2a + m2b)) a. So a2a/a2b = m2b/m2a= (3/2), which is 1.5. Which matches a2a=15/(2pi)=7.5/pi, a2b=5/pi → 7.5/pi / 5/pi = 1.5, which is 3/2.

So that seems correct.

Now, using Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to (a)^3/(M), where M is the total mass.

So for each system:

P1^2 = (4 π^2 a^3 )/( G M1 )

Similarly, P2^2 = (4 π^2 a'^3 )/( G M2 )

But a in system_1 is a1 + a2= (10/pi +5/pi )=15/(pi )

Similarly, a' in system_2 is a2a + a2b = (15/(2pi)+5/pi )= (15 +10 )/(2pi )=25/(2pi )

So,

For system_1: (2)^2 = (4 pi^2 (15/pi )^3 )/( G M1 )

→4 = [4 pi^2 * (3375 )/( pi^3 ) ) ]/( G M1 )

= [4 pi^2 * 3375 ]/( pi^3 G M1 )

= [4 * 3375 ] / ( pi G M1 )

→4 = (13500)/( pi G M1 )

→ M1 = 13500/(4 pi G ) = 3375/( pi G )

Similarly, for system_2:

(1)^2 = (4 pi^2 (25/(2 pi ))^3 )/( G M2 )

→1 = [4 pi^2 * (15625 )/( 8 pi^3 ) ) ]/( G M2 )

= [4 pi^2 * 15625 ]/(8 pi^3 G M2 )

= [ (4 * 15625 ) ]/( 8 pi G M2 )

= (62500 )/(8 pi G M2 )

= (7812.5 )/( pi G M2 )

→ M2 =7812.5/( pi G )

Now, compute M1 and M2.

M1 =3375/( pi G )

M2=7812.5/( pi G )

So, the ratio M1/M2= (3375)/(7812.5 )= 3375/7812.5.

Calculating that: 

3375 ÷ 7812.5.

Let me compute:

7812.5 × 0.432 = ?

Wait, 7812.5 × 0.4 = 3125.

7812.5 ×0.432 = 3125 + 0.032 *7812.5.

0.032 *7812.5= 250.

So 3125 +250=3375.

So 0.432 ×7812.5 =3375.

So 3375/7812.5=0.432.

Which is approximately 0.432, which is ~0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option D is ~0.7. So the closest would be option A (~0.4). But 0.432 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.5.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 3375 ÷ 7812.5.

Compute 7812.5 * 0.432.

Wait:

0.4 ×7812.5= 3125.

0.03 ×7812.5=234.375.

0.002 ×7812.5=15.625.

Add: 3125 +234.375=3359.375 +15.625=3375.

Yes, so 0.432 gives exactly 3375.

So M1 is 0.432 times M2.

Wait, but wait, M1 is the mass of system_1, M2 is the mass of system_2.

So system_1 is 0.432 times more massive than system_2? No, wait, no. Because M1=0.432 * M2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

Wait, but the question is: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?".

So if M1 =0.432 M2, then M1 is 0.432 times M2, meaning system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2, so system_1 is less massive by a factor of ~0.43.

But the options are looking for system_1 being more massive than system_2, so the factor would be less than 1. But the options given are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So 0.432 is closest to option A (0.4) or D (0.7). Wait, 0.432 is approximately 0.43, which is closer to 0.4 (0.4 difference is 0.03) than to 0.5 (which is option B at 0.6). Wait, no, option B is ~0.6, which is 0.168 away. So 0.43 is closer to 0.4 (0.43-0.4=0.03) than to 0.7 (0.7-0.43=0.27).

So the answer would be ~0.43, which isn't an option, but the closest is option A (0.4) or perhaps the answer is ~0.43, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the M1 and M2 values.

Wait, for system_1:

a = a1 + a2 = (10/pi +5/pi )=15/pi.

P1=2 years.

Using Kepler's third law:

M1 = (4 pi² a^3 )/( G P1^2 )

So,

M1 = (4 pi² (15/pi )^3 )/( G (2)^2 )

= (4 pi² * 3375 / pi^3 )/(4 G )

= (4 *3375 )/( pi G *4 )

= 3375/( pi G )

Similarly, for system_2:

a' =25/(2 pi )

P2=1 year.

M2= (4 pi² (25/(2 pi ))^3 )/( G (1)^2 )

= (4 pi² * 15625/(8 pi^3 ) ) / G 

= (4 pi² * 15625 )/(8 pi^3 G )

= (4 *15625 )/(8 pi G )

= (62500 )/(8 pi G )

=7812.5/( pi G )

So M1=3375/( pi G )

M2=7812.5/( pi G )

So M1/M2=3375/7812.5 =0.432.

Which is approximately 0.43, which is closer to option A (0.4) than any other. But the options don't have 0.43. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the ratio as M2/M1, not M1/M2.

Wait, if M1=0.432 M2 → M1 is 43% of M2, so system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.43.

But the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if system_1 is less massive, it's 0.43 times as massive. So the factor is ~0.43.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (~0.4) or option D (~0.7). Since 0.43 is closer to 0.4 (difference 0.03) than to 0.7 (difference 0.27), option A would be the correct choice.

But option A is ~0.4, which is about 0.4, but the actual value is 0.432, which is approximately 0.43. Hmm, perhaps I should look for the option that best fits. The options are A: ~0.4, D: ~0.7.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.43, but perhaps a calculation mistake occurred earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that I inverted M1 and M2.

Wait, the problem says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2". So, factor = M1 / M2.

If M1 =0.432 M2, the factor is 0.432. So system_1 is 0.432 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. So the factor is ~0.43.

The options don't have 0.43. Wait, looking back, the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So 0.43 is closer to 0.4 (A) than 0.7 (D). So the answer would be A.

Wait, but perhaps my approach is incorrect. Maybe I should have considered the ratio of the velocities and the periods differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the mass ratio using the velocity amplitudes and the periods.

Wait, another approach: the mass ratio (q) is (v1/v2). So for system_1, q1=5/10=0.5.

Mass of system_1: M1= m1 + m2=1.5 m2.

For system_2, q2=10/15=2/3. So M2= m2a + m2b= (5/3) m2b.

Now, using Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 pi² a^3)/( G M )

But a = a1 + a2.

In system_1:

a = a1 + a2 = (v1 P / (2 pi )) + (v2 P/(2 pi )) ) = (10*2 +5*2 )/(2 pi ) )= (20 +10)/2pi= 30/(2 pi )=15/pi.

Similarly, in system_2:

a' = (15*1 +10*1 )/(2 pi )=25/(2 pi )

So for system_1:

M1 = (4 pi² a^3 )/( G P^2 ) = (4 pi² (15/pi )^3 )/( G (2)^2 )

= (4 pi² * 3375 / pi^3 )/(4 G )

= (13500 pi² )/(4 pi^3 G )

= (13500 )/(4 pi G )

=3375/( pi G )

Similarly, system_2:

M2= (4 pi² a'^3 )/( G P^2 )= (4 pi² (25/(2 pi ))^3 )/( G (1)^2 )

=4 pi² * (15625)/(8 pi^3 ) ) / G

= (4 * 15625 * pi² )/(8 pi^3 G )

= (62500 pi² )/(8 pi^3 G )

= (62500 )/(8 pi G )

=7812.5/( pi G )

So, M1=3375/( pi G ), M2=7812.5/( pi G )

M1/M2= 3375/7812.5 =0.432.

So the factor is approximately 0.43, which isn't an option, but the closest is option A (~0.4) or option D (~0.7).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of M1 and M2.

Let me re-calculate M1 and M2.

For system_1:

a = (v1 +v2) * P/(2 pi )= (10+5)*2/(2 pi )=30/(2 pi )=15/pi.

P=2 years.

So,

M1= (4 pi² a^3 )/( G P^2 )

= (4 pi² (15/pi )^3 )/( G (2)^2 )

= (4 pi² * (3375)/(pi^3 ) )/(4 G )

= (4 pi² * 3375 )/(4 G pi^3 )

= (3375 pi² )/( G pi^3 )

=3375/( G pi )

Similarly, for system_2:

a' = (15+10)*1/(2 pi )=25/(2 pi )

M2= (4 pi² a'^3 )/( G (1)^2 )

= (4 pi² (25/(2 pi ))^3 )/ G 

=4 pi² (15625)/(8 pi^3 ) ) / G 

= (4 *15625 pi² )/(8 pi^3 G )

= (62500 pi² )/(8 pi^3 G )

=62500/(8 pi G )

=7812.5/( pi G )

So M1=3375/( pi G ), M2=7812.5/( pi G )

So M1/M2=3375/7812.5=0.432.

So, system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So it's less massive by a factor of ~0.43.

The options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

0.43 is closer to 0.4 (A) than to 0.7 (D), but it's also not one of the options exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the mass ratio is (v1 * v2 ) / (v1' * v2' ) * (P2 / P1 )

Wait, that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass ratio is ( (v1 * v2 ) / (v1' * v2' ) ) * ( P1 / P2 )

Hmm, but without a clear formula, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the mass ratio using the fact that the product of the velocity amplitudes is inversely proportional to the sum of the masses.

Wait, I'm really not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is that system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2, so the factor is ~0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4) or perhaps D (0.7). But since 0.43 is closer to 0.4, I'll go with option A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data about the binary star systems. The key parameters provided are the orbital periods and the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes of the two stars in each system. The total mass of a binary system is the sum of the masses of its two stars, and the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars. Using this relationship, we calculate the mass ratios and total masses of the two systems.

### System_1:
- Orbital period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
- RV amplitudes: \( K_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_{1b} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
- Mass ratio: \( \frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{K_{1b}}{K_{1a}} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \)
- Total mass: \( M_1 = m_1 + m_2 = 0.5m_2 + m_2 = 1.5m_2 \)

### System_2:
- Orbital period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \)
- RV amplitudes: \( K_{2a} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2b} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
- Mass ratio: \( \frac{m_{2a}}{m_{2b}} = \frac{K_{2b}}{K_{2a}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \)
- Total mass: \( M_2 = m_{2a} + m_{2b} = \frac{2}{3}m_{2b} + m_{2b} = \frac{5}{3}m_{2b} \)

### Mass Ratio:
To compare the total masses of the two systems, we use Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period, separation, and total mass. The separation \( a \) can be expressed in terms of the RV amplitudes and period:
\[
a = \frac{K P}{2\pi}
\]
For system_1:
\[
a_1 = \frac{(10 + 5) \cdot 2}{2\pi} = \frac{30}{2\pi} = \frac{15}{\pi}
\]
For system_2:
\[
a_2 = \frac{(15 + 10) \cdot 1}{2\pi} = \frac{25}{2\pi}
\]
Using Kepler's third law:
\[
M \propto \frac{a^3}{P^2}
\]
For system_1:
\[
M_1 \propto \frac{\left(\frac{15}{\pi}\right)^3}{2^2} = \frac{3375}{\pi^3 \cdot 4}
\]
For system_2:
\[
M_2 \propto \frac{\left(\frac{25}{2\pi}\right)^3}{1^2} = \frac{15625}{8\pi^3}
\]
The ratio of the total masses is:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{\frac{3375}{\pi^3 \cdot 4}}{\frac{15625}{8\pi^3}} = \frac{3375 \cdot 8}{4 \cdot 15625} = \frac{27000}{62500} = 0.432
\]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately 0.432 times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.4**.
