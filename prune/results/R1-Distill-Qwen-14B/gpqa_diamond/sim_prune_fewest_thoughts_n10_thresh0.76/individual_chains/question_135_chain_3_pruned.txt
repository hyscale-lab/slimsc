Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decays, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, wait, that notation is a bit confusing. I think it's saying that the boson X couples to a fermion ψ_f and the Yukawa coupling term is something like λ times the product of the fermion field and X.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing possible decay channels.

So, I remember that for a boson like this to decay into fermions, the mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because in particle decays, conservation of energy requires the available energy (the mass of the boson) to be enough to create the rest mass of the resulting particles.

First, I should list all the possible fermion pairs that X could decay into. The fermions would be quarks (like up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (like electrons, muons, taus, and their antiparticles).

Wait, but the mass of X is 6 GeV. Let me think about the masses of these particles.

Electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, which is negligible compared to 6 GeV. Same for muon (around 105.7 MeV), and tau is about 1.78 GeV. So tau is the heaviest lepton, but 1.78 GeV each. So for a pair of taus, the total mass would be about 3.56 GeV. That's under 6 GeV, so that's allowed.

For quarks, the masses are a bit trickier because they're not truly free particles but confined. So for decay purposes, we look at the mass of the constituent quarks. Let me recall the approximate masses:

Up and down quarks are about 2-5 MeV each
