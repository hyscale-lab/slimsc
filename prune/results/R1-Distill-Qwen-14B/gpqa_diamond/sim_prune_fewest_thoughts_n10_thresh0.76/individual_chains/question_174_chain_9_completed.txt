Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

Wait, so M is the initial mass. The two fragments' combined rest mass is 0.99M. That means some mass has been converted into energy, right? But that's probably taken care of when they split, and we're focusing on their kinetic energies here.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. They want the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Right, so first, I should figure out the rest masses of the two fragments. Let me call the mass of the lighter fragment m. Then the more massive one is 2m. So their sum is m + 2m = 3m. And according to the problem, this sum is 0.99M. Wait, so 3m = 0.99M → m = 0.99M /3 ≈ 0.33M. So the two masses are about 0.33M and 0.66M.

Wait, but wait, M is the initial mass. Before fission, the nucleus is at rest, so the total energy is its rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the two fragments have rest mass energies of m*c² and 2m*c². But since their combined rest mass is 0.99M, that's 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the rest masses add up to 297 GeV, which means the energy released (Q value) is 3 GeV. But I'm not sure if that's directly needed yet.

Since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for the two fragments. Using momentum conservation: (mass1)*v1 = -(mass2)*v2. So (m)(v1) = -(2m)(v2) → v1 = -2v2. Wait, but velocity signs don't matter here since we're dealing with magnitudes for kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Let's think in terms of actual vectors. The initial momentum is zero, so the sum of the fragments' momenta must be zero. So (m) * v1 = (2m) * v2, but in opposite directions. So m*v1 = 2m*v2 → v1 = 2*v2. Wait, no, wait: the momentum vectors are opposite. So m*v1 = -2m*v2. So v1 = -2 v2. Hmm, but I'm more interested in their speeds than directions.

Wait, but maybe using energy conservation would help. The initial energy is all rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the energy is the sum of their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies. So:

300 GeV = (m*c² + 2m*c²) + (K1 + K2).

But wait, m is the rest mass of the lighter fragment, 2m is the rest mass of the heavier. The sum m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M, so m = 0.33 M as I said before.

Wait, but M is the initial rest mass. So m = 0.33 M, 2m = 0.66 M. So their rest mass energies are:

m c² = 0.33 M c²,

2m c² = 0.66 M c².

Combined, that's 0.99 M c², which matches the given.

So the initial energy is M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is (0.33 M c² + 0.66 M c²) + (K1 + K2) = 0.99 M c² + K1 + K2.

So 300 GeV = 297 GeV + K1 + K2 → K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Hmm, that's a small amount of kinetic energy. But wait, that's the total kinetic energy. So each fragment has some kinetic energy, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive one, T1.

In the non-relativistic case, we can use conservation of momentum and kinetic energy. But wait, let me think about the relativistic case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to approach this using the concept of invariant mass or conservation of energy and momentum in a relativistic context.

Let me think about the system after fission. The two fragments are moving with some velocities, and their total momentum is zero (since the initial nucleus was at rest). So p1 = -p2. Wait, but p is relativistic momentum, which is gamma m v.

Wait, but in terms of magnitude, |p1| = |p2|.

So for fragment 1 (mass m) and fragment 2 (mass 2m):

gamma1 * m * v1 = gamma2 * 2m * v2.

But from momentum conservation, p1 = -p2, so the magnitudes are equal: gamma1 m v1 = gamma2 2m v2.

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe using energy and momentum conservation is the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the velocities of the two fragments using the energy and momentum.

Wait, but let's consider the center of momentum frame. Since the nucleus was at rest, the center of momentum is the same as the initial rest frame. So in this frame, the two fragments move in opposite directions with velocities v1 and v2.

Because of momentum conservation, as before, (m gamma1 v1) = (2m gamma2 v2), but in opposite directions. Or perhaps I should write the vector form. Anyway, it's getting a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe I should use the fact that the mass-energy after fission includes the kinetic energies. So in the rest frame, the total energy is 300 GeV, and the rest masses sum to 297 GeV, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, as before.

So K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

But how to split this between the two fragments.

In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is (1/2) m v². So for fragment 1 (mass m) and fragment 2 (mass 2m), their velocities must be such that their momenta are equal and opposite.

So m v1 = 2m v2 → v1 = 2 v2.

The kinetic energies would be (1/2) m (2 v2)^2 = 2 m v2², and (1/2)(2m) v2² = m v2².

So K1 = 2 m v2², K2 = m v2².

Total kinetic energy: 3 m v2² = 3 GeV.

So m v2² = 1 GeV → v2² = (1 GeV)/(m).

But wait, m is in terms of M, which is 300 GeV/c². Because M c² = 300 GeV → M = 300 GeV / c².

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused here. Let's think in terms of units.

Wait, m is 0.33 M. So m = (0.33) * (300 GeV/c²) = 99 GeV/c².

So m = 99 GeV/c².

So substituting, m v2² =1 GeV → 99 GeV/c² * v2² = 1 GeV → v2² = (1 GeV) * c² / 99 GeV → v2² = c² /99 → v2 = c / sqrt(99).

So v2 ≈ c / 9.949 ≈ 0.1 c.

Hmm, that's 0.1c, which is 3e7 m/s. For non-relativistic speeds, this is definitely non-negligible. So maybe the classical approximation isn't that good here. Hence, the relativistic effects may be significant, leading to a difference in T1.

So in the non-relativistic case, K1 = 2 m v2² = 2 * (1 GeV) = 2 GeV.

Wait, because earlier we had m v2² =1 GeV, so K1 = 2 m v2² = 2 GeV, and K2 = m v2² = 1 GeV. So total is 3 GeV.

But wait, in reality, we're dealing with relativistic speeds, so the kinetic energy would be higher than the non-relativistic case because relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c².

So let me try to compute the relativistic speed.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem using relativistic momentum and energy.

The total energy of each fragment is E1 = gamma1 * m c², E2 = gamma2 * 2m c².

The momenta are p1 = gamma1 m v1, p2 = gamma2 (2m) v2.

Since the nucleus was at rest, total momentum is zero, so p1 = -p2.

So gamma1 m v1 = gamma2 (2m) v2.

Divide both sides by m: gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2.

Hmm, and the energies: E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

E1 = gamma1 m c²,

E2 = gamma2 (2 m) c².

So,

gamma1 m c² + gamma2 2 m c² = 300 GeV.

Divide both sides by m c²:

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = 300 GeV / (m c²) → but m c² is 99 GeV, since m = 0.33 M and M c²=300 GeV.

So 300 GeV / (99 GeV) = 3.0303... So,

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = 3.0303.

Hmm, that's one equation. Now, from the momentum equation: gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2.

But in terms of beta, which is v/c, let me write v1 = beta1 c, v2 = beta2 c.

So,

gamma1 beta1 c = 2 gamma2 beta2 c → gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

Another equation. Now, let's think about each gamma in terms of beta.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2).

So, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta1²),

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta2²).

Hmm, this might get complicated, but perhaps we can relate beta1 and beta2.

Let me consider that beta1 and beta2 are related. From the momentum equation,

gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

Let me square both sides:

(gamma1^2) (beta1^2) = 4 (gamma2^2) (beta2^2).

But gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2), so:

(1/(1 - beta1^2)) beta1^2 = 4 (1/(1 - beta2^2)) beta2^2.

Which can be written as:

beta1² / (1 - beta1²) = 4 beta2² / (1 - beta2^2).

Let me denote x = beta1², y = beta2².

Then,

x/(1 -x) = 4 y/(1 - y).

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed further. Maybe I should make an assumption, like beta1 = 2 beta2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation from gamma1 and gamma2.

Wait, let's see. Let's denote gamma1 = a, gamma2 = b.

From the momentum equation:

a beta1 = 2 b beta2 → a beta1 = 2 b beta2.

But I don't know beta1 or beta2.

Wait, but from the energy equation:

a + 2 b = 3.0303.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe an alternative approach: considering that the two particles have equal and opposite momenta, so the magnitude is the same. So p1 = p2 = p.

Each particle's kinetic energy is E = gamma m c² - m c².

So, for fragment 1: K1 = (gamma1 m c² - m c²) = (gamma1 - 1) m c².

Fragment 2: K2 = (gamma2 * 2m c² - 2m c²) = (gamma2 - 1) 2m c².

Total kinetic energy: K1 + K2 = (gamma1 -1) m c² + 2 (gamma2 -1) m c².

Which equals (gamma1 + 2 gamma2 - 3) m c².

But we know that K1 + K2 = 3 GeV, and m c² =99 GeV.

So,

(gamma1 + 2 gamma2 -3) * 99 GeV = 3 GeV.

Divide both sides by 99 GeV:

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 -3 = 3 /99 → 1/33.

So,

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = 3 + 1/33 ≈ 3.0303.

Which matches our earlier equation.

Hmm, but that doesn't help me much yet.

Wait, another equation comes from the momentum. Let me express p in terms of each fragment.

p = gamma1 m v1 = gamma2 * 2m * v2.

Divide both sides by m:

gamma1 v1 = 2 gamma2 v2.

Expressed in terms of beta:

gamma1 beta1 c = 2 gamma2 beta2 c → gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

Let me square both sides:

gamma1² beta1² = 4 gamma2² beta2².

But gamma² = 1/(1 - beta²), so:

(beta1²)/(1 - beta1²) ) = 4 (beta2²)/(1 - beta2²).

Which I can write as beta1² (1 - beta2²) = 4 beta2² (1 - beta1²).

Expanding:

beta1² - beta1² beta2² = 4 beta2² - 4 beta1² beta2².

Bring all terms to one side:

beta1² - beta1² beta2² -4 beta2² +4 beta1^2 beta2^2 = 0.

Simplify:

beta1² + 3 beta1^2 beta2^2 -4 beta2² = 0.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can assume beta1 is much larger than beta2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can make a substitution. Let's let beta1 = 2 beta2. Because from the momentum equation, if beta1 is higher, perhaps it's a factor of 2.

Wait, if beta1 = 2 beta2, then:

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (4 beta2²)).

Then, the momentum equation:

gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2 → (1/sqrt(1-4 beta2²)) * 2 beta2 = 2 * gamma2 beta2.

Divide both sides by 2 beta2:

(1/sqrt(1-4 beta2²)) ) = gamma2.

But gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - beta2²).

So,

1/sqrt(1-4 beta2²) = 1/sqrt(1 - beta2²).

Squaring both sides:

1/(1-4 beta2²) = 1/(1 - beta2^2).

Cross-multiplying:

1 - beta2^2 = 1 -4 beta2^2 → -beta2^2 = -4 beta2^2 → 3 beta2^2 = 0 → beta2 = 0.

But that can't be right, because beta can't be zero when there's kinetic energy. So my assumption that beta1 = 2 beta2 is invalid. Hmm.

Alternative approach: Let me try to find beta1 and beta2 numerically.

We have two equations:

1) gamma1 + 2 gamma2 = 3.0303.

2) gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

And beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

But perhaps I can express everything in terms of beta1 and beta2, and relate to the energy equation.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express gamma1 in terms of gamma2 from equation 2.

From equation 2: gamma1 = (2 gamma2 beta2) / beta1.

Substitute into equation 1:

(2 gamma2 beta2) / beta1 + 2 gamma2 = 3.0303.

Factor out gamma2:

gamma2 [ (2 beta2 / beta1) + 2 ] =3.0303.

Hmm, but I still have two variables, beta1 and beta2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express beta1 in terms of beta2 using equation 2.

Equation 2: gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

But gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta1^2),

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta2^2).

So,

[1/sqrt(1 - beta1^2)] * beta1 = 2 [1/sqrt(1 - beta2^2)] * beta2.

Square both sides:

beta1^2 / (1 - beta1^2) = 4 beta2^2 / (1 - beta2^2).

Which can be rearranged as:

beta1^2 (1 - beta2^2) = 4 beta2^2 (1 - beta1^2).

Expanding:

beta1^2 - beta1^2 beta2^2 = 4 beta2^2 -4 beta2^2 beta1^2.

Bring all terms to left:

beta1^2 - beta1^2 beta2^2 -4 beta2^2 +4 beta2^2 beta1^2 = 0.

Combine like terms:

beta1^2 +3 beta1^2 beta2^2 -4 beta2^2 =0.

Factor out beta1^2:

beta1^2 (1 +3 beta2^2) -4 beta2^2 =0.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe I can let x = beta2^2, then:

beta1^2 (1 +3x) =4 x → beta1^2 = (4x)/(1+3x).

Perhaps substitute this into the energy equation.

From equation 1: gamma1 + 2 gamma2 =3.0303.

Expressed in terms of beta:

gamma1 =1/sqrt(1 -beta1^2),

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 -x).

So,

(1 / sqrt(1 - beta1^2 )) + 2 (1 / sqrt(1 -x)) = 3.0303.

But since beta1^2 = (4x)/(1+3x), we can substitute.

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - (4x)/(1+3x) ) + 2/sqrt(1 -x) = 3.0303.

Simplify the first term:

Denominator inside sqrt: [ (1+3x) -4x ) ] / (1+3x) ) → (1 -x)/(1+3x).

So,

1 / sqrt( (1 -x)/(1+3x) ) ) = sqrt( (1+3x)/(1 -x) ).

So the equation becomes:

sqrt( (1+3x)/(1-x) ) + 2/sqrt(1-x) =3.0303.

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(1-x):

= [ sqrt(1+3x) + 2 ] / sqrt(1-x) ) = 3.0303.

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

Let me denote equation as:

[ sqrt(a) + b ] / c = d → [ sqrt(a) + b ] = d c → then square both sides.

So,

sqrt( (1+3x)/(1-x) ) + 2 = 3.0303 * sqrt(1-x).

Let me call the left side (A + B) where A is the sqrt term and B is 2.

So,

A + B = 3.0303 * sqrt(1-x).

Squaring both sides:

(A + B)^2 = (3.0303)^2 (1 -x).

Expanding left side:

A² + 2 A B + B² = (3.0303)^2 (1 -x).

But A² = (1+3x)/(1 -x),

B=2, so B²=4,

So,

(1+3x)/(1-x) + 4 A +4 = (3.0303)^2 (1 -x).

Hmm, but this seems messy. Maybe I can make an initial approximation. Let's say that x is small. Because the kinetic energy is only 3 GeV, which is much less than the rest mass energy of 99 GeV for the lighter fragment.

Wait, if the kinetic energy is small, perhaps beta is small. Let me test with x being small.

If x is small, then 1 -x ≈1, and 1+3x ≈1. So,

A = sqrt( (1+3x)/(1 -x) ) ≈ sqrt( (1 +3x) ) ≈ 1 + (3x/2).

So,

A ≈1 + (3x/2).

So,

A + B ≈1 + (3x/2) +2 =3 + (3x/2).

Right side: 3.0303 * sqrt(1-x) ≈3.0303 (1 - x/2).

So,

3 + (3x/2) ≈3.0303 (1 - x/2).

Multiply out the right side:

≈3.0303 - (3.0303 x)/2.

Bring all terms to the left:

3 + (3x/2) -3.0303 + (3.0303 x)/2 ≈0.

Simplify:

(3 -3.0303 ) + ( (3/2 +3.0303/2 ) x ) ≈0.

3 -3.0303 is approximately -0.0303.

The coefficient of x is ( (3 +3.0303 ) /2 ) x → (6.0303/2 ) x ≈3.01515 x.

So,

-0.0303 +3.01515 x ≈0 →3.01515 x ≈0.0303 → x≈0.0303/(3.01515)≈0.01005.

So x≈0.01005 → beta2≈sqrt(0.01005)= approximately 0.10025.

So beta2 ≈0.10025 c.

Then beta1^2 =4x/(1+3x) →4*(0.01005)/(1+0.03015) →0.0402 /1.03015≈0.0390 → beta1≈sqrt(0.0390)≈0.1975.

So beta1≈0.1975 c.

Now, let's compute gamma1 and gamma2.

gamma2 =1/sqrt(1 -x) →1/sqrt(1-0.01005)=1/sqrt(0.98995)≈1/0.99497≈1.005.

gamma1 =1/sqrt(1 - beta1^2 )=1/sqrt(1-0.0390)=1/sqrt(0.961)≈1/0.9803≈1.020.

So now, let's compute the kinetic energies.

K1 = (gamma1 -1) * m c².

m c² is 99 GeV.

gamma1 is approximately 1.020, so gamma1-1=0.020.

So K1 ≈ 0.020 *99 ≈1.98 GeV ≈2 GeV.

K2 = (gamma2 -1) * 2 m c².

gamma2 ≈1.005, so gamma2 -1=0.005.

2 m c² is 198 GeV.

So K2 ≈0.005 * 198 ≈0.99 GeV ≈1 GeV.

Which matches the non-relativistic case. So the approximation seems to hold, but wait, that's in the non-relativistic case. But wait, I used the small beta approximation, which may be leading us to similar results.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake here because when beta is around 0.2, the non-relativistic approximation (where KE = ½ mv²) would have a larger error. Wait, but in our case, the non-relativistic approach gave K1 as 2 GeV, which is what the relativistic approach also gives, but maybe that's because the approximation is good enough.

Wait, but the problem states that we need to find the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) T1.

So, in the non-relativistic case, K1 is 2 GeV.

In the relativistic case, according to our approximation, K1 is approximately 2 GeV as well, so the difference would be negligible. But wait, that can't be right, because our calculation for gamma1 was 1.020, leading to K1 ≈2 GeV. But wait, what about a more precise calculation?

Let me do a more precise calculation without the small x assumption.

Let me try to compute more accurately.

We have:

gamma1 + 2 gamma2 =3.0303,

gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

From the first equation, gamma1=3.0303 - 2 gamma2.

Substitute into the second equation:

(3.0303 - 2 gamma2 ) * beta1=2 gamma2 beta2.

But beta1 = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma1² ) → but this might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps using the earlier substitution where beta1²=4x/(1+3x) and x=beta2².

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximate values found earlier.

But perhaps I should compute the exact values using the earlier equations.

Earlier, we found x≈0.01005, which gives K2≈1 GeV.

But perhaps using more precise calculation would yield a more accurate K1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma1 and gamma2 more accurately.

Given that:

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 - beta1^2)=1/sqrt(1-0.039)=1/sqrt(0.961)=1/0.980305≈1.0200.

So, K1= (gamma1-1) *99 GeV = (1.0200-1) *99≈0.02 *99=1.98 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, K1 was 2 GeV. So the relativistic K1 is approximately 1.98 GeV. So the difference is about 0.02 GeV, which is 20 MeV.

Wait, 0.02 GeV is 20 MeV (since 1 GeV=1000 MeV).

So the correct T1 is approximately 1.98 GeV, and the classical approximation is 2 GeV. The difference is 0.02 GeV, which is 20 MeV.

But wait, the question asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So if correct is lower than classical by 20 MeV, the difference is 20 MeV. But wait, no: 2 GeV minus 1.98 GeV is 0.02 GeV, which is 20 MeV. So the correct value is less than the classical by 20 MeV.

So the difference is 20 MeV. But the options are A) 2, B)5, C)10, D)20.

So the answer should be D)20 MeV.

Wait, but wait a minute. In our relativistic calculation, K1 came out to be approximately 1.98 GeV, while the classical was 2 GeV. So the correct value is 1.98 GeV and the classical is 2 GeV, so the difference is 0.02 GeV, which is 20 MeV. So the correct T1 is lower than the classical by 20 MeV.

Thus, the difference is 20 MeV. So the answer is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \), using both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches. The goal is to find the difference between the correct relativistic value of \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation.

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \) and is at rest.
- After fission, it splits into two fragments:
  - Fragment 1 (lighter): mass \( m \),
  - Fragment 2 (more massive): mass \( 2m \).
- The total rest mass of the two fragments is \( 99\% \) of the initial mass, i.e., \( m + 2m = 0.99M \), where \( M \) is the initial mass.
- The rest mass energy of the lighter fragment is \( m c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV} \), and the heavier fragment is \( 2m c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV} \).
- The total rest mass energy after fission is \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \) as the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

### Key Equations
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before and after fission is conserved:  
   \[
   300 \, \text{GeV} = 297 \, \text{GeV} + K_1 + K_2,
   \]
   where \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) are the kinetic energies of the lighter and heavier fragments, respectively. Thus, \( K_1 + K_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero:
   \[
   p_1 = -p_2,
   \]
   where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are the relativistic momenta of the lighter and heavier fragments, respectively.

### Relativistic Kinetic Energy
The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:
\[
K = (\gamma - 1) m c^2,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \beta = \frac{v}{c} \) is the velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.

For Fragment 1 (lighter):
\[
K_1 = (\gamma_1 - 1) m c^2,
\]
For Fragment 2 (heavier):
\[
K_2 = (\gamma_2 - 1) (2m c^2).
\]

### Non-Relativistic Approximation
In the non-relativistic limit, the kinetic energy is:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2.
\]
Using momentum conservation, the velocities of the two fragments are related by:
\[
m v_1 = 2m v_2 \implies v_1 = 2v_2.
\]
The kinetic energies are then:
\[
K_1 = \frac{1}{2} m (2v_2)^2 = 2m v_2^2, \quad K_2 = \frac{1}{2} (2m) v_2^2 = m v_2^2.
\]
From energy conservation:
\[
K_1 + K_2 = 3m v_2^2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \implies m v_2^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Thus:
\[
K_1 = 2 \, \text{GeV}, \quad K_2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Relativistic Correction
To compute the relativistic \( K_1 \), we solve for the velocities and Lorentz factors using the relativistic equations. The lighter fragment has mass \( m = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), and the heavier fragment has mass \( 2m = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using momentum and energy conservation, the relativistic calculations yield:
\[
K_1 \approx 1.98 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)
The non-relativistic \( K_1 \) is \( 2 \, \text{GeV} \), and the relativistic \( K_1 \) is approximately \( 1.98 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
\[
\Delta K_1 = 2 \, \text{GeV} - 1.98 \, \text{GeV} = 0.02 \, \text{GeV} = 20 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic value of \( T_1 \) and the classical approximation is **20 MeV**.
