Okay, so I need to figure out how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Both planets are around stars with the same mass as the Sun, and the planets themselves have masses similar to Neptune. The method used is the radial velocity (RV) method, which detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. 

From what I remember, the RV method measures the velocity of the star as it moves towards and away from us because of the planet's orbit. The shift in the spectral lines (wavelength) depends on that velocity. The formula I think is related to the Doppler effect.

The Doppler shift formula is delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, but wait, actually, the shift is often expressed as the velocity. So the measured velocity is the star's velocity due to the planet. I think the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (sin i) ) / ( (P)^(1/3) * (2π)^(1/3) * (c) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version, since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than their stars (which are solar mass). So M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the equation simplifies because M_p is negligible.

I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) ]^(1/3) ) * (sin i) / (P^(1/3) * c )

Wait, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is also given by:

K = ( (v) ) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p / M_*) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate (1 + M_p/M_*) as ≈1. So K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / M_*^(2/3)

But wait, given that, the question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_* is the same for both. Also, the planets have similar masses (Neptune), so M_p is the same for both. The only differences are the Doppler shifts, and hence the velocities (K) of the stars, and the orbital periods.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelength shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2 it's 7 milliangstroms. But how does the wavelength shift relate to velocity?

The Doppler shift formula is: (Δλ / λ) = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star. So the shift is proportional to the velocity. So for planet #1,
