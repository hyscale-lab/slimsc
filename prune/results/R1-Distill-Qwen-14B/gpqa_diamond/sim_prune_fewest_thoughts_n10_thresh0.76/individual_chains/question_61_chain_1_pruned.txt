Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene, and each step forms a new product. Finally, we're supposed to determine the structure of product 5 and choose the correct option from A to D.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction step by step.

First step: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene usually uses a mixture of nitrating acid, which is typically a combination of HNO3 and H2SO4. So the product here would be nitrobenzene. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Oh no, wait. Wait, when benzene is nitrated, it adds a nitro group. But where? Nitration is an electrophilic substitution reaction, and the nitro group is a meta-directing group. So the product, product 1, should have a nitro group attached to the benzene ring. But wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4â€”so that's nitration. The product is nitrobenzene, which is a benzene ring with a nitro group attached. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Second step: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and Fe. Oh, so that's probably a bromination reaction. So FeBr3 is a catalyst for electrophilic substitution. Wait, but in this case, it's Br2 and Fe. Oh, wait, I think when you have Br2 and Fe, it's for adding bromine via electrophilic substitution. So nitrobenzene has a nitro group which is meta-directing. So the next substituent will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. But wait, wait. Wait, the nitro group is a strong meta-directing group. So the bromine will add at the meta position. So the structure now is bromine in the meta position relative to nitro. So the benzene ring has nitro and bromo groups in the 1 and 3 positions, but wait, benzene is symmetric, so it's actually the same as 3-bromo-nit
