Alright, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the basics. Both observatories have spectrographs with different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitude up to 17, while HIRES can go up to 16. So, a star that's brighter than 16 mag in V can be seen by both? Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, which is fainter, but HIRES can't go that faint. So for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16, because HIRES can't go beyond that. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. That means it can see stars up to 17 mag and brighter (which are lower numbers). HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so up to 16 mag. So, which stars are brighter than 17 mag (wait, no, wait: brighter than 17 mag in V means magnitude less than 17. Because lower magnitude is brighter. So stars with V < 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, V <16 mag can be seen.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16. Because if it's 16.5, then it's only detectable by ESPRESSO (since 16.5 < 17?), but not by HIRES. Wait, no: the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V brighter than 17 mag. So, if a star is brighter than (has V mag less than) 17, it can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag brighter than 16, so less than 16.

So, the star must have an apparent V mag less than 16 to be detected by both. Because if it's, say, 16.5, then for HIRES it's beyond their limit (16.5 >16), so they can't observe it. But ESP
