Okay, so I've come across this problem where I need to figure out what the algorithm does to a DNA sequence to produce a specific number. The given examples are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. My task is to find out what value the sequence ACAGTGACC gives. The options are A) 315, B)185, C)333, D)351.

Hmm, let me start by looking at the examples. I'll write them down:

AGG → 115
TGCTGA → 176

I need to find a pattern or a rule that transforms the DNA sequences into these numbers. DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. So each position in the string is one of these four letters.

Let me think about possible transformations. One common approach is to assign numerical values to each nucleotide and then sum them up. For example, A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me test this with the first example.

AGG: A is 1, G is 4, another G is 4. Adding them up: 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115, which is way bigger than 9. So that approach probably isn't correct.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is treated as a digit in a base higher than 10. But what base would that be? Let me think. DNA has 4 nucleotides, so perhaps the numbering is in base 4. But let me check.

Wait, another idea: perhaps each nucleotide is assigned a value equal to its position in the alphabet. A is 1, T is 20 (since T is the 20th letter?), C is 3, G is 7. Let me test that.

Wait, no, the letters are A, T, C, G. So A is the first letter in the DNA alphabet, but in the real alphabet, A is 1, T is 20, C is 3, G is 7. Let me try that for AGG.

AGG would be A (1) + G (7) + G (7) → 1+7+7=15. But the output is 115, which is much larger. So maybe this isn't the right
