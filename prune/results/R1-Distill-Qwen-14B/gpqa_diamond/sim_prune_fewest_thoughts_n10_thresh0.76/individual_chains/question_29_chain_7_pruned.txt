Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's read the problem again carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then sequenced the target gene in all mutants. The changes are in the first exon area. We need to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The goal is to find a mutation that probably disrupts the gene's function. Since the gene is responsible for synthesizing the bad compound, if we mutate it so it doesn't work, the compound won't be made anymore. So we're looking for a mutation that causes a loss-of-function.

Looking at the sequences provided:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3', which is the coding (sense) strand. So the mRNA would be similar but with U instead of T.

The mutants are Mutant 1 to 4, each with a change in the first exon.

Let me compare each mutant to the wild type.

Intact gene: 5’- ... TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT … -3’
Mutant 1: ... TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC …
Wait, let me get the exact changes.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each position.

Looking at the first part, the wild-type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
So, the wild-type sequence from positions 4-10 is TTTCTCG...? Let me see.

Wait, let me write the wild-type and mutants for the region where they've changed.

Wild-type:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1:
ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTA CTT CTG TGC GAT ...

Wait, perhaps looking at each change:

Wildtype: position 4-8 is TTTCT, then CTCGCTGGTACTT...

Wait, perhaps I should line them up.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each mutant's first few bases.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for nonsense mutations or frameshifts, which disrupt the protein.

Looking at the options:

Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Comparing to wild-type (ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’), the differences are:

Wild-type: ...TTTCTCGCT...

Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCT...

So,
