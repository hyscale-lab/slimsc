Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The various Ka values tell us about the strength of each deprotonation step.

So the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. But wait, I think under normal circumstances, especially at around neutral pH (since we're dealing with a solution that's probably buffered?), PO4^3- isn't the major species. Usually, the dominant species are HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Those are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate salts, right? So when they dissolve in water, they dissociate into their respective ions.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4).

So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, considering the phosphate equilibria, these two can interconvert based on the pH.

The key here is to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution. But wait a second, phosphate typically doesn't stay as PO4^3- in solution under most pH conditions because it's a weak base. PO4^3- is a very strong base and tends to pick up protons to form HPO4^2-.

So the presence of PO4^3- would be minimal unless the solution is highly basic, which I don't think it is here because we have a mix of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which suggests a buffer solution in the vicinity of their pKa values.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH of the solution first to see where it lies. Because the pH will determine which species are predominant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the contribution of each salt to the total phosphate concentration and then determine the PO4
