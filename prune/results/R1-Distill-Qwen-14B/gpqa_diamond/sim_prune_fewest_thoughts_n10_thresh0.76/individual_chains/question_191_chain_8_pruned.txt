Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the final product is after a series of reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. So, the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl, right? So that's like CH2–CH(CH2–?), no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So that's CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? Or is it CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond? No, wait. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH–CH2–, but no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2–). Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2–CH2–CH2, but with a double bond between carbon 1 and 2. So it's CH2=CH–CH2–, but the substituent is attached to the second carbon? No, wait, the substituent is attached to the second carbon, so it's CH2–CH2–, but the double bond is from 1 to 2. Hmm, maybe I should draw this. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the group being CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, that might not be. Wait, wait. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=C(CH2–). Oh wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is attached to the middle carbon. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, that's
