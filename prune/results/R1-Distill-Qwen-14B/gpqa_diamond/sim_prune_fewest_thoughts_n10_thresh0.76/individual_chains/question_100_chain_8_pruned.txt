Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I remember that C3H6 is either propene or propyne. But wait, wait. Another possibility is cyclopropane, but that would be a cyclic compound. Hmm. Wait, but the first reaction is bromination in the presence of CCl4. Oh, right, that's a typical bromination condition for alkenes. So if A is C3H6, and it's undergoing bromination, it must have a double bond. So the structure is probably propene, CH2=CHCH3. Because cyclopropane would be C3H6 too, but I don't think it reacts with bromine in CCl4 the same way.

So, moving on. When propene (A) reacts with bromine in CCl4, it undergoes addition. The bromine adds across the double bond. So propene has two possible addition products: 1,2-dibromopropane or maybe a cyclic bromonium intermediate leading to the same thing. Wait, but propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCHBrCH3. But wait, isn't that product called 1,2-dibromopropane? So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So what reaction would that be? Oh, probably dehydrohalogenation, an elimination reaction, because when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihaloalkanes) react with strong bases, they eliminate to form alkenes. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When it reacts with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs, removing two Br atoms and a H, forming double bonds.

Wait, the structure of B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when KOH (alcoholic) is added, it will eliminate HBr twice. The possible product would be propene again, but maybe a different isomer if there are alternative structures. Alternatively, wait, propene is already the starting material. Oh wait, maybe the product is something else. Let me think.
