Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but those elements are numbers, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized, right? So I need to check if this state is normalized. The state vector is a column vector with elements -1, 2, and 1. The way state vectors work is that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component should equal 1.

So let's compute that. (-1)^2 is 1, 2 squared is 4, and 1 squared is 1. Adding them up gives 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, wait, that's 6. So this state isn't normalized. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects us to normalize it? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Oh, wait, maybe the state is given as (-1, 2, 1), but not necessarily a unit vector yet. So I think I'll need to normalize it before proceeding. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of squares. So sqrt(6) is the factor. So the actual state vector is [(-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)]^T. That makes sense.

Next, the operators for observables P and Q are given. The matrix for P is:
First row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)
Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))
Third row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)

And the matrix for Q is:
First row: (1, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -1)

The question is asking for the probability of measuring 0 for P and -1 for Q when Q is measured after P.

Wait, no, wait: the measurements are P first, then Q. But the probabilities are for getting 0 in P and -1 in Q. Wait, but when you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on this new state would give the probability of getting -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the joint probability: the probability that, when measuring P and then Q, you get 0 for P and -1 for Q. So let's approach step by step.

First, find the possible eigenvalues and eigenvectors for P. Because when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, and the result is the corresponding eigenvalue.

So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me write out matrix P:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0,
