Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me see what the question is about. The chemist found a white solid, and they have some spectral data to figure out what it is. The options are four different compounds, so I need to analyze the data and see which one fits.

The given data includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR. Let's break each down step by step.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at m/z 158 at 32%. Hmm, wait, that's higher than the molecular ion. Usually, the molecular ion is the highest, but sometimes you get fragments or adducts. The 158 is 156 plus 2? Oh wait, maybe that's a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So if the molecular ion is 156, which might include one Cl, then the M+2 peak would be 156 + 2 = 158, and the ratio would be about 1:3. Wait, no, actually, the ratio of M to M+2 is based on the abundance of Cl. Let me think, if the molecular formula has one Cl, then the ratio M:(M+2) would be 3:1 because for each Cl atom, the chance of having the heavier isotope is 25%. So in the mass spec, the M is 100%, and M+2 is 32%. Hmm, 32% is roughly a third (33.3%), which fits with one Cl atom. So the molecular formula likely includes one Cl. So the molecular weight is 156.

Now, looking at the IR data. The broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests either an alcohol (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid (which also has a broad -OH stretch). But carboxylic acids usually have a very broad peak, sometimes even broader than alcohols. Also, the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That region is typically for carbonyl groups. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester or aldehyde would have a peak in that area. Wait, an aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1700-2800? No, wait, I think aldehydes have a peak around 2800-2720 (the C-H stretch) and the carbonyl is around 1700-1720. But in IR, maybe the exact position can vary. Alternatively, if it's an acid chloride, the carbonyl is higher, like 1800-1850. Since the peak here is at 1720, that could be a carboxylic acid, ester, or
