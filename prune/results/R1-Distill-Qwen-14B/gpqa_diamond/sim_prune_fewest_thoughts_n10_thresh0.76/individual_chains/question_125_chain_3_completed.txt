Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that harmonic oscillators are common in physics, like in springs obeying Hooke's law. So the force here is F = -kr, which for a spring is Hookean.

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are labeled A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I think I should start by recalling the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. In the 3D case, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number. So the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). 

Wait, another way to look at it is that the total quantum number n is the sum of these individual quantum numbers. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Then the energy can be written as E = ħω (n + 3/2). But wait, each state is characterized by n_x, n_y, n_z, but the energy depends only on the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So states with the same n have the same energy.

But wait, the question is about the third excited state. I need to figure out what n is for the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy state. Let's think about the order: ground state is n=0 (since n_x=n_y=n_z=0), first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.

Wait, no, wait. Ground state is the state with the lowest energy, which is n=0. The first excited state is the next higher energy, which would be n=1. So the third excited state would be n=3. Because counting starts at 0: ground is 0 (no excitation), first is 1, second 2, third 3. So n=3 is the third excited state.

So the energy is E = ħω (3 + 3/2) = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the answer.

Now, the second part is the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. That is, how many distinct states (wavefunctions) correspond to the same energy E. Since the energy depends on n, which is the sum n_x + n_y + n_z, the number of states for a given n is the number of ways to choose non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z such that their sum is n.

This is a combinatorial problem. The number of solutions is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ) = (n+2 choose 2). Because it's the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = n. The formula for combinations with repetition. So for n=3, it's (3 + 2) choose 2 = 5 choose 2 = 10.

Wait, let me make sure. For n=3, the number of states is (3+2)!/(2! 3! )= 10. So yes, 10 eigenfunctions.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2) hbar omega, 10. That fits.

Option C: same energy but 3 functions. That's probably not correct because the number is 10.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of the system are given by $E = \hbar \omega (n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2})$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The total quantum number $n$ is defined as $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, and the energy can be rewritten as $E = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{3}{2})$.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second to $n = 2$, and the third to $n = 3$. Thus, the third excited state has $n = 3$. The energy is then:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for a given $n$ is determined by the number of ways to distribute $n$ quanta among the three spatial directions, which is a combinatorial problem. The number of solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = n$ in non-negative integers is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Number of states} = \binom{n + 2}{2}.
\]

For $n = 3$, this becomes:

\[
\text{Number of states} = \binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$.**

Answer: A
