Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I need to use special relativity principles, right? Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Oh wait, the options are A to D, so I need to pick the correct one.

First, the relative speed. I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities directly because you can't have a speed exceeding the speed of light. So the formula for relative velocity is different. The formula is v_rel = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²). Right?

So let's plug in the numbers. u1 is 0.6c and u2 is 0.5c. So the numerator becomes 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c². Let me compute that. 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, and c^2 divided by c² is 1. So the denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel is (0.1c) / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is around 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So the other options, A and B, can be eliminated for the relative speed part.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which includes their kinetic energy and rest mass energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's calculate each astronaut's energy.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait. No, wait. Because gamma is multiplied by the rest mass energy. So actually, E1 is gamma1 * (mass) * c². So the mass here is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait again. Let's make sure. Oh no, wait, the rest mass energy for the first astronaut is their rest energy, which is (2m) c². So the total energy is gamma * (2m c²). So yes, 1.25 * 2m c² is 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy of the system is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 m c², and option D says E=5 mc². So that would point to option C for the energy part.

Putting it all together, the relative speed is approximately 0.14c and the total energy is approximately 5.96 m c². So the correct option should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u_1 - u_2}{1 - \frac{u_1 u_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u_1 = 0.6c \) and \( u_2 = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \( 2m \), Speed \( 0.6c \))
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \( 3m \), Speed \( 0.5c \))
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of both astronauts:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
