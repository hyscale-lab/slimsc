Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the problem itself has two parts, A and B, which I need to solve.

The question says: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism (part A). Then, among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism (part B). The options are given as A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B.

I think I should tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A. First, what is tautomerism? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in a different structure. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, but more commonly, in compounds with adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems. One classic example is the keto-enol tautomerism in carbonyl compounds.

So, I need to look at the two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene where two oxygen atoms are attached, each as ketones. Wait, actually, benzoquinone can refer to two structures: para-benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Or maybe it's another form, but I think the key is that it's a cyclic structure with conjugated carbonyl groups.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So the structure looks like a ring with three O=C-O groups alternating around the ring.

Tautomerism typically occurs when there's a possibility for the migration of a hydrogen. For example, in 1,3-diketones, you can have enol tautomerism. But wait, if the structure is such that the carbonyl groups are conjugated and cannot easily lose a hydrogen, then maybe it won't tautomerize.

Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Let me think about its structure. Benzoquinone is like O=C6H4O, but actually, in the case of para-benzoquinone, it's O=C6H4=O, but wait, that's actually a diketone. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up. Another possibility is that benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ester or diketone. Let me think: Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. So, it's O=C6H4=O, but I'm not sure if that's the right structure.

Wait, no. Benzoquinone is a di-ortho-quinone. So two carbonyl groups are adjacent on the benzene ring, making it a conjugated di-ketone, perhaps? Or maybe it's para, but I think it's actually the cyclohexadienedione structure
