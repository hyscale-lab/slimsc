Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the Sun's neutrino production when the pp-III branch suddenly stops. So, normally, the Sun's energy comes from fusion reactions, right? I remember that the proton-proton chain (pp) is the main source, and there are different branches. The pp-I and pp-II are different parts of the pp chain.

Wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 nucleus. So, if the pp-III branch stops, that affects the production of certain neutrinos. Neutrinos are produced in different parts of the fusion processes, I think.

Neutrinos are mainly emitted in beta decay processes. For example, in the pp-I branch, a proton captures a positron, producing a neutron, a neutrino, and a photon. But wait, wait. The main neutrino emission comes from the decay of boron-8, I think. Oh, and in the pp-III branch, perhaps more high-energy neutrinos are produced?

So, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with higher energies compared to other branches. If that branch stops, then the flux of high-energy neutrinos would drop. The problem is asking about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the flux in these bands would change when pp-III stops.

Wait, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing more of the higher-energy neutrinos. So, band 2 (800-900 keV) is higher energy. Normally, without the pp-III stopping, the flux in band 2 would be higher than in band 1, perhaps? But if pp-III stops, then the higher energy neutrinos would be less.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch are part of the overall solar neutrino flux. If the pp-III stops, the total flux from that part goes away, but other sources like the pp-I and pp-II continue. So, the lower energy bands would remain similar, but the higher bands would drop.

So, the question is about the ratio F1
