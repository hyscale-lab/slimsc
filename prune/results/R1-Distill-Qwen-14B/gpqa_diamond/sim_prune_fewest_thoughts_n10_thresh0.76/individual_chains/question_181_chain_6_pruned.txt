Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, let me think. So the question is about the Sun's neutrino production. The setup is that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. I need to find the ratio of the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), so flux1/flux2.

Wait, I remember that the pp-III branch is one of the proton-proton chains in the Sun's core. The standard pp chain produces neutrinos through several steps. Oh wait, the main branches are pp-I and pp-II. Or wait, maybe pp-III is a different branch? Let me recall. The pp chain primarily produces two main neutrino species: the dominant is from the decay of Beryllium-7 to Lithium-7, which emits a neutrino. But wait, the main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the fusion processes.

Wait, I think the pp-III branch is a minor part of the proton-proton chain, but maybe it's responsible for a specific part of the neutrino spectrum. Oh, right, I think the pp-III branch involves a higher energy stage, maybe leading to a higher-energy neutrino emission.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? Well, the pp-III process would have contributed to the production of neutrinos in certain energy ranges. So stopping it would reduce the number of neutrinos in those bands.

The question is about the flux ratio of two bands. So I need to figure out how each band's flux is affected by the absence of pp-III.

I remember that the solar neutrino spectrum has a peak around 1-2 MeV. The individual branches contribute to different parts of this spectrum. The dominant pp-I branch produces neutrinos at lower energies, perhaps around 0.5 MeV? Or wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Actually, the standard pp chain has steps. The main one is the pp-I branch, which goes via boron-8, right? So in the pp-I process, a proton captures a boron-8 nucleus to form carbon-16, which then emits two positrons and becomes helium-4. But wait, that's part of the process
