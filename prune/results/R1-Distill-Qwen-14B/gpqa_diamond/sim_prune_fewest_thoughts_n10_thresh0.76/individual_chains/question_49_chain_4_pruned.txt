Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions, and I need to determine the products from the given options.

Let me break down each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under acidic conditions and heat. So, the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine and an allyl alcohol. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact mechanisms here, but I think when you have an amine and an alcohol, under certain conditions, they can form a hemiacetal or something like that. Wait, but wait, sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond into a sigma bond. Oh, right, like Cope or Claisen rearrangements, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is an amine. Maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement, but with an amine involved. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the amine and the alcohol form a cyclic intermediate. Let me think about the structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That's (CH3O)2CH-NH2, right? The but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2CH2CH2CH2OH?), no wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2 with a double bond at position 3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, because the "en" is the second position. Wait, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the longest chain has four carbons, double bond starts at C3 (since the 'en' is at 3), so the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, perhaps I should draw it.

But-3-en-2-ol: the formula would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, the longest chain is four carbons, the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So it's CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? Hmm, wait, maybe not. Alternatively, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)
