Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and why a certain fluorescent signal isn't showing up in the mice. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, the question describes a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic vectors have two coding regions in one transcript, often separated by an IRES or a 2A peptide. Here, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', and it's fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. So, each gene is part of the same transcript but is under different regulatory elements.

Looking at the promoters and elements: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element, which I believe allows for internal ribosome entry, so that the receptor can be expressed independently of the ligand's promoter, perhaps in a different cell type or condition.

Then, there are loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. So between the ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. I remember that loxP is a recombination site, and in the presence of Cre, the stop cassette can be excised. Lox2272 is another variant of the loxP site, and Cre can mediate recombination between loxP and lox2272, right?

So the setup is that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed. So in the wild type without Cre, the stop would be there, preventing expression of mCherry and eGFP. But when Cre is introduced, it should remove the stop, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

In the experiment, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10, meaning it's active in neural crest-derived cells, which is where the ligand and receptor were initially expressed.

The question is why there's no green signal (eGFP) observed under the confocal. The eGFP is part of the receptor construct. So we expect that in cells where the Cre is active (like neural crest derivatives), the stop cassette for the receptor-eGFP would be excised, allowing eGFP to be expressed and thus show green fluorescence.

But in the results, they don't see green. Let's think about the possible options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but I don't think this directly affects the expression of the fluorescent proteins. The question is about expression, not function. So probably not A.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it's not on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence in the cells because the eGFP might not be secreted or not reach the membrane. The Western blot uses total proteins, which includes all compartments. If the protein isn't made, that would show on the blot. So if the construct isn't expressed, the Western would show nothing. But the question says they tested the construct expression on Western blot using antibodies. So if it wasn't expressed, they would see no signal. But the question says they used the Western blot and saw a signal proportional to actin loading. So expression is happening. So if the eGFP is properly expressed, it should be visible when the mouse is crossed with Cre. So maybe B isn't the right reason, unless the construct is made but not properly trafficked. But the Western blot would detect the protein, regardless of its location. So if the eGFP is expressed but stuck in the Golgi, you would still see the receptor-eGFP on the Western, but not in the right place for fluorescence. But the question says that the Western blot was used to test expression, and the signal is proportional to actin, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed. So maybe the Western blot showed that the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't fluorescent. Hmm. But the question doesn't specify what the Western blot showed for eGFP. But if the Western blot showed the proteins, then the issue is elsewhere.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which should be strong. The receptor is under an IRES, which is a separate regulatory element. If the enhancer were missing, perhaps the expression levels are too low. But the question says that the antibodies were raised against overexpressed proteins, and they were used to test expression on the Western. So if the enhancer were missing, maybe expression is low, but the Western would still detect it. Maybe the enhancer is not present in the construct, so the expression isn't happening in the right cells. For example, if the CBA promoter isn't active in neural crest cells, then the ligand isn't expressed. But the CBA promoter is supposed to be a strong, constitutive promoter. Alternatively, if the IRES doesn't work, the receptor won't be expressed. But the IRES is supposed to allow expression in a different cell type or condition. Hmm, not sure about this one.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, that's a big problem. If the ORF of the receptor is not in frame with the eGFP, then when the stop cassette is removed, the receptor-eGFP fusion protein would be made, but if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be functional. However, in the vector, the receptor is at the 3' end, and the eGFP is fused at the C-terminus. So in the vector, the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. When Cre is present, it would excise the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed as a single transcript. If the reading frames are not aligned, then the eGFP wouldn't be correctly produced, leading to either no eGFP or a nonfunctional one. Alternatively, the eGFP might not be
