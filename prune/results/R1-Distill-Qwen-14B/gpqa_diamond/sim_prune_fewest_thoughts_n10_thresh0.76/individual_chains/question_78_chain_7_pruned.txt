Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. Hmm, I need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A when a point charge q is moving. The question gives me four options, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me start by recalling what I know about scalar and vector potentials. The scalar potential V is related to the electric field E, and the vector potential A is related to the magnetic field B. Maxwell's equations come into play here, right?

Wait, the setup says the charge is moving with a trajectory s(t), and the observation point is r. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh, so d is the displacement vector between the charge's position at tr and the field's observation point. So d = r - s(tr), but I'm not sure if that's important right now.

The charge's velocity at the generating time tr is v. And the time t is after tr, so t > tr. That makes sense because the electromagnetic effects propagate at the speed of light, so you can't have an effect before the cause.

I remember that the scalar potential V for a moving charge isn't just the Coulomb potential anymore. In the static case, V would be q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, there's a correction term. I think it involves the velocity of the charge and the distance from it.

Wait, there's something about retarded time. Oh, right, because the fields are generated at tr, which is earlier than t. So the potential at time t depends on the state of the charge at tr. The distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point is d. So the time delay is (t - tr), which is the time it takes for the field to propagate.

But how does this affect V and A? Let me think about the expressions. The scalar potential due to a moving charge is given by the same form as Coulomb's law but with a correction. I think the denominator includes a term that accounts for the relative motion between the charge and the observer point.

Wait, I remember a formula where the scalar potential is (q/(4πε₀)) divided by (d c - v·d), where d is the distance. Or maybe it's (d
