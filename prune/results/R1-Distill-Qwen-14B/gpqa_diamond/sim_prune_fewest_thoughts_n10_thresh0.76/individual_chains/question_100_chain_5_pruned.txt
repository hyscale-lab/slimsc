Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let me try to break it down step by step. I remember that these reaction mechanisms can sometimes be tricky, but if I take it one step at a time, I should be able to work through it.

Alright, the problem starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. I think that's propene because propene is C3H6. Wait, or is it propane? No, propane is C3H8. So propene must be the one here. Propene is an alkene, right, with the structure CH2=CH2CH3.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of CCl4. Bromination of alkenes usually leads to dibromination, but wait, I think in CCl4 it's more likely to be an addition reaction. Oh wait, no, wait. For alkenes, bromination with Br2 in CCl4 is a diaddition. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add bromine across the double bond. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Or wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So when a dibromide reacts with alcoholic KOH, it's likely an elimination reaction, E2 mechanism. The two bromine atoms are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form an alkene again. Since we started with 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would give us back propene, but wait, that can't be right because the next steps are different.

Wait, wait, actually, when 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3) is treated with alcoholic KOH, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, eliminating two HBr molecules. So that would form propene (CH2=CHCH3) again. But wait, that's the same as Compound A. So Compound C is propene again? Hmm, but the next step says when compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube, it forms D. I'm
