Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The given data includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. There are four options to choose from.

First, I'll look at the IR data to get some clues about the functional groups in Compound X. The IR peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually suggests the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an amine (N-H), but alcohols are more common in such a range. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group (C=O). The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could indicate aromatic C=C stretching, which suggests an aromatic ring is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, but those are usually broader and might appear around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but another thought: sometimes the aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but here it's 10.5. Hmm.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are doublets, likely from an aromatic ring with two substituents. The integration is 2H each, so perhaps a para-substituted aromatic ring. Let me think: if it's para, then each substituent is on opposite carbons, so the coupling would give two doublets. Maybe something like two substituents on a benzene ring, opposite each other.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet here. Could be a methylene group adjacent to another group, maybe a carbonyl. Like a CH next to a carbonyl, as in a ketone or aldehyde?
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps a methylene group adjacent to something else, maybe a CH2 connected to another CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, a doublet. That sounds like a CH(CH3) group. Like an isopropyl group or a sec-butyl group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal methyl group, like the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: the aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each being a group that doesn't split the signals into more peaks. The substituents on the ring are probably groups like -COOR (ester), -COOH (carboxylic acid), or maybe an aldehyde group (-CHO). But wait, the aldehyde proton is at 10.5, which is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.
