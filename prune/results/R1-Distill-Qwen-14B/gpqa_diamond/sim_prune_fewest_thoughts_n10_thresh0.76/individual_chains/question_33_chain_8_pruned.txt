Okay, so I have this cycloaddition reaction to figure out. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is done under heat. The question is about identifying the exo product of a [4+2] cycloaddition. Hmm.

Wait, [4+2] cycloaddition... Oh right, that's a Diels-Alder reaction. So the diene and the dienophile are reacting here. But wait, in this case, which is which? Let me think. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with sulfur, and furan-2,5-dione is a cyclic dienophile, I believe. Or wait, no, furan-2,5-dione is a dienophile? Or is it acting as the diene? Hmm, I might be getting this mixed up. 

Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile (like a double bond). Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups and is a conjugated dienophile because the double bond is between the two oxygens, right? So the dienophile would be the furan-2,5-dione, and the diene would be 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Wait, no, wait. Thiophene has a conjugated diene structure. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, so it can act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. 

Wait, but in a [4+2], the dienophile is the component with a double bond that's more electron-deficient. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups, which are electron-withdrawing. That makes the double bond more reactive as a dienophile. So the dienophile is the furan-2,5-dione, and the diene is the thiophene.

So the reaction is between 2,5-dimethylthiophene (the diene) and furan-2,5-dione (the dienophile). Under heat, this should form a cycloadduct via Diels-Alder. But wait, Diels-Alder typically requires heat or some conditions, but some are thermally allowed.

Wait, but in this case, the diene is the
