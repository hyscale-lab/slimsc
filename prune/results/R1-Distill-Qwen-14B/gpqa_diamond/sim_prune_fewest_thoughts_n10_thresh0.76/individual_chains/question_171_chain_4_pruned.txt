Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that electrophilic substitution involves adding a substituent to an aromatic ring. The question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction yield for six different substances when they undergo this reaction.

Wait, the problem says that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative forms. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the one with the least para yield comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Each compound is a benzene ring with a substituent. Let's list them:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzene with ethyl ester)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

I think the key here is to determine the directing effects of each substituent. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta-directing.

So, each substituent directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions. For bromine substitution, the position (ortho, meta, para) depends on the substituent's directing effects.

The para-isomer's yield depends on whether the substituent is para-directing. But wait, also, activating groups increase the overall rate of substitution, but deactivating groups slow it down.

But wait, in bromination, the substituent's effect is crucial. Let me list each substituent's directing and activating/deactivating nature.

1) CH3: -CH3 is an activating group because it's an alkyl group, which is electron-donating via induction. It's ortho/para-directing. So, it directs the incoming Br to ortho and para positions more than meta.

2) CO-O-C2H5: The ester group is a meta director. Because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing, making it deactivating. Ester groups are meta-directing.

Wait, wait. The substituent is a COO-R group, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So, it deactivates the ring and is meta-directing. So, when substituting, the Br would add in meta positions more. So, in the case of bromination, with substituent at COOEt, the para position would have lower yield compared to if the substituent was ortho/para directing.

3) Cl: Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group, but wait, it's also ortho/para-directing. Because in Cl, the inductive effect is electron-withdrawing (deactivating), but the resonance effect is electron-donating (activating for substitution). Wait, no, for halogens, it's more about the inductive effect. Oh wait, halogens are actually deactivating but ortho/para-directing. So, Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. So, for Cl-substituted benzene, the incoming Br will go to ortho and para positions more than meta.

4) NO2: Nitro is a strong deactivating group and meta-directing. So, Br will add more in the meta positions relative to ortho and para.

5) C2H5: Similar to toluene. The ethyl group is activating (alkyl, EDG), so it's ortho/para-directing. So, Br tends to add in ortho and para positions, with para being a major product perhaps.

6) COOH: Carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the COOH group. It's meta-directing. So, Br would add in meta positions more.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, we need to see which substituents direct more towards para.

Wait, but wait. The para and ortho positions are possible only if the substituent is ortho/para-directing. If the substituent is meta-directing, then para is not a major product.

So, the substituents which are ortho/para directors will have more para substitution, while meta directors will have less.

But also, the activating groups increase the rate of substitution, but in terms of regiochemistry, for the given substituent, whether it's ortho/para.

Let me think about each substituent:

1) CH3: ortho/para-directing. So, bromine can go para. So, the para isomer will have a significant yield.

2) COOEt: meta-directing. So, bromine goes to meta, so para is not formed. So, para-isomer yield is low.

3) Cl: ortho/para-directing. So, para is formed, though perhaps less than ortho.

4) NO2: meta-directing. So, para is not formed much; the main product is meta. So, para isomer's yield is low.

5) C2H5: activating, ortho/para. So, para is a major product.

6) COOH: meta-directing. Para is not formed much.

So, the substituents that are ortho/para directors would have higher para yields, and those that are meta directors would have lower.

But wait, there's another aspect. The substituent's activating or deactivating nature affects the rate, but for the purpose of this question, it's about the regiochemistry, i.e., where the substitution occurs.

So, the para yield depends on the substituent's ability to direct the incoming Br to the
