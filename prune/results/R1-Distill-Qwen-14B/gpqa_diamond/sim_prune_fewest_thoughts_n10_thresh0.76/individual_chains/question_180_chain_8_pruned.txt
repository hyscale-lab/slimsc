Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Hmm, I remember something about electric potential energy between charges. 

So, the setup is: there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, 2e means twice the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. That would be 3.2e-19 C each.

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the 13th is at the center, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from it. But wait, the 12 are all at 2 meters from P, so they form a sort of shell around P? Or maybe they're placed symmetrically in some way.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. I think the minimum energy would correspond to the configuration where the potential energy is the lowest. Because when you bring charges together, you do work against their repulsion, which increases the potential energy. So the initial state, perhaps when all charges are as far apart as possible, might have the least energy? Or wait, noâ€”since all the charges are fixed except the 13th, which is fixed at P. Wait, no, the 13th is fixed, and 12 are constrained at 2m from P.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The system is isolated, so energy changes can't come from outside. The charges are all 2e, so same sign, right? So they repel each other. So the potential energy is going to be positive because you have like charges.

So the total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P, each of those 12 has a distance of 2m from P. But what about the distance between the other charges themselves? If the 12 are all at 2m from P,
