Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says we've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So each charge is twice the elementary charge, right? I remember e is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. The masses are negligible, which I guess means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”probably just focusing on electric potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. And the question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with different values.

Hmm. So I think I need to calculate the electric potential energy of this configuration. Since it's an isolated system, the total energy would be the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait. So the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those 12 is 2 meters from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So the 13th charge is interacting with each of the 12 charges, but what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Oh, right! Because even though the 12 are all at the same distance from P, each of them is also interacting with the others. So their mutual repulsion contributes to the potential energy as well.

So the total potential energy is the sum of two parts: the energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, plus the energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but wait. Since the 12 charges are constrained at 2 meters from P, and since their positions are fixed, perhaps their mutual distances can be considered. Wait, but they're all at the same point? No, no, because they are each 2 meters from P, but their arrangement could be in a sphere around P. But if they are identical and the problem doesn't specify their exact positions relative to each other, perhaps we can assume they
