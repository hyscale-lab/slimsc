Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what a density matrix is. From what I remember, a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). Pure states are represented by projectors like |ψ><ψ|, and mixed states are statistical ensembles of those.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, so each term is a projector for the basis states |0> and |1>, each multiplied by 1/2. I think this is a maximally mixed state because each basis state contributes equally, and the coefficients add up to 1.

Now the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. Wait, what's the geometrical representation of density matrices? Oh right, in the Bloch sphere representation, any single qubit state can be visualized as a point on or inside a unit sphere. For pure states, it's on the surface, and for mixed states, it's inside.

The Bloch vector r is a way to represent the state. For a general qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space with components (x, y, z), each ranging between -1 and 1.

So let's write ρ in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1,0, and |1><1| is diagonal with 0,1. Adding them gives [1,0;0,1], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ becomes (I)/2.

Wait, then ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2. Because if I expand ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, then for this case, the r vector must be zero. Because there are no σ_x, σ_y, or σ_z terms. Because when you expand (I + r·σ)/2, it includes all three Pauli matrices multiplied by their respective components of r.

So, if ρ = (I)/2, that would mean r is (0,0,0). Because any non-zero r would add some terms from the Pauli matrices. So the Bloch vector r is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The density matrix ρ is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 in each diagonal entry. So in Bloch sphere terms, that would correspond to the completely mixed state. The completely mixed state is the furthest from the pure states, which would be at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin. So yes, r is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is equally likely to be in the states \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit can be visualized as a point on or inside the unit sphere. For pure states, the point lies on the surface, while for mixed states, it lies inside.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a vector in three-dimensional space. The components of \(\mathbf{r}\) determine the position of the state in the Bloch sphere.

For the given density matrix, expanding \(\rho\) shows that it simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

This implies that there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices (\(\mathbf{r} = 0\)), meaning the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).
