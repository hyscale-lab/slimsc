Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. So the question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². That probably means the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. 

The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, within a sphere of radius R. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember something about Gauss's Law from my electromagnetism class. Oh right! Because divergence is involved, and the field is radial. Gauss's Law relates the integral of the divergence over a volume to the flux through the surface, right? But wait, Gauss's Law is specifically for the divergence of an electric field. But maybe the same principle applies here since the field is radial and depends on 1/r².

Let me think. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates for a radial field (only r component) is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Since the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it's radial, the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Simplifying that, r² * 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, the divergence ∇·f is zero everywhere except at the origin, maybe?

Wait, but that's if the function is smooth everywhere. What if the origin is inside the sphere of radius R? Oh, right, because the vector field is given as 1/r², which suggests that at r=0, it's singular. So the divergence might have a delta function or something at the origin. But wait, in this problem, the volume integral is over the sphere, so if the divergence is zero except at a single point, the integral might not capture that. Or perhaps, when integrating, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, and the integral gives a value based on the flux through the surface.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this more methodically.

The problem is to compute the integral ∫ (∇ · f) dV over a sphere of radius R. Using the Divergence Theorem (which is the 3D version of Gauss's Law), this integral is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

So, according to the Divergence Theorem:
∫ (div f) dV = ∫ f · dA over the surface.

But wait, the Divergence Theorem holds for vector fields that are continuously differentiable everywhere inside and on the surface of the volume. However, in this case, the field f(r) is 1/r², which is singular at r=0. So if R is larger than zero (i.e., the sphere encloses the origin), the divergence isn't well-behaved everywhere inside. So perhaps the Divergence Theorem isn't directly applicable, but maybe we can still compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the divergence is zero except at the origin, so the integral would be zero. But wait, that's not correct if the field is non-zero but has a divergence that's a delta function at the origin.

Wait, let's think again. If the field is f(r) = (1/r²) er, where er is the radial unit vector. So the divergence of this field in spherical coordinates would be:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r)
= (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²))
= (1/r²) d/dr (1)
= (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

So in regions where r ≠ 0, the divergence is zero. But wait, that's not considering the origin. So if the sphere of radius R encloses the origin, then the divergence isn't zero at r=0. But in the integral, when you integrate over the volume, the function is zero everywhere except at a point, which has measure zero in integration. So the integral would be zero.

But wait, that's assuming the function is zero everywhere except at a point. But that's not correct because the divergence is actually not zero in the origin—it's a point where the function isn't defined. So perhaps the problem is considering the field outside the origin, but the volume integral might pick up a contribution from the origin.

Alternatively, maybe the field is such that its divergence is a delta function at the origin. For example, in the case of the electric field due to a point charge, ∇·E = rho/epsilon_0, which is a delta function at the origin. But in our case, the field is f(r) = 1/r², which is similar to the electric field of a dipole? Wait, no. The electric field of a point charge is proportional to 1/r². So perhaps in this problem, the divergence is a delta function scaled by some constant.

Wait, let me do the divergence calculation again. f(r) = 1/r² er. So calculating ∇·f:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But that can't be right because, for a point charge, the divergence would be non-zero at the origin. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. For a point charge, the electric field is proportional to 1/r², and its divergence is zero except at r=0, but when you enclose the origin, the divergence's integral over the volume is non-zero.

Hmm, perhaps I should instead compute the flux of f through the surface of the sphere and see what that gives.

So, using the Divergence Theorem, even if the field is singular at the origin, if the field is continuous everywhere except at the origin, then the integral of the divergence over the volume (which excludes the origin) would be equal to the flux through the surface. But wait, in this case, the divergence inside the volume (excluding origin) is zero. So the flux would be zero, leading the integral to be zero.

But wait, another approach: compute the flux of f through the surface of the sphere. The flux is the integral of f · dA over the surface. Since f is radial and points outward, and the surface is a sphere, the dot product simplifies to f * dA. So flux = ∫ f dA.

f on the surface is 1/(R²). The surface area of a sphere is 4π R². So flux = (1/R²) * (4π R²) = 4π.

So the flux is 4π. But according to the Divergence Theorem, the volume integral of the divergence equals the flux. So ∫ (div f) dV = 4π.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that divergence is zero everywhere except r=0. So how does this reconcile? Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the volume integral should be zero. But according to flux, it's 4π.

Ah! So there must be a delta function at r=0. So the divergence is actually 4π δ³(r), or some multiple thereof. Let me check that.

The divergence of a radial field f(r) = F(r) e_r is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)). So for F(r) = 1/r², the divergence is:

(1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0. So except at r=0, divergence is zero, but considering the origin, perhaps the divergence isn't zero there. But wait, how? The function is undefined at r=0, but the integral over the volume includes the origin only if R > 0.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the field isn't actually divergence-free. Because when you integrate the divergence over the entire space, you get a certain value. Let me think: if the field is 1/r², then the flux through a sphere of radius R is 4π. But the divergence of the field is zero except at r=0, where it's a delta function scaled by 4π. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r).

So if that's the case, then the volume integral over any region that includes the origin would be 4π. If the region doesn't include the origin, the integral would be zero.

In the problem, the sphere is of radius R and centered at the origin. So if R > 0, the origin is inside the sphere. So the integral would be 4π.

Wait wait, but let's double-check. Let me compute the flux again. The field is f(r) = (1/r²) e_r. The flux through the sphere of radius R would be:

Flux = ∫ (f · n̂) dA = ∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ (since n̂ is e_r, and the dot product is 1. So the integral is 1/R² multiplied by the surface area 4π R². So 4π R² * (1/R²) )= 4π.

So the flux is 4π. So according to the Divergence Theorem, the integral of the divergence over the volume is equal to the flux, which is 4π. So the answer would be option A) 4π.

But wait, earlier I thought that divergence is zero except at the origin. So if the sphere doesn't include the origin, the integral would be zero. But in this problem, the sphere is centered at the origin, so R must be positive, so the origin is included. Therefore, the integral is 4π.

So the correct answer is A) 4π.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin, we analyze the problem as follows:

The vector field is given as **f(r) = (1/r²) êᵣ**, where **êᵣ** is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a radial vector field **f(r) = F(r) êᵣ** in spherical coordinates is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F(r) \right).
\]

For **F(r) = 1/r²**, the divergence becomes:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0,
\]

except at **r = 0**, where the field is singular. Thus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin.

To compute the volume integral of the divergence, we use the **Divergence Theorem**, which states:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_{\partial V} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dA,
\]

where **∂V** is the surface of the sphere of radius **R**. The surface integral of **f(r)** over the sphere is:

\[
\int_{\partial V} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dA = \int_{\partial V} \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA,
\]

since **f(r)** is radial and aligns with the outward normal **êᵣ** on the surface. The surface area of the sphere is **4πR²**, so:

\[
\int_{\partial V} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
\]

Thus, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface, which is **4π**. This result arises because the divergence of **f(r)** is effectively a delta function at the origin, contributing to the integral when the sphere encloses the origin (i.e., **R > 0**).

Therefore, the volume integral of the divergence of **f(r)** inside the sphere of radius **R** is **4π**.
