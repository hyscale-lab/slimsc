Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the RV (radial velocity) method detecting these planets.

The RV method measures the shift in the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The shift is periodic, right? So for planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms.

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (or maybe the orbit's orientation). Wait, the formula I think is something like K = (v) = (2π G) / (c T * sqrt(1-e²)) ) * (M_p / M_s) * ( (1 + M_p/M_s)^(-1) ) or something like that. But since the planets have similar masses and the stars are same, maybe some terms can be simplified. Oh, and the orbits are circular, so e=0, so the sqrt(1-e²) is 1, so that term goes away.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude formula is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(1/3) * (4π²)^1/3 * (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(T^(1/3))) ) — No, that's not quite right. Maybe it's better to look at the formula in terms of K.

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (T^(1/3)) )

But since the planet mass is much less than the star's mass, M_p << M_s, so M
