Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons. The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction. What is the angle between the directions of the photons?

Hmm, so the setup is about electron-positron annihilation. I remember that when an electron and positron annihilate, they typically produce gamma photons. Since they are moving towards each other, their combined energy would be converted into the energy of the photons.

Wait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. So each photon has half the total energy? Or is it that their energies are equal but directions are different?

So the key points are Lorentz factors, the direction after collision, and the angle between the two photons.

I think I should start by considering the conservation laws—conservation of energy and momentum. Because in any collision or interaction, these must hold.

Let me break this down. First, calculate the total energy and momentum of the system before the collision.

The electron is moving to the right (from left) with Lorentz factor γ_e =4. The positron is moving to the left (from right) with γ_p =2.

Wait, wait. Wait, the positron is moving from the right along the horizontal axis. So if the electron is coming from the left, moving to the right, and the positron is coming from the right, moving to the left. So they are moving towards each other.

So their velocities are opposite in direction. But when considering momentum, direction matters.

The Lorentz factor is γ = total energy (divided by rest mass energy). The rest mass of an electron (and positron, since they're same mass) is m_e c².

So the total energy of the system before collision is the sum of the energies of electron and positron.

Energy of electron: E_e = γ_e * m_e c² =4 m_e c².

Energy of positron: E_p = γ_p * m_e c² =2 m_e c².

Total energy E_total =4 +2 =6 m_e c².

But wait, wait. Are they moving in opposite directions? So their momenta might cancel each other, but I need to calculate their momenta.

Momentum of electron: p_e = γ_e v_e m_e. Hmm, but v can be expressed in terms of γ. Alternatively, I remember that for relativistic particles, p = γ m_e v, and v = c² / (β γ m_e c² )? Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the relation p = γ m_e v, and v = c * sqrt(1 -1/γ²). Or perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, since I know that the magnitude of the momentum p is γ m_e v, and since v = β c. So p = γ β m_e c.

Wait, another approach: for
