Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem states that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, I remember that l is the orbital quantum number, which for a p orbital is 1. So each electron has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. Then the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for both electrons. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements yield eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Wait, orbital angular momentum for each electron is L1 and L2, right? So L1z is the z-component of particle 1's orbital angular momentum, and similarly L2z for particle 2. Each Lz has eigenvalues mħ, where m can be -l, ..., +l. But here, each electron is in a p orbital, so l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1 for each.

So when we measure L1z and L2z, each can have values of -ħ, 0, or +ħ. The question is, what's the probability that both are -ħ?

Wait, but the state is a coupled state, which is a combination of the individual states. Let me think about how the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is constructed.

In coupled angular momentum states, the total angular momentum |l, m> is formed by combining two individual angular momenta. Each electron has l1 = l2 = 1. So the possible total l values are l = |1-1| to 1+1, which is 0, 1, or 2. The given state is l=2, m=-1.

But wait, the problem involves the individual L1z and L2z. So perhaps I need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states of individual m1 and m2 states. Because L1z and L2z are diagonal in their respective m states.

The coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states. Because when you measure L1z and L2z, you're essentially looking at m1 and m2. So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a superposition of all possible m1 and m2 states where m1 + m2 = -1. Because the total m is m1 + m2.

Wait, because the total m is -1, each m1 and m2 must sum to that. So for each possible m1, m2 is determined. Let me list all the possible m1 and m2 pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

Each m can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron.

So possible pairs:
m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -
