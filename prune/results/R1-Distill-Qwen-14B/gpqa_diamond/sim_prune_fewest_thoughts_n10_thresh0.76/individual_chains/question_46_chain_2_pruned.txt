Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm. Let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I have to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis breaks and reforms double bonds, typically in alkenes. So Grubbs would induce some kind of ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, or maybe cross metathesis.

Wait, wait. The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So, CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But it's 3-methyl, so the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because pent has five carbons. Let me count again.

Wait, for pent-1-ene, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Now, 3-methyl would mean a methyl group is on C3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it properly.

The correct structure for 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, pent means five carbons. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. Then, a methyl group is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's six carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. Let me count correctly.

Wait,
