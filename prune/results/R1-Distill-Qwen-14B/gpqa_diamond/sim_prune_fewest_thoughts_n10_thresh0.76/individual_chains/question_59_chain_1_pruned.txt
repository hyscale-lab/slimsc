Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out if they're reacting and how much excess acid or base is left after the reaction.

Let me list out the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. HCl is a strong acid, so it also dissociates completely. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much.

The first step is probably to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Calculating each:

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.
Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so each mole of it releases 2 OH- ions. Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH-. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

HCl provides H+ ions. Since it's a strong acid, it's 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it's 0.05 moles of H+ (but not all dissociate, but maybe in the reaction, it can contribute? Or perhaps since it's weak, it doesn't react as much. Hmm, maybe I should think about the neutralization first.)

The reaction between H+ and OH-: H+ + OH- → H2O.

But wait, the H+ comes from
