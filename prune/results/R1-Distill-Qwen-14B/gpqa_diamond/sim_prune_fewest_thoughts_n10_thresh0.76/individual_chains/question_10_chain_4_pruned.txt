Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a different planet. My goal is to find out which has the highest density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So density = mass/volume.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Starting with option a: It says it's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. I think Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So if this planet has the same mass and radius, its density should be the same as Earth's. So option a has a density of 5.5.

Moving to option b: The planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. The problem states that it's a density of 5.5, so regardless of mass, that's given. So b's density is 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition implies same density, because density is mass per volume. But wait, if the mass increases, the radius would also increase because the planet would be bigger, but the density remains the same as Earth. Because if you have same composition, you can calculate the density based on mass and radius. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet's density is also 5.5. So c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. Again, same composition, same density. So d is 5.5 as well.

Wait, but that would mean all options a, b, c, d have 5.5 density. But that can't be right because the question asks which has the highest. So I must have misread something.

Wait, let me re-read the options.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So same as Earth, so density 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. Wait, but if the density is given as 5.5, then regardless of the mass, the density is fixed. So it's 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, so same density as Earth, which is 5.5. But 5 times more massive. Wait, same composition implies same density. So the mass is 5 times Earth's, but the volume would be (radius)^3, which scales with mass^(1/density). Hmm, but since the density is the same, the volume would be (5)^(1/3) times Earth's volume. But that's not necessary for this question because the density is same as Earth. So option c's density is 5.5.

Option d: same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So density is same as Earth, 5.5.

Wait, but then all options a, b, c, d have same density? That can't be, because then the highest would be all same. But the options are A to D, each pointing to a to d. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, let's read the options again.

The question says, among the following exoplanets, which one has
