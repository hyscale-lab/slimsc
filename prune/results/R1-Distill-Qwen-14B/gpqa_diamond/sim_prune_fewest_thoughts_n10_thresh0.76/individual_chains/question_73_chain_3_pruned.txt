Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity. 

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. Wait, but relative to what? Oh, right, I think the speeds are given relative to the same inertial frame, maybe the Earth's frame. But the question is about their relative speed. Oh, no, wait, no, the first part asks for the relative speed between the two astronauts. Hmm, no, wait the question says: "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So, the relative speed is the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. I think.

Wait, no, actually, the problem might be the relative speed of the two objects when considering their motion in the same direction. So, if they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't simply the difference of their speeds because of relativistic effects. Oh right, you can't just subtract their speeds in special relativity. So, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The velocity addition formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)), but wait, when v1 and v2 are in the same direction, their relative speed is (v1 - v2) divided by that factor. Wait, no, let me get that right. The formula to find the speed of one object as seen from another is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the object in the Earth frame and v is the speed of the second object in Earth frame, but wait, wait. Oh, actually, I think the formula to find the relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, because the formula is when you have two frames moving relative to each other. So, if the first astronaut is moving at v1 relative to Earth, and the second is moving at v2 relative to Earth, then the
