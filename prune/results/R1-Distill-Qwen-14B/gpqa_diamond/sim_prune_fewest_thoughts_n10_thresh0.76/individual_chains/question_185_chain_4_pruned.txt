Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator and eigenvalues. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ is the Pauli vector, which consists of the Pauli spin matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is a unit vector, meaning it's pointing in some arbitrary direction. ε is an energy constant.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each one has eigenvalues of ±1. So if I have a matrix like σ · n, which is a sum of σ_i multiplied by n_i, maybe that's a similar situation.

So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to the Pauli matrices dotted with the direction n. Since n is a unit vector, the sum σ · n would be a matrix whose eigenvalues depend on the direction, but wait, no. Wait, no—actually, the magnitude of σ · n. Let me think: for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, right? Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1. Let me confirm that. Oh yeah, because the trace is zero, so the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. And since they're 2x2 matrices, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for each σ_i. Wait, but when you take a linear combination like σ · n, which is σ
