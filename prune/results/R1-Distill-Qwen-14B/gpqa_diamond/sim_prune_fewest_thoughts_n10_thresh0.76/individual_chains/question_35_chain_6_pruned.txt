Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It's given that A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is equal to c multiplied by matrix S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is given with its first row as 0 and -i, and the second row as i and 0.

So the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix. To find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I need to solve the equation Ay φ = a φ. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, maybe it's manageable.

Wait, what's the form of S? Let me write it down. S is:

[0  -i]
[i  0]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c = h/(4π), Ay becomes (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So the matrix Ay is:

[ (h/(4π))*0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i    (h/(4π))*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[0       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) 0 ]

So to find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the trace and determinant, or maybe just solve the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]] is λ² - (a+d)λ + (ad - bc) = 0.

In this case, a=0, d=0. So the equation becomes λ² - (0)λ + (0*0 - (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π))) =0.

Wait, bc is the product of the off-diagonal elements. So b is (-i h)/(4π), c is (i h)/(4π).

So bc = [ (-i h)/(4π) ] * [ (i h)/(4π) ] = (-i)(i) (h^2)/( (4π)^2 )

But (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) =1. So bc
