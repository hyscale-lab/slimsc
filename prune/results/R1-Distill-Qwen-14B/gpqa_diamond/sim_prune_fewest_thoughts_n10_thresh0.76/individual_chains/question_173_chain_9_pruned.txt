Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and an electron's energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The question says: An electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy, ΔE. The options are from 10^-18 J up to 10^-16 J.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known. The key equation is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

But wait, since we're talking about the minimum uncertainty, I think we can take the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2. Because that's the minimum possible product; any actual uncertainties would be larger, but for the minimum, we take equality.

So first, I need to find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Once I have that, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, but how does momentum uncertainty relate to energy? Oh right, in the case of an electron moving at a certain speed, its kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is the momentum. But wait, in this problem, the electron has a given speed, but the uncertainty is about the position. So the momentum is
