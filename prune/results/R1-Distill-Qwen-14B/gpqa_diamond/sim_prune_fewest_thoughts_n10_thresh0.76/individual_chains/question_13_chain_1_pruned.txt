Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully and think through each step. 

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It has a structure that's a bicyclic system with a specific configuration. (R)-Limonene is the more common form, found in citrus peels like lemons.

The first step is that the methanol solution of Limonene is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. That sounds like a hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a catalyst, and hydrogen is the reactant, so this is probably a hydrogenation of a double bond. Limonene has a double bond in its structure, so this step is likely hydrogenating that double bond.

Wait, but wait. Limonene has two double bonds? No, no, I think limonene is a bicyclic compound with one double bond. Let me think: Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that includes a six-membered ring and a fused five-membered ring, and it has one double bond. So hydrogenating it would add hydrogen across that double bond.

So, when you hydrogenate a double bond, you get a cyclohexane derivative. But wait, limonene is a bicyclic structure, more specifically, it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure. So hydrogenating that would saturate the ring. The starting structure is (R)-limonene, which is a chiral molecule. After hydrogenation, what happens to the stereochemistry?

Wait, but wait. Let me recall: Hydrogenation of a double bond can either be syn or anti addition, but with Pd/C and H2, I think it's usually a syn addition. But since the starting double bond is in a bicyclic system, hydrogenation would lead to a bicyclic structure with single bonds. So the product after hydrogenation (product 1) would be a bicyclo structure with a single bond where the double bond was.

Wait, but limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So upon hydrogenation, it becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So product 1 is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane
