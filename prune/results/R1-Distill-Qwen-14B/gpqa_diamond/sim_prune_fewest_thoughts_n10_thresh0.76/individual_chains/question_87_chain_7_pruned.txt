Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbons in total. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, okay, so I need to think about what this structure looks like.

First, the aromatic ring is 6-membered, which is typical for benzene rings. Di-substituted means two substituents are attached. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. Let's calculate. The benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the substituents themselves have more carbons. Oh, wait, no. Because the ring itself is 6 carbons, and the substituents are attached. So if it's di-substituted, each substituent can be a group like -X or another group that adds to the total.

Wait, wait. The question says 8 carbons in total. So 6 from the ring, plus the substituents. So substituents must add up to 2 carbons. Because 6+2=8. So each substituent is probably a group with one carbon each, but perhaps? Let me think. Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

Wait, wait. Each substituent can contribute carbons. For example, if one substituent is a methyl group (-CH3, 1 carbon) and another is a carbonyl group like a ketone or aldehyde. But wait, the FTIR mentioned a carbonyl group, so that's a C=O. So one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an acetyl (-COCH3) or maybe a ketone group like in acetophenone.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has two substituents. Let me think. If one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, and another is a halogen, because the FTIR shows an aromatic-halogen bond. So maybe one substituent is a halide (like Cl, Br) and another is a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but each substituent is attached to the ring.
