Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. The question describes a series of reactions, and I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product.

Let me break down each step.

First step: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine, forming product 1. I remember that cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When you treat a ketone with bromine, I think it's an addition reaction. Oh wait, bromine can add to carbonyl groups, right? So cyclohexanone has a C=O. Adding bromine (Br2) would probably form a dibromide. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Do I get a bromohydrin or a 1,2-dibromide?

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's the formation of a bromocyclohexane? No, that's when using HBr or something. Oh, right! When a ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with bromine in a non-polar solvent, like maybe in a Diels-Alder scenario? Or wait, no, that's for dienes. Alternatively, I think it's the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl group. So the carbonyl O becomes an OBr, and the adjacent carbons get Brs.

Wait, no, wait. The structure of cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. Adding Br2 would add across the carbonyl. So the O would have two Brs attached? Or maybe each of the carbonyl carbons adds a Br. Let me get this right. The reaction is:

O
||
C-R becomes CBr2-R-O?

Wait, no. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen attacks Br2, opening it up. So the carbonyl becomes a bromoalcohol, but wait, no, perhaps in this case, it's adding two Brs across the double bond.

Wait, maybe it's a bromide addition. The carbonyl group (C=O) would add Br2, leading to a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane derivative. So the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Or maybe bromocyclohexanol? No, wait, I think the addition is a 1,2-dib
