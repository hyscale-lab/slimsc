Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear decay. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. I remember that in nuclear decay, the energy of the emitted particles depends on the conservation laws, like energy and momentum. Also, particles like E and V could be electrons and neutrinos, but I'm not sure. Wait, E is probably an electron because it's denoted by E, but I'm not certain.

The problem says that the total energy spectrum of E particles is continuous, with some endpoint Q. So for the original decay, the E particles have a continuous range of energies up to Q. I think that's because each E can take a range of energies as the decay conserves energy and momentum. But why is it continuous? Oh right, in beta decay, for example, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy. So the maximum energy (endpoint) occurs when the neutrino's energy is zero, but that's not possible, so the electron can't actually reach that maximum. Wait, no, in beta decay, the maximum energy is when the neutrino takes almost nothing, so the electron gets the maximum possible energy. But wait, in the original decay here, the E particles are emitted along with V particles. So maybe V is something like a neutrino.

Now in the variant decay, it's 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Oh, M is a massless exotic particle instead of 2V. So the number of particles emitted has changed. Originally, it's two V's, but now it's one M. I'm trying to think how this affects the energy spectrum of E.

So in the original case, each E particle's energy depends on the distribution of energy and momentum shared between the E's and V's. Since V is a lighter particle, perhaps they carry away some energy and momentum. But now, instead of two V's, we have one M which is massless. How does that change things?

Wait, in the original decay, the E particles are lighter and the V's are much lighter. So when two E and two V are emitted, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since V is much lighter, maybe their energy is much less than the E particles
