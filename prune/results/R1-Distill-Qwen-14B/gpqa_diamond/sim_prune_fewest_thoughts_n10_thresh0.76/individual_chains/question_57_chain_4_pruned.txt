Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The electrons are 50 MeV and are elastically scattered from a nuclear target. We're supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, which I guess means we only consider these five given ones. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, what's the scattering amplitude again? From what I remember, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) in quantum mechanics is a complex quantity. It's given by a sum over the partial waves. The formula, I think, is something like f(θ,φ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i l φ} [ (e^{i δ_l} - 1) a_l ], where a_l is the s-wave, p-wave, etc., but wait, maybe a_l is just 1 in this case? Or am I mixing things up?

Wait no, another thought: I think the scattering amplitude f can be written as a sum over Legendre polynomials multiplied by e^{i δ_l}, right? Or maybe it's f = Σ ( (e^{i δ_l} - 1) ) (something with Legendre polynomials). Hmm, perhaps it's better to recall the general expression.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} ]

Where k is the wave number, l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, P_l are the Legendre polynomials, and δ_l are the phase shifts. So each term in the sum corresponds to a partial wave with angular momentum l.

But wait, the question asks specifically for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident beam direction is when the scattering angle θ is zero, right? So θ=0, which means the electron is scattered directly along its original path. So along the beam direction, φ would be zero as well, because the scattering
