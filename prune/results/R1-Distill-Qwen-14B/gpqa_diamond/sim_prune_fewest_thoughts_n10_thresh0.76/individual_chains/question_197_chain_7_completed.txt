Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and IR spectroscopy. Let's take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember from my notes that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh, right—when a nitrile is treated with HCl (like in the hydrolysis), it can form an amide or a carboxylic acid. But wait, red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines as well. No, wait, when you have a nitrile and you use H2O and red phosphorus, it's a hydrolysis to the amide, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's another reaction—I think when nitriles react with HX (like HI), it's for some kind of substitution, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. The reaction is usually called the Stephen reduction? No, I think that's when you reduce a nitrile to an amine. Wait, no, Stephen reduction is when you use a catalyst to hydrogenate. Hmm. Maybe I should look at the reagents again.

Oh, right! When a nitrile is treated with red phosphorus and HI (a mixture), it's called the hydrolysis of the nitrile. Wait, no, I think red phosphorus and HI is used for the conversion of nitriles to alcohols. Wait, wait, no. Alternatively, I'm mixing things up. Another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert nitriles into amines. Because I remember that when a nitrile reacts with H-I in the presence of a catalyst like red phosphorus, it can hydrolyze to an amine. Oh wait, that's the hydrocyanation? Or maybe the Baeyer reaction? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should first figure out what Compound X is, and then see what happens when it reacts with those reagents.

So the problem gives the IR and NMR data for Compound X. Let's look at the IR first. The IR peaks are: 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, likely indicating O-H or N-H stretches. But more specifically, in the 3400-2500 range, it could be an alcohol (O-H) or maybe an amide N-H. But looking at the other peaks, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is usually a carbonyl (C=O) group. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions probably indicate aromatic C=C stretching.

So the IR suggests that Compound X has a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, ester, amide, or acid. The 1720 cm-1 is a bit on the higher side for a ketone—usually, ketones are around 1700-1750, so that fits. But an ester might also be around 1720. Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl and a broad peak in IR (3400-2500) might suggest an acid, but the broad peak in IR for an acid is usually a very strong, broad O-H stretch. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) could be an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, a carboxylic acid would be a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, an aldehyde is around 9-10, usually a singlet. But in this case, it's 10.5, broad singlet, which is more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if Compound X is a nitrile, would that fit the IR? Because nitriles have a C≡N stretch around 2200-2260 cm-1. But the given IR doesn't show that. So if the IR doesn't show a nitrile, then maybe Compound X isn't a nitrile. Hmm, that complicates things because the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps the initial assumption about the reaction is wrong?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't about nitriles. Wait, another possibility: when you have a ketone and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, does anything happen? Or maybe it's an elimination reaction? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's look at the NMR. The 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Probably an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. So two protons as a doublet, which would suggest they are on a benzene ring next to substituents.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, maybe the ortho positions to substituents. So maybe the substituents are at the para positions. For example, a para-disubstituted benzene ring.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A methylene or methine group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another set of protons, maybe part of an ethyl group or a substituent attached to the aromatic ring.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A methylene group, perhaps adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, a triplet or a doublet? Oh, it's a doublet, so maybe a CH2 group next to a CH that is split into a doublet. Wait, maybe it's a CH(CH2CH3) group or something like that.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, possibly part of an ethyl chain.

Putting the aromatic protons together: the two doublets (each 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene. So, perhaps the substituents are at the para positions on the benzene ring. Let's say, for instance, that substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para).

Looking at the aliphatic protons:

- The 10.5 ppm is a singlet and broad, so perhaps a carboxylic acid (-COOH) group, which would have a -OH proton. But wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad, so that fits.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would show a strong peak around 1700 cm-1 for the carbonyl. Yes, the IR has a 1720 peak, which fits. So perhaps Compound X is a benzoic acid with some substituents.

But wait, the substituents would be on the benzene ring. So let's think about the NMR. The aromatic region has 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical for a para-substituted benzene. For example, if the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups, the ring protons would be downfield. Let's say, for instance, we have a -COOH group and another substituent on the benzene ring.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH2 group attached to something. Maybe a CH2CH2 group? Or perhaps a CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, let me think. If there's a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone, the protons would be around 2.1 ppm. But in our NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (1H), which could be a CH group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's an acetyl group attached to the benzene ring. For example, the benzene has a substituent like CH2COOH or something similar.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Or perhaps a CH2CH2 group attached. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, looking at the NMR shifts:

- 10.5 ppm: -COOH proton.
- 8.0 and 7.2 regions: para-substituted benzene, perhaps with an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group? But the presence of a carboxylic acid suggests that the substituent is a COOH group. Wait, but in that case, the ring would have substituents at para positions. Let me see: if the benzene has a COOH group at position 1, then substituent at position 4 could be another group, perhaps an ethyl or isobutyl group.

Wait, but the aliphatic protons: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests a CH that's connected to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to that CH, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 connected to a CH2—so maybe a CH2CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH2CH3 group, perhaps. Wait, let me think. The 0.9 t, 3H suggests a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group—CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at the para position which is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Hmm, but let me count the protons.

Wait, the aliphatic region:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): could be a CH connected to a carbonyl. So, maybe a (CH2) group attached to the ring. So, like a benzene ring with a COOH group at position 4, and at position 1, a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like: the benzene ring has a COOH group at one position and a CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3) group at the para position. Wait, maybe it's an isobutyl group.

Alternatively, let's consider that the substituent is a propyl group. Hmm.

Wait, alternative approach: let's try to match the NMR shifts to a possible structure.

The two aromatic doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. Let's say, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

So the substituents are: COOH at position 1, and another group at position 4. Let's see what that another group could be.

Looking at the aliphatic region:

- The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2. Because a CH3 in a triplet would be from a CH2CH2CH3, but here it's a doublet. So perhaps it's a CH(CH3) group attached to another CH2.

Wait, but the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 group, perhaps next to another CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. So maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring.

Wait, that would make the substituent a -CH2CH(CH3) group. But wait, that's only two carbons, so maybe it's a propyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but that doesn't seem to fit the NMR data.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a doublet, which usually comes from a CH3 connected to a CH2, which is next to another CH2 or CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent like CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent would be something like CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think. A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait: the structure of a sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? Wait, no. A sec-butyl group is actually -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, isobutyl is -CH(CH2CH3)2. Oh, wait, no: isobutyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Let me think again. An isobutyl group is a four-carbon substituent where the branching is at the second carbon. So, structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, that's actually a tert-butyl group? No, wait, no: the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, no. Let me clarify:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH2-
- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2-
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- 

Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think of substituents. For example, if the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3), but that doesn't match the NMR.

Wait, the aliphatic region:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH attached to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two protons on a CH2 adjacent to the CH.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH2.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH3 at the end of an ethyl chain.

So, putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Wait, but that would have a CH2 connected to a CH(CH2CH3), which would make the structure like CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So, the substituent would be a pentyl group? Or perhaps a butyl group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group attached to a methyl group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group connected to the benzene. But I'm getting stuck on visualizing this.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group, but that's getting too complicated. Let me think of the substituent as a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps we should think of the substituent as a CH2CH2 group attached to a CH(CH3) group. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the integration:

The 10.5 ppm (1H) is the -COOH proton.

The aromatic protons are 2H each, so four aromatic protons, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents.

So, let's say the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4: one substituent is a COOH group, and the other is a substituent group.

The substituent group would have the following protons:

- The 2.9 ppm (1H) is maybe a CH adjacent to the ring. So, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the ring.

Wait, but how? Let me think:

If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group, then the CH2 would split into a multiplet. The CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH group at 2.9 ppm, and the CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm. But the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that would be a geminal dimethyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent would be a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3). But the NMR doesn't show a triplet for the CH3 at the end (which it would if it's a propyl group). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, which is consistent with a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain.

Wait, so if the substituent is a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group (butyl), the end CH3 would be a triplet around 0.9 ppm. The adjacent CH2 would be a quartet, and the next CH2 would be a triplet, and the CH2 attached to the ring would be a multiplet. But in the given NMR, we have 0.9 (t), 1.4 (d), 1.7 (m), 2.9 (m). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the substituent would be a five-membered group? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group, making it an isopropyl group attached to the ring. But then, the NMR would show a septet for the CH(CH3)2 group, which I don't see here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent would be a -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene ring. But I'm not sure how that would split the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH2 would be split, and the CH group would be at 2.9 ppm. The CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm. But then, what about the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? That would be a CH3 attached to a CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group. So, that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch. But I'm getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a longer chain. Let me think about the substituent as a propyl group, but with a branch. For example, -CH2CH(CH3)2, but that would have a different NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So the structure would be benzene with a COOH group and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group at the para position.

In that case, the substituent would have a CH2 group attached to the ring (at position 4), connected to a CH group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)). The CH2 would couple with the ring, perhaps giving a triplet or multiplet, and the CH would have neighboring protons. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the CH3 group attached to the CH, making a doublet because it's adjacent to the CH. The CH2 attached to the ring would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That seems to fit.

So, the substituent would be a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Wait, but CH2CH(CH2CH3) is a four-carbon substituent, making the substituent a pentyl group? Or perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a four-carbon substituent, but that would be a butyl group with a branch. Wait, but butyl is four carbons, so maybe it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, that's like a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) at position 1, and Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3) at position 4.

Wait, but looking back at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, which would be the CH group in CH2CH(CH2CH3). The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH3 groups would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). That seems to fit.

So, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a four-carbon substituent. Wait, that's a butyl group, but specifically a sec-butyl?

Wait, the structure would be benzene with a COOH group and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group at the para positions. So, the substituent would be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group, which is a four-carbon substituent, making it a butyl group. But I'm not sure if it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options given. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, let me look at these options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. Or wait, Benzoic acid would have the COOH group at position 4, and the substituent is a sec-butyl at position 1. So the substituents are para to each other.

Alternatively, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be benzoic acid (COOH at position 4) and a sec-butyl group at position 1 (para to COOH). So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure of a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), right? Wait, no. Wait, nomenclature: the substituent is named based on the longest chain. A sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no: I think the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not right. Wait, no, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is:

The main chain is four carbons, substituent attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. Wait, for a butyl group, it's four carbons. The substituent is attached to the first carbon (n-butyl), the second carbon (sec-butyl), or the third carbon (iso-butyl). So, the structure for a sec-butyl substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's four carbons. No, wait, the substituent is considered as the longest chain that includes the point of attachment. So, the substituent is a four-carbon group, with the point of attachment on the second carbon. So, the structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the substituent as being an ethyl group attached to a CH group, which is connected to the benzene. For example, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the structure of option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1. So, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, perhaps it's a four-carbon group where the attachment is on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

But that seems too long. Alternatively, perhaps it's a three-carbon substituent with the attachment on the second carbon. So, for a propyl group, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that's a propyl group, not a butyl.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the NMR.

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. So the substituent would have a structure like:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, that's four carbons: benzene attached to CH2, which is attached to CH, which is attached to CH2CH3.

So, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3), which is a four-carbon group with the attachment at the first carbon. Wait, no, because the substituent is a butyl group, so with four carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is at position 4, which is the same as position 1 in the para position.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. Wait, I'm not sure.

But let's think about the NMR.

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's imagine the structure is:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 4 and sec-butyl (four carbons) at position 1.

The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, but that would have a CH2 next to the ring, then a CH with a CH2CH3 group, then another CH2. But that doesn't seem to fit the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR shows the aliphatic protons as:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would be:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-

But that would have a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group.

So, the protons on the CH2 attached to the ring would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH), but the NMR shows the 1.7 ppm as a multiplet of 2H, which could be a CH2 next to a CH.

The CH group would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The CH2CH3 group would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), but what about the CH2 group attached to the CH?

Wait, the CH2 group attached to the CH would be a quartet, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or a CH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would have a CH2 (coupled to another CH2), and a CH group with CH2CH3.

So, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. So, the structure is benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). That's a three-carbon substituent (propyl), but with a branch. Wait, that's actually a isopropyl group attached to a CH2. No, wait, CH2-CH(CH2CH3) is a four-carbon group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which would have the following protons:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: this would be a triplet, but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be that CH2.
- The CH group in CH(CH2CH3): adjacent to the CH2, so it would be a multiplet at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The CH2CH3 group would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The CH2 group attached to the CH would have a triplet or a quartet. The NMR shows 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be the CH2 next to the CH.

But wait, the substituent would be a four-carbon group, which would make it a butyl group. So, the substituent is a butyl group.

So, if the substituent is a butyl group, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps another approach: looking at the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzoic acid is at position 4, and the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 1.

The structure of the substituent (sec-butyl) would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-. So, the substituent is a four-carbon chain, with the point of attachment at the second carbon.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the benzene.

In that case, the aliphatic protons would be:

- The CH2 next to the ring: this would be a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH), perhaps around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH group: at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The CH2CH3 group: triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).
- The CH2 group after the CH: would this be around 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? Hmm, but a CH2 group would split into a quartet or a triplet, not a doublet.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a different group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group. But option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, but that's not a benzoic acid.

Wait, looking back, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl, supporting the presence of a carboxylic acid group (since the O-H would be broad in IR). So, the NMR has a 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is the -COOH proton.

So, the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Among the options, options A and C are benzoic acid derivatives.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the substituent is an ethylphenyl group attached to the propanoic acid. That would imply a longer chain, but the NMR doesn't seem to fit that.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzoic acid.

So, let's imagine the structure: benzene ring with COOH at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 1.

The substituent (sec-butyl) would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached to the ring. So, the protons would be:

- The CH2 next to the ring: triplet, around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH group: around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The adjacent CH2: let's see, if it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-, then the CH2 groups would each have two protons. The CH2 attached to the CH would be around 1.4 ppm, perhaps as a doublet because it's next to a CH group that has a single proton.

Wait, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, which is a four-carbon group. So, the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But that's a three-carbon substituent, which would make it a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a doublet. A doublet suggests two neighboring protons. So, a CH3 group attached to a CH2 that is next to another CH2 or CH group.

If the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, then the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In that case, the protons would be:

- The CH2 next to the ring: this would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH), perhaps around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).
- The CH group: at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The CH2CH3 group: triplet at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

But what about the CH2 in between? The CH2 attached to the CH would have two protons, which would split into a quartet, perhaps at around 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)? No, because a quartet would have four peaks, but the data shows a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is split by the adjacent CH group, leading to a doublet. But a CH2 group with two protons adjacent to a CH group would be a quartet, not a doublet.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the substituent is an isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the substituent would have:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: triplet around 1.7 ppm.
- The CH connected to two methyl groups: perhaps at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).
- The methyl groups: perhaps splitting into a septet, but I don't see that in the NMR.

Hmm, but the NMR doesn't show a septet, so perhaps it's not an isobutyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction part now. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. If Compound X is a benzoic acid, then what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the synthesis of alcohols from nitriles. But wait, if X is a benzoic acid, then it doesn't have a nitrile group. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that X is a benzoic acid.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Let me re-examine the IR and NMR data.

IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That could also be an ester or ketone. The 3400-2500 cm-1 could be an alcohol or amine. But the NMR has a 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is more likely a carboxylic acid than an amine or alcohol. Because alcohols have broad peaks around 1-5 ppm, but a carboxylic acid would be around 10-12.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the IR should have a peak around 2500-3300 cm-1 for the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The given IR data range is 3400-2500, which is a broad range. So, perhaps the 3400-2500 cm-1 is the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid, which is typically broad and around 2500-3300.

So, yes, the presence of a broad peak in IR in that range supports a carboxylic acid.

So, back to the reaction. If the initial compound is a benzoic acid derivative, and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Wait, but the initial compound is a benzoic acid; where's the nitrile?

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that X is a benzoic acid. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the IR at 1720 cm-1 is an ester or ketone. Let's consider that.

If the IR has 1720 cm-1, that could be an ester. The broad peak at 3400-2500 cm-1 could be an alcohol or perhaps an amide. But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more likely a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the IR doesn't show a nitrile, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. So, perhaps X is not a nitrile.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is typically used for nitrile hydrolysis. So perhaps X is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak. Did I miss it?

Looking back at the IR data: 3400–2500, 1720, 1610, 1450. Oh, maybe the 2200-2260 region is missing. So, perhaps X is not a nitrile. That complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't hydrolysis. Maybe it's a substitution. Wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: after the reaction, what products are possible?

The options are all either substituted benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

If the reaction is hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. That's a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent.

So, perhaps the reaction converts a nitrile group into a carboxylic acid group.

But wait, the initial compound X's IR doesn't show a nitrile peak. That suggests that X doesn't have a nitrile group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, another thought: perhaps Compound X is a benzyl chloride or bromide, and the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution with HI. But then the product would have an -I group.

But the options don't show that, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-type reaction? No, that's more about organometallic reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents are used for a different kind of substitution.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting a nitrile to an amine, but that's when you use LiAlH(t-BuO)3 or other reducing agents. Red phosphorus and HI might be used for that, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of Compound X. The NMR shows a 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is likely a carboxylic acid. The aromatic protons are in two doublets, suggesting a para-substituted benzene.

So, perhaps Compound X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that is a branched alkyl group.

In that case, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would do what? Maybe it's a reduction or some kind of substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deprotection. For example, if X is a nitrile that's been hydrolyzed to an amide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But the IR doesn't show an ester peak; the 1720 could be an ester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone. The 1720 could be a ketone. The IR would also have the C=O stretch for a ketone. But the NMR doesn't show any signal that would suggest a carbonyl adjacent to a CH3 group, like in acetone.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenol ester, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. If X is a nitrile, and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. So, the product would have a COOH group where the nitrile was.

But since the IR of X doesn't show a nitrile peak, perhaps X is not a nitrile. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by considering the options and working backward.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is a nitrile derivative, perhaps it's 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, which upon hydrolysis would give 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But the IR of X should have a nitrile peak. The given IR doesn't show a peak around 2200-2260 cm-1, so X is not a nitrile. So that suggests that X isn't a nitrile, so the reaction isn't hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, and X is a benzylic bromide or chloride. For example, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl chloride, then reacting with HI would substitute the Cl with an I, but that's not reflected in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reagents are for a reduction. Red phosphorus is sometimes used in reductions. For example, the reduction of a nitrile to an amine using H2P and HI. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but if X is a nitrile, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, it would form an amine. So, the product would be a benzylamine derivative. But the options don't show any amines; they're either acids or substituted benzenes.

So, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like addition. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by something else, but without more data, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options and the data.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the NMR of X has a 10.5 ppm (COOH), and the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then upon reaction, perhaps the substituent is modified.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a nitrile, then the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid. But the data for X suggests it's a carboxylic acid already.

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. The reaction is: R-C≡N + H2O → R-COOH. The red phosphorus and HI help in the hydrolysis, perhaps acting as catalysts or providing the acidic conditions.

So, if X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. But X's IR doesn't show a nitrile, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an amide, which upon reaction with HCl (or HI) would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. But amide IR would show a strong peak around 1650 cm-1 for the amide C=O. The given IR has 1720, which is higher, more like a ketone or ester.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a ketone. Then, reaction with HI and red phosphorus could lead to some addition or substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where X is an alkyl halide. For example, if X is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction is with HI, the product would be benzyl iodide. But the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alkyne, but that's less likely.

At this point, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that X is a benzoic acid derivative and the reaction doesn't change the carboxylic acid group, but modifies a substituent.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I'm not sure what that would do to a benzoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling that adds something to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group. Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would indicate a nitrile (no peaks around 2 ppm for CH2 near a nitrile).

Wait, another approach: let's think about the reaction product.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, options B and D are substituted benzene rings with no acid groups.

Options A and C have acid groups.

If the reaction is hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be an acid, so options A or C would be the product.

But if the starting material (X) is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But the IR data of X doesn't show a nitrile peak, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis but a substitution. For example, X has a leaving group that is replaced by HI.

But without knowing X's structure, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration or reduction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the NMR and IR data.

The NMR has a 10.5 ppm (COOH), so X is a benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI would then do something to the substituent.

Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid, and the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a protection or deprotection reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile. If X is a benzoic acid with a nitrile substituent, then the reaction would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But that would mean the product has two carboxylic acid groups, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a different group that is converted into a carboxylic acid.

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

If X is a nitrile with a sec-butyl group, then hydrolysis would produce this.

But I don't have any nitrile peaks in X's IR.

Alternatively, perhaps X is the corresponding nitrile, and the reaction produces the acid.

But given that the IR doesn't show a nitrile, perhaps X isn't a nitrile.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester. If X is an ester, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not do anything. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, but that doesn't fit with the NMR data.

At this point, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, because the NMR and IR data suggest a benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction converts a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But without the nitrile in X, I'm not certain.

But wait, perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis but a different reaction. For example, if X is a bromide or iodide attached to a benzene ring, the reaction with HI might do a substitution.

But looking at option D, 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4? Or perhaps a different substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling that adds a substituent.

But I'm not making progress here. I think I need to conclude, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to determine its structure. The IR spectrum shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group, and a broad peak in the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ range, suggesting an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid. The NMR data includes a signal at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The aromatic region (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm, each d, 2H) indicates a para-substituted benzene ring. The aliphatic region (2.9 ppm, m, 1H; 1.7 ppm, m, 2H; 1.4 ppm, d, 3H; 0.9 ppm, t, 3H) suggests a branched alkyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Given the IR and NMR data, Compound X is identified as a benzoic acid derivative with a para-substituted benzene ring and a branched alkyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is typically associated with the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, the IR data does not show a nitrile peak (2200–2260 cm⁻¹), suggesting that Compound X is already a carboxylic acid. This implies that the reaction may modify the substituent on the benzene ring rather than the carboxylic acid group.

Among the options provided, Option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, matches the description of Compound X. The substituent on the benzene ring is a sec-butyl group, which fits the aliphatic NMR data. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not alter the carboxylic acid group but may modify the substituent. Based on the analysis, the final product is consistent with Option C.

Answer: C
