Okay, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21 and purify it quickly. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence, and I have four plasmid options to choose from. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure out which plasmid is the right one.

First, I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid should have a strong promoter, preferably inducible like the T7 promoter, because BL21 strains are T7 RNA polymerase-dependent. Also, the plasmid should have an origin of replication compatible with E. coli. Oh, and the gene should be under a promoter that's recognized by E. coli's machinery, but wait, BL21 strains don't have the T7 polymerase unless induced. Oh right, the plasmid likely has a T7 promoter so that when we add IPTG, the gene is expressed.

Looking at the options, each plasmid starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The initial sequences look similar. Wait, probably the options are designed to have the correct reading frame and proper RBS (ribosome binding site) for E. coli. But how do I tell them apart?

I think I should look for the presence of the T7 promoter. The T7 promoter sequence is usually around GGCCACCACTG (or something similar). Let me look at the beginning of each option.

Wait, the very beginning, right after ATG, in option A, the sequence is GAGGAGCCGCA. Hmm, I'm not sure. The T7 promoter is usually before the ATG, but in the plasmid, it's part of the vector. Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid has a T7
