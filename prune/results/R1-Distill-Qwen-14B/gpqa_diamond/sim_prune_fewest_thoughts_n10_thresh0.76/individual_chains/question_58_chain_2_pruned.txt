Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about theories that don't need regularization. Hmm, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work and get finite, meaningful results. So, the idea is that some theories naturally don't have these divergences, or perhaps they're already handled in a different way, so you don't need to regularize them.

Looking at the options: A is Superstring Theory, B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D is Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, let's think about each theory.

Starting with Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), which is option C. I know QED is a quantum field theory that deals with electrons and photons. It's known to be renormalizable, right? So they have to do renormalization to deal with the infinities. But wait, do they need regularization? I think regularization is a part of the process they use before renormalization. So QED does require regularization because of loop divergences. Like, when you calculate loop diagrams, you get integrals that blow up, so you need to regularize them, maybe using a cutoff, dim reg, or something else.

Then there's Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), option B. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. It's also a quantum field theory, and I remember it's asymptotically free. Because of this, at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, so perturbative methods work. But wait, does QCD require regularization? I think it does because of issues like confinement and the non-abelian nature of the gauge group. But maybe the divergences are handled differently. Or perhaps because it's a non-abelian theory, there's more structure, but I'm not sure if that avoids regularization. I think QCD still needs regularization, especially in lattice calculations or when dealing with things like running coupling and beta functions.

Superstring Theory, option A. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. I remember that in string theory, the fundamental objects are
