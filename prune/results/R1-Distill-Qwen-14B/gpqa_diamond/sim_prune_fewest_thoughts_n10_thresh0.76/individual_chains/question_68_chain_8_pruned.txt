Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. So, the particle's moment is aligned with the field. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, oscillation frequency? So, the z-component starts oscillating when the magnetic field changes direction. I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the spin state will precess around the new field direction. Precession usually leads to oscillations in certain components. Since the new field is in the Y direction, the spin will precess around Y. But what does that mean for the z-component?

Let me recall the basic concepts. For a spin-1/2 particle, the magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin angular momentum S. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. Oh wait, but the question says mu = gamma * S_z. Hmm, that's a bit different. Usually, I think mu is proportional to the entire spin vector, like mu = gamma * S. But here, it's given as mu = gamma * S_z. That might be a simplification or specific to this scenario. I'll have to keep that in mind.

Initially, when the magnetic field is along +Z, the spin is aligned with it. So the state is an eigenstate of S_z. The energy is E = -mu 路 B. Since mu is aligned with B, the system is in its lowest energy state.

When the field is suddenly switched off, and then turned on along +Y, the spin will adjust. But the change is sudden, so the spin direction doesn't change immediately. But the field now is along Y, so the Hamiltonian changes.

The Hamiltonian in a magnetic field is H = -mu 路 B. Originally, mu was along Z, so H was proportional to S_z. After the switch, H becomes proportional to S_y because B is along Y. Oh wait, but in this problem, mu is given as mu = gamma * S_z. So, H after the change is H = -gamma * S_z * B_y, but B_y is along Y, so wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, mu is given as gamma * S_z, but the magnetic field is along Y. So the dot product would be mu 路 B = (gamma S_z) 路 B. Since B is along Y, B is (0, B, 0), so the dot product would be gamma S_z * 0 + gamma S_z * B * 0 + gamma S_z * 0? No, wait, no. Wait, no, S_z is a component of the spin vector. So, mu is a vector, right?

Wait, no, wait. The problem says mu = gamma * S_z. Oh, that's confusing. Because S_z is a component of S. So, mu would then be a vector whose only component is gamma * S_z. That seems a bit odd, but I'll go with it.

Wait, hold on. No, that doesn't make sense. Because in reality, the magnetic moment is a vector, so mu would be gamma times the entire spin vector S, not just S_z. So perhaps the problem statement is simplified, and mu is proportional to the component along the current field direction. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the problem is saying that mu is proportional to S_z, but the field is in another direction. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial condition is that the magnetic moment is along Z, but then the field is changed to Y. So the initial state is |+z>, and then the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. Because the magnetic field is along
