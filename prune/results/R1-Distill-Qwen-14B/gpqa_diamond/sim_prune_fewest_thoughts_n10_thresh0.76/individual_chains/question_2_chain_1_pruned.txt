Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, so I'll have to think carefully.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a benzene ring connected to a propenal group (CH₂=CHCHO). The trans isomer would mean that the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other, but wait, wait—cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylpropenal. So the structure is a benzene ring attached to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO group? No, wait, actually, the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but no, wait again. No, wait—no, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH=O. Wait, no—cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? Or Ph-CH=CH-CHO? Oh wait, no. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with the structure where the aldehyde group is attached to a propenyl group. So it's benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I should get the structure right. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, that can't be. Wait, no. It's Ph-CH₂-CH=CHO? No. Maybe it's Ph-CH₂-CHO, but that's not right. Wait, no. Let me think. The formula for cinnamaldehyde is C9H8O. So a benzene ring (C6H5) attached to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO would have 6 + 3 + 1 = 10 carbons. But wait, the formula is C9H8O. So maybe it's C6H5-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that would be 9 carbons. Wait, wait, no. C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, that would be C9H6O, but the formula is C9H8
