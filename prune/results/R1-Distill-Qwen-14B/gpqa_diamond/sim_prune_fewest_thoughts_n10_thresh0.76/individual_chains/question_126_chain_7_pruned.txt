Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions, I and II. Each uses a different starting material and reagent. After both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction produces.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH, then acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone group on C3 and a methoxy group on C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3 or something like that. Wait, no, hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2CO, so position 3 is the ketone. Then, position 5 is methoxy.

When LAH reduces the ketone, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So Reaction I should produce (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, the starting material is a chiral center? The (S) configuration is at C5 because the methoxy is on C5. So, when the ketone (C3) is reduced to an alcohol, that introduces a new chiral center at C3. So the product will have two chiral centers now: C3 and C5.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, the actual structure is more like:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the substituents on the carbonyl carbon (C3) are a CH2CH2 group and a CH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps I should number it properly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan
