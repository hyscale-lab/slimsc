Okay, so I've got this question about vector fields and their divergence. Hmm, let me think about it. I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence has something to do with the sources or sinks of a vector field. Oh right, divergence measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point.

The question says that the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So f is a radial vector field, which is good to note.

The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R. So the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of the sphere.

Wait, I remember the divergence theorem. It relates the volume integral of divergence to the flux through the surface. So according to the divergence theorem, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector. But wait, in this case, I might not need to compute the flux because I might be able to find the divergence directly and integrate it.

Let me think about finding the divergence of f. Since f is radial and depends only on r, which is the distance from the origin, I can use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. Oh right, for a vector field that's purely radial and depends only on r, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), where f_r is the radial component.

So f(r) = 1/r². So f_r = 1/r². Then the divergence ∇ · f would be (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Let me compute that. The expression inside the derivative is r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0.

Wait, but wait a minute. This would mean that the divergence is zero except at the origin. So the volume integral over any region that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the sphere includes the origin, perhaps it's zero except at a point. But how does that affect the integral?

Wait, but wait another thing. Because if the field is 1/r
