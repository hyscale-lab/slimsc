Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, but wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift, right?

The question asks about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. They assume both stars radiate as black bodies.

So, first, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but wait—does the Doppler shift affect this? Because Star_2 is moving away (since radial velocity is positive 700 km/s) or towards? Oh, radial velocity is 700 km/s for Star_2, but Star_1's is zero. So Star_2 is moving relative to us, which would cause a redshift or blueshift.

Wait, no. The problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both. But their actual emission peaks might be different before considering any Doppler shifts.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think. If a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity is towards or away?), wait, usually, positive radial velocity is moving away. Because when a star moves away, the light is redshifted, so the wavelength increases. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s
