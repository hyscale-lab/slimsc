Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring a particular value for an observable. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait—wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors usually are normalized, but these numbers don't look normalized. Let me check: the square of each component's magnitude should add up to 1 if it's normalized. Let's compute that. The state is (-1, 2, 1). So the squares are (-1)^2 =1, 2^2=4, 1^2=1. Adding them up, 1+4+1=6. So the state vector has a magnitude squared of 6. That means it's not normalized. So when we calculate probabilities, I'll have to remember to normalize the state first, right? Or is the given state already normalized? Wait, no, because 6 isn't 1. So I think the state should be divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector.

But wait, the problem says it's the state vector. Maybe the given vector isn't normalized, and I need to handle that. Let me make a note: I'll have to normalize the state vector before proceeding.

So the first step is to normalize the state vector. The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm is sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me write that as |ψ> = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

The observable is represented by the matrix P, which is given as:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, so P is a 3x3 matrix. I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, for an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones correspond to 0.

Wait, but let me think. The operator P is given, and I need to find the probability of measuring 0. So I have to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then project the state |ψ> onto that eigenvector. The square of the norm of that projection will give the probability.

Alternatively, if P is a projection operator (if it is idempotent, i.e., P² = P), then the eigenvalues are 0 and 1. But I'm not sure if P is a projection operator. Let me check: compute P squared and see if it equals P.

Wait, perhaps P is a projection operator. Let me think about that. The matrix P:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm. Let's compute P squared:

Each element (i,j) of P squared is the dot product of row i of P and column j of P.

So let's compute each element:

Element (1,1): (0)(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + (0)(0) = (1/2)

Element (1,2): (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (0)(1/sqrt(2)) = 0

Element (1,3): (0)(0) + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 = 1/2

Similarly, row 2:

Element (2,1): (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) = 0

Element (2,2): (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) = (1/2 + 1/2) = 1

Element (2,3): (1/sqrt(2))(0) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) = 0

Row 3:

Element (3,1): 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 = 1/2

Element (3,2): 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) = 0

Element (3,3): 0*0 + (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 = 1/2

So P squared is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Comparing to P:

P is:

[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

So P squared is not equal to P, because for example, the (1,1) element is 1/2 vs 0 in P. So P is not a projection operator. That complicates things.

Hence, the eigenvalues of P will determine the possible outcomes. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Let's set up the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

[ 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (0)(1/sqrt(2)) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps expanding the determinant along the first row.

det = (-λ) * det [ (-λ, 1/sqrt(2)), (1/sqrt(2), -λ) ] 
          - (1/sqrt(2)) * det [ (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), (0, -λ) ]
          + 0 * ... 

Let's compute each minor.

First minor: the 2x2 determinant from rows 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3.

det [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ) ]
