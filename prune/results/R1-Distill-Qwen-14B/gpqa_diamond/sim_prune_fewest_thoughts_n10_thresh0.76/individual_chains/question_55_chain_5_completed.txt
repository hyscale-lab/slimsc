Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, and they're either cis or trans. 

Let me start by recalling what these structures look like. Acetate esters have the structure OAc-O-R, right? So, the R group here is either propenyl or butenyl, and whether it's cis or trans depends on the configuration of the double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: the peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets?), 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet), and 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet).

Wait, the singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably the acetate's methyl group. Since it's a singlet, that makes sense because there's no neighboring hydrogens.

The 1.6 ppm doublet indicates a CH2 group adjacent to something. But wait, propenyl has CH2 groups. Or wait, but if it's a propenyl group, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or butenyl would be longer.

Wait, but let me think about the protons on the double bond. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling constant of 16 Hz. That's a large coupling, so it's probably a trans coupling between two vinylic (double bond) protons.

In the case of an allyl ester, the protons on the double bond typically show up around 5-6 ppm. Wait, but here we have a peak at 7.0 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's a substituted double bond, like if there's an electron-withdrawing group nearby, which could deshield the protons and shift them upfield. No, wait, deshielding would cause downfield shifts. Wait, acetate is an ester, which is an EWG, so maybe the protons are deshielded.

Wait, but let me think about the structures:

Option C) Cis-propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc with the substituents on the same side. 

Option B) Trans-propenyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2-OAc with substituents opposite.

Similarly, options A and D are butenyl, so longer chains.

Wait, but the NMR shows two sets of peaks for the vinylic protons. Let me check.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet for 1H, and 5.5 is a doublet of something. Hmm, maybe the 5.5 is a triplet or a multiplet.

Wait, the NMR shows 7.0 (d, J=16), 5.5 (dq), 2.1 (s), 1.6 (d). So, two different sets of vinylic protons.

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted double bond. Let me think. For a propenyl group:

In the trans case, the two vinylic protons would be on opposite sides. The coupling between them would be trans, so J would be around 16 Hz. That would explain the 7.0 ppm peak as one of the vinylic protons, and another nearby.

Wait, but if it's a propenyl group, then the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, the vinylic protons are the two on the double bond. So, in the trans case, the two CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond would have different environments. Wait, but propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So, the middle CH might have two H's, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me imagine the structure. For cis and trans propenyl acetate:

In cis-propenyl acetate, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side. For trans, they're opposite.

So, the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, maybe the protons on the double bond are one on each carbon. Like, for trans-propenyl acetate: the two CH2 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but the NMR has two different sets of vinylic protons. So, perhaps one is a doublet and the other is a more complex splitting.

Wait, another approach: the coupling of 16 Hz is quite large, which is typical for trans coupling between vinylic protons. So, that suggests that the two protons are trans to each other.

So, the 7.0 ppm peak is a vinylic proton that's coupled to another with J=16 Hz. Then, the 5.5 peak is another vinylic proton, possibly coupled to others.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structures.

Let's consider the four options:

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

Wait, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are OAc on C3. So in the cis case, the OAc and the CH2 would be on the same side of the double bond.

The vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. So, for the double bond CH2=CH, each CH has two protons. Wait, no, wait: if it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the double bond is between C1 and C2: C1 has two H's (CH2), C2 has one H (if it's CH2=CH-...), wait, no, wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think of propenyl as CH2=CHCH2-.

So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, C1 is CH2, and C2 is CH.

So, the vinylic protons would be on C2, which is a CH with one H. So, each of the double bond carbons would have 2 H's? No, no, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the actual structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's butyl. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So, it's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between the first and second CH2? No, that can't be right because that would be 1-propenyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a J of 16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests it's a trans coupling between two protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond. So, for a vinyl group, like CH2=CH-, the two protons on each CH would couple with each other. But in a trans arrangement.

Wait, but in a propenyl group, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, the CH2 group is attached to the oxygen. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 and C2 would be CH2-OAc and CH2 groups, respectively.

Wait, maybe I should consider the coupling of the vinylic protons. The 7.0 ppm proton is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which suggests it's coupled to another proton. The 5.5 ppm proton is a doublet of quadruplet or something, which might be coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is a vinylic proton that's trans to another. So, in the trans-propenyl structure, the two vinylic protons would be on opposite sides, so each would couple to each other with a large J.

Wait, but in propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, the CH2 group is attached to the ester. The vinylic protons are the two on the double bond, which is CH2=CH-.

Wait, perhaps the protons on the CH2= group are each split into doublets because they couple with each other. So, each would be a doublet. But in the NMR data, we have two different peaks: one at 7.0 (d, J=16) and another at 5.5 (dq).

Wait, maybe the 7.0 peak is one of the vinylic protons, and the 5.5 is another. But why would they be at such different ppm?

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 peak is the coupling with more than one proton. Maybe it's a doublet of quartets? Or perhaps it's a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons.

Wait, another thing: the 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H. So that's probably a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2. For example, in a structure like CH2CH2CH3, but that's not relevant here. Wait, in propenyl, perhaps the CH2-OAc is next to the double bond. So, the CH2 group attached to the double bond would have protons. But in the NMR, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, so maybe that's a CH2 group next to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The CH2-OAc group is adjacent to the CH2 of the double bond.

Wait, let me think about the coupling. The 7.0 ppm proton is a doublet, which suggests it's coupled to one neighboring proton. The J=16 Hz is indicative of a trans coupling across a double bond.

So, in the structure, the proton at 7.0 is on one carbon of the double bond, and the other proton on the adjacent carbon is on the other side, causing the large J.

So, perhaps the structure is such that the two vinylic protons are trans, which would be the case in trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but in trans-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons would be on opposite sides, so they would couple with each other, leading to each being a doublet. So, each would have a doublet with J=16 Hz.

But the NMR shows two different peaks, one at 7.0 and another at 5.5. So why the difference in chemical shifts?

Hmm, maybe one of the vinylic protons is next to an electronegative group, like the ester oxygen, which would deshield it, causing a downfield shift. So, the proton closer to the ester would be at higher ppm.

In CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2-OAc is adjacent to the double bond. So the CH2= would be closer to the ester. So the vinylic protons on the CH2 would be more deshielded and appear upfield or downfield?

Wait, deshielded means downfield, higher ppm. So the protons on the CH2 closer to the ester would be at higher ppm, like 7.0, while the other vinylic proton (on the CH) would be less deshielded, around 5.5.

Wait, but the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that would be a trans configuration. Or is it OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's butyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the integration. The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, and the 5.5 is 1H. So, each vinylic proton is split into different patterns.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 peak is a doublet of quadruplets or something because it's coupling with more than one proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a triplet due to coupling with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, another approach: the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 group adjacent to a CH. So perhaps it's a CH2-CH3 group, but in the context of a double bond. So, maybe in a structure like CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, the CH2-OAc is attached to the CH2 group, which is next to the double bond.

In this case, the CH2=CH- group would have two vinylic protons. The CH2 group next to the double bond (CH2-) would have a CH2 group, which has 2 H's.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H, which suggests a CH3 group adjacent to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where the CH2 is next to the CH2-OAc.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the 1.6 ppm is a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the double bond.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)-OAc. No, that would make it a longer chain. Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2 next to the double bond. So, for example, if the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl, not propenyl.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the options.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl is four carbons, so this would be a butenyl group)

B) Trans-propenyl acetate: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (but propenyl is three carbons)

Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so for propenyl acetate, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? Or OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituents wrong. Let me clarify.

Propenyl group: -CH2-CH=CH2. So, propenyl acetate would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this structure, the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if the chain is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2). So, the vinylic protons are on C2 and C3.

Wait, but in propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but that would make the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the vinylic protons are on C2 and C3.

In the trans case, the substituents on C2 and C3 would be on opposite sides. So, the CH2-OAc group is on one side, and the CH3 (if any?) on the other. Wait, no, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. So, the substituents are OAc-O-CH2- on C2 and CH2 on C3.

Wait, but in that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the substituents on each end would be CH2-OAc and CH2 (from C3).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling between the two vinylic protons. In a trans configuration, their coupling constant J would be around 16 Hz.

So, for trans-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons (on C2 and C3) would be trans to each other, leading to a J of about 16 Hz.

So, each of these protons would appear as a doublet.

But in the NMR, we have two different peaks: 7.0 (d, J=16) and 5.5 (dq).

Hmm, so why are they at different ppm?

Because one of the vinylic protons is adjacent to the ester group, which deshields it, causing a higher ppm shift. The other is further away, so it's at a lower ppm.

So, the proton closer to the ester (on C2) would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm (7.0), and the one on C3 (CH2 group) would be less deshielded, appearing at around 5.5 ppm.

Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplet or something, perhaps due to coupling with more than one proton.

Wait, another thought. The 5.5 peak is a doublet of quadruplets, perhaps because it's coupled to two sets of protons. Like, it's coupled to the J=16 Hz from the trans proton and also to some other protons, maybe the adjacent CH2.

Wait, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (trans). So, the vinylic protons are on CH=.

The CH2-OAc is attached to the C2, and the CH2 is attached to C3.

The vinylic proton on C2 (CH2-OAc) would have a larger deshield, so higher ppm (around 7.0). The vinylic proton on C3 would be less deshielded, around 5.5.

Now, the 5.5 peak is a doublet of quartets, meaning it's coupled to two different sets of protons. Or perhaps it's a triplet, but the description says dq, which might be a doublet of quadruplets.

Wait, but perhaps the 5.5 proton is the one on C3. It's coupled to the trans proton (J=16), and also to any adjacent protons. Since C3 is CH2, perhaps the H on C3 is also coupled to the two H's on the adjacent CH2 group.

So, the 5.5 peak is a doublet from the trans coupling and a triplet from coupling with the adjacent CH2. But wait, the integration is 1H, so it's a single proton.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like OAc-O-CH2-C(R)=CH2. No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the 5.5 peak is a result of coupling with both the trans proton and the adjacent CH2 group. So, the proton on C3 is coupled to the trans proton (J=16) and to the two protons on the adjacent CH2 (J= something else).

So, in that case, it would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets, which would look like a dq in the data.

So, for the trans-propenyl acetate, the two vinylic protons would be at 7.0 and 5.5, each as a doublet and a more complex splitting.

Now, looking at the other peaks. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, 3H. That's likely a CH3 group attached to a CH2. So, in the structure, perhaps the CH2-OAc is next to a CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2. There's no CH3 group in that.

Wait, then why is there a 1.6 ppm peak with 3H? Unless it's a butenyl group.

Ah, because the options include butenyl as well. So, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group, which would have more carbons.

Wait, let's think about butenyl acetate. The structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Or OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH2?

Wait, but then the 1.6 ppm could be a CH3 group attached to the end. Wait, but butenyl acetate would have four carbons in the R group.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. So, the double bond is between C3 and C4. Then, the CH2 groups are on C1 and C2.

In that case, the vinylic protons would be on C3 and C4. The protons on C4 would be a CH2 group, but perhaps in the case of cis or trans.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a doublet (J=16) and a doublet of quadruplets, so perhaps in the structure, the CH2 groups are adjacent to the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to the double bond. So, like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc, but that would be trans if the substituents are on opposite sides.

But then the vinylic protons would be on CH2= and CH. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, so it's butenyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me try to match the NMR data with each option.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2 (trans). So, the double bond is between C2 and C3.

The vinylic protons are on C2 and C3.

The C2 has CH2-OAc and the double bond. So, the H on C2 (if any) would be part of the double bond. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? No, wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, that would have the double bond between C2 and C3 (counting from the OAc). So, the substituents on C2 and C3 would be CH2-OAc and CH2, respectively.

In the trans configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. So, the CH2-OAc and CH2 groups are on opposite sides.

The vinylic protons on C2 and C3 would couple with each other. Each would be a doublet with J=16 Hz.

So, the C2 proton would be more deshielded due to proximity to the ester, so higher ppm (around 7.0).

The C3 proton would be less deshielded, at around 5.5 ppm.

The C3's proton would also be coupled to the adjacent CH2 group (on C4), which is CH2-OAc. Wait, no, C4 is the OAc group. So, perhaps the C3 has a CH2 group attached, which has two H's.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm peak is 3H, which suggests a CH3 group. So, perhaps the structure isn't propenyl but butenyl.

If the structure is butenyl acetate, the R group is four carbons. So, for example, OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (trans).

In that case, the vinylic protons are on C3 and C4.

The proton on C4 would be a CH2 group, but that's not correct. Wait, but the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. The double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, the vinylic protons are on C3 and C4. The C3 would have a CH2 group, and C4 would have a CH2 group as well, but wait, that can't be right because a double bond can't be between two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the group attached to C2 is CH2CH2-OAc.

Wait, but then the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (but that's pentenyl, which isn't an option).

Wait, another approach: the 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet of 3H. So, that's a CH3 group adjacent to a CH. So, perhaps the structure has a CH3-CH2- group.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So, in this case, the vinylic protons are on the CH2=CH group.

So, the proton on CH2 would be more deshielded (7.0 ppm), and the CH would be less deshielded (5.5 ppm). 

Wait, but in this structure, the CH2 would have two H's, but the NMR shows only 1H each. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc. No, that's more complex.

Wait, I think I need to consider the integration. The 7.0 ppm is 1H, 5.5 is 1H, 2.1 is 3H, and 1.6 is 3H. So, the molecule has a total of 8 H's.

Wait, the acetate group has 3 H's (OAc). The other groups: the 1.6 is a CH3, 2.1 is OAc's CH3, and the two vinylic H's, plus any others.

Wait, but in propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, that's 2 H's on CH2=, 2 H's on CH2 (next to OAc), and the OAc's 3 H's. So, total of 2+2+3 =7 H's. But the NMR shows 8 H's (sum of 1+1+3+3=8). So, perhaps it's butenyl.

Ah, but wait, let me recount. For propenyl, CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have:

- CH2= (2 H's)

- CH2-OAc (2 H's)

OAc (3 H's)

Total 2+2+3=7. But the NMR data has 8 H's. So, perhaps butenyl, which would have more H's.

For butenyl, say OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. That's:

CH2-O- (2 H's)

CH2- (2 H's)

CH= (1 H on each of two CH's?)

Wait, but that might complicate. Alternatively, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc. So, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc.

In that case:

CH2= (2 H's)

CH- (1 H)

CH2- (2 H's)

CH2-OAc (2 H's)

OAc (3 H's)

Total: 2+1+2+2+3=10 H's. But the NMR shows 8. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe the structure is different. Let me think: the 1.6 ppm is a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-OAc. That would add a CH2CH3 group, but it's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 is a CH3 group attached to a CH, which is attached to the double bond. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc. That's a propenyl group with a branching, making it isopropenyl. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I should look back at the options and see which structures fit the data.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So, the options are between propenyl (3 carbons) and butenyl (4 carbons).

The NMR data has 8 H's. Let's count for each option.

For propenyl acetate (C3H5O2Ac), the formula would be C4H7O2. So, 4 carbons: OAc (2 carbons) + propenyl (3 carbons). But acetate is OAc- (ester), so the formula is C4H7O2.

Hydrogens: OAc has 3 H, propenyl has 5 H. So total 8 H. That matches the NMR's 8 H. So, it must be a propenyl compound.

Wait, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

So, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, but that's four carbons (OAc is two, CH2-CH=CH2 is three), but wait OAc is part of the ester.

Wait, the correct formula would be C4H7O2. The NMR shows 8 H's, so that fits.

So, the structure is propenyl acetate, either cis or trans.

Now, the NMR shows two vinylic protons: one at 7.0 (d, J=16) and another at 5.5 (dq).

In the trans case, the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides, so each would be a doublet with J=16. The one closer to the ester would be more deshielded, so higher ppm (7.0), and the other further away would be at 5.5.

In the cis case, the two vinylic protons are on the same side. But would their coupling be the same?

Wait, in the cis case, the coupling J would still be around 16 Hz because it's trans coupling. Wait, no, the coupling is between adjacent protons on the double bond, which is trans regardless of the configuration.

Wait, no, the configuration refers to the substituents on the double bond, not the coupling. The coupling J is determined by the geometry. Trans double bonds have larger J (16 Hz), cis have smaller J (around 10 Hz?).

Wait, no, actually, for ethylene groups, the trans coupling J is around 16 Hz, and cis is around 10-12 Hz. So, the 16 Hz in the NMR suggests a trans configuration.

So, if the J is 16, it's a trans coupling, so the compound is either B or D (trans-propenyl or trans-butenyl).

But earlier, we concluded that the correct structure is propenyl, as the H count matches.

So, option B is trans-propenyl acetate.

But wait, the integration of the NMR data: 7.0 (1H), 5.5 (1H), 2.1 (3H), 1.6 (3H).

In trans-propenyl acetate, the vinylic protons would each be 1H, as in the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2= has two H's, but maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify the structure.

Propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-.

So, the structure of trans-propenyl acetate is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the substituents are CH2-OAc on C2 and CH2 on C3.

In the trans configuration, the substituents (CH2-OAc and CH2) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, the vinylic protons are on C2 and C3.

Wait, but C2 is CH2-OAc and double bonded to C3. So, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would imply a CH2 group attached to the double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that's butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, making it propenyl.

In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The substituents are CH2-OAc on C2 and CH2 on C3.

In the trans configuration, the two substituents (CH2-OAc and CH2) are on opposite sides.

So, the vinylic protons (on C2 and C3) would each be a doublet with J=16 Hz.

The C2 proton is next to the OAc group, so more deshielded, higher ppm (7.0).

The C3 proton is less deshielded, so around 5.5.

The 5.5 peak is a doublet of quadruplets perhaps because it's coupled to the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but the CH2 group on C3 would have two H's, so the C3 proton (which is a CH) would be coupled to these two H's, leading to a triplet. But the data says it's a dq, which is a doublet of quadruplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3 proton is coupled to the adjacent CH2 (two H's) and the trans proton (J=16), leading to a triplet of doublets, which might appear as a dq.

In any case, the J=16 Hz suggests a trans configuration, so the compound is either B or D.

But the H count for propenyl is 8, which matches the NMR data. So, the structure is propenyl acetate, trans.

So, the correct answer is option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its ¹H NMR data. The options are four types of acetates: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **The singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate group (OAc), which is consistent with ester functionality.

2. **The doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** indicates a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). This large coupling is characteristic of a **trans configuration** between adjacent vinylic protons.

3. **The doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm (1H)** suggests a vinylic proton coupled to both the trans vinylic proton (J = 16 Hz) and adjacent protons, likely from a CH₂ group.

4. **The doublet at 1.6 ppm (3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a CH group, likely part of a CH₂-CH₃ structure near the double bond.

5. **Total integration of 8H** matches the molecular formula of propenyl acetate (C₄H₈O₂), ruling out butenyl acetate (C₅H₁₀O₂), which would have more hydrogens.

### Structural Considerations:
- **Propenyl acetate** has the structure **CH₃COO-CH₂-CH=CH₂**. The double bond is between C2 and C3, with the acetate group on C1.
- In the **trans configuration**, the substituents on C2 and C3 (CH₂-OAc and CH₂) are on opposite sides of the double bond. This results in the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) between the vinylic protons.
- The proton on C2 (closer to the acetate group) is more deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the acetate, appearing at **7.0 ppm**. The proton on C3 (further from the acetate group) is less deshielded, appearing at **5.5 ppm**.

### Elimination of Options:
- **Cis-butenyl acetate (A)** and **Trans-butenyl acetate (D)** are ruled out because they have a butenyl group (four carbons), which would result in more hydrogens than the NMR data indicates.
- **Cis-propenyl acetate (C)** is ruled out because the coupling constant (J = 16 Hz) is too large for a cis configuration, which typically has a smaller J (~10 Hz).
- **Trans-propenyl acetate (B)** matches the NMR data, including the large J = 16 Hz for the vinylic protons, the chemical shifts, and the total integration.

### Conclusion:
The unknown compound is **Trans-propenyl acetate**.  
**Answer: B**
