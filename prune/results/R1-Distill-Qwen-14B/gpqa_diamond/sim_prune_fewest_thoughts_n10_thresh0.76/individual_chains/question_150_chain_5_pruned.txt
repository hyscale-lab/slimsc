Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me read through it carefully.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate its degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings, double bonds, or triple bonds. Five is a lot, so maybe it's a benzene ring (which accounts for 3) plus a couple more, like a double bond and an ether or something.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at the peaks. 

1H-NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H)
- 6.98 (d, 2H)
- 6.51 (d, 2H)
- 6.27 (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's probably a proton that's deshielded, maybe an aldehyde or a ketone. But wait, in an aldehyde, the proton is usually around 9-10 ppm, as a singlet. But here it's a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton, like an aromatic ring with substituents?

Wait, but there's also a doublet at 6.98 and 6.51, each 2H. Oh, that looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons, maybe on adjacent carbons in a ring. So, perhaps two aromatic rings? Because each has 2H as a doublet. Or maybe one ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe a substituent with two sets of doublets, like a di-substituted benzene, but para?

Wait, the 6.27 (bs, 2H) is broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe exchange or something like hydroxyl protons, but in aromatic regions. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton, but the broadness is confusing. Or maybe it's an -OCH2 group, but the integration is 2H, so maybe CH2.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That could be an OCH2 group, because oxygen is electronegative and would deshield the protons, making them appear around 3-4 ppm. A doublet suggests they're coupled to something else, maybe another set of two protons, so perhaps adjacent to a CH2 group.

Wait, putting this together. Maybe the structure has two benzene rings attached to a central chain. The
