Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. I remember TTV stands for transit timing variations, which is a method to detect planets by looking at how their transits (when they pass in front of the star) are timed. But maybe the method isn't too important here; the key is the orbital periods and equilibrium temperatures.

The system has five planets, Planet_1 to Planet_5. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so that's the ratio between their periods? So Planet_1 has period P, Planet_2 has 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. Got it.

The question is asking about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Oh, right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( ( Lstar / (16πσ) )^(1/4) ) * ( (1 - a) / (distance)^2 )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law.

Wait, the formula I think is T = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) ), where a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. But maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( (1 AU) / a )^(1/2) ), assuming the star's luminosity is similar to the Sun. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula, but I think the key is that the temperature depends on the distance from the star and the albedo. Since albedo is the same for both planets here, that part cancels out.

So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Wait, why? Because the period is related to the semi-major axis
