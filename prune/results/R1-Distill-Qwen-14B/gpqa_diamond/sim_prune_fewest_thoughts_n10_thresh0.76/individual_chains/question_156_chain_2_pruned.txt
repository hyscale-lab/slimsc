Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question is about two reactions performed by a chemist. Both reactions involve treating different ene structures with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. I need to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I need to recall what mCPBA does. From what I remember, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, and it's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with a peracid to form an epoxide. So, both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 are epoxidation reactions.

Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene. E geometry means the higher priority groups on each carbon of the double bond are on opposite sides. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene, which means the higher priority groups are on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The regiochemistry of the epoxide depends on the structure of the alkene and the reaction conditions. But since both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, they should form the corresponding epoxides.

Wait, but after the epoxidation, the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh right, acid catalyzed ring opening of epoxides. So the epoxide will undergo acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The epoxide ring opens under acidic conditions, typically leading to the formation of diols.

Wait, but what's the structure of the starting alkenes and how the epoxidation proceeds? Let me think. For both E and Z alkenes, when they react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, no. When a peracid reacts with an alkene, the epoxidation occurs with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. That is, the peracid adds across the double bond in a concerted manner, so the configuration of the double bond (E or Z) will determine the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, but
