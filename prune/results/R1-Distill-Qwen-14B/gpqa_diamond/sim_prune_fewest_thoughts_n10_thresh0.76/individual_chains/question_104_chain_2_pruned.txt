Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits it, and this movement causes shifts in the spectral lines.

So, the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as each other and similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the orbital periods, specifically Period2 / Period1.

Wait, but how do the spectral line shifts relate to the orbital period? I think the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is the maximum velocity it moves toward or away from us. The semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters.

From what I recall, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1/(1 - e²)) )^(1/2) ) / ( ( (P * (1 day)) )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Let me think again. I think the formula for K is more about the velocity. Let me try to write it down.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (2π / P )^(1/3) ) ) / c

Wait, maybe I should get the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the star's mass.

Wait, another approach: the RV method measures the star's velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is:

K = (v) where v = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (2π)/(P) )^(1/3) ) / c

But wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify it because the eccentricity e is probably not given, and the planets are in circular orbits, so e=0. So the (1 - e^2)^(1/2) term becomes 1, which simplifies things.

So for circular orbits, K simpl
