Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a long one. I guess I should start by figuring out how many carbon and hydrogen atoms are in this molecule. Oh wait, enthalpy of formation is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I need to calculate the energy change when this compound forms from carbon and hydrogen.

The given data includes enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Atomization is the energy needed to break a bond to make an atom. So, for each C-C bond, it's 200 kJ/mol, meaning each bond requires 200 kJ to break. Similarly, C=O is 300, and C-H is 400.

Wait, but the question is about enthalpy of formation, which is usually calculated using bond energies. Oh right, the formula is: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products). But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, sometimes the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the bonds broken in the reactants and bonds formed in the products.

Wait, no, another approach. For the ent
