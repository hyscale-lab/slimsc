Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm. Let me try to think this through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to recall what I know.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are A to D.

Wait, so the setup is that the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving forward, and the light is moving with it. But the glass is a medium, so the speed of light within it will be slower than c, right?

I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. So in the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But wait, the glass itself is moving. So we need to consider a frame of reference here.

Wait, the observer is in the lab. The lab is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Or wait, wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Wait, the beam is propagating through the glass towards the observer. Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, which is towards the observer. Hmm, that's a
