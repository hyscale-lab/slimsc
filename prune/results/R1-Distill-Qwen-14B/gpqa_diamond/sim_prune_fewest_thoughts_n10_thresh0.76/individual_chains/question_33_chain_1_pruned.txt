Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, which I think is a Diels-Alder reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

Wait, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. The diene is usually conjugated, and the dienophile is something like a ketone or an electron-deficient molecule. So in this case, 2,5-dimethylthiophene has two methyl groups, which might make it a good diene? Or wait, wait. Thiophene is aromatic, so maybe it's acting as a dienophile? Or is it the furan-2,5-dione that is the dienophile?

Furan-2,5-dione, also known as dioxolane dione, is a good dienophile because it's electron-deficient. The two ketone groups (diones) make it a good electron acceptor. So the diene must be the 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene itself is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. But wait, for Diels-Alder, the diene needs to be conjugated. Thiophene has a conjugated system, so maybe it can act as the diene.
