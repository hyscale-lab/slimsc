Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem states: We have 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is calculated using Coulomb's Law formula. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Since all the charges are identical, each is 2e. So each charge is 2 times the elementary charge. Let me confirm: the elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge here is 2e = 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the setup: 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is stationary, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from it.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy configuration. Oh, right! For a system of charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. To minimize the energy, considering that like charges repel, the minimal potential energy would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, so their positions relative to P are fixed. So the potential energy here is due to each of the 12 charges interacting with the charge at P.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the potential energy for each of these interactions would be k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m), right? Because each is at distance 2 m from P.

Wait,
