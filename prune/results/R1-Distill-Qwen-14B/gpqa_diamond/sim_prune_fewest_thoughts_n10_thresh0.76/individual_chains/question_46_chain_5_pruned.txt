Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs typically does ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. Since the starting material is a mono-olefin (only one double bond), I think it's about ring-closing, but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is a straight-chain molecule. Let me draw its structure. 

3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons with a double bond at position 1. So, structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)? No wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So, 1 is the first carbon, double bond between C1 and C2. Then C3 is the next. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because that's five carbons in total. Or wait, wait, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3). Wait, but that would be four carbons, right? Wait, no. Let me count again. For pent-1-ene, the main chain is five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that's six. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's figure it out properly.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the parent chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1
