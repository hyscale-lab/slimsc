Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but I'll try to remember the basics.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I'm trying to visualize what kind of space this represents. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. In two dimensions, that's the hyperbolic plane, right? But pseudospheres are usually considered in higher dimensions, but maybe this is a 2D case.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y, so it's a 2D metric. So the space here is two-dimensional. The form of the metric looks like it's conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of (dx² + dy²). So I can write it as ds² = E (dx² + dy²), where E is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

To find the area, I should probably compute the area element. In a 2D metric, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, since it's conformally flat, the metric tensor is diagonal, with E at each component. So the determinant would be E * E - 0, since it's diagonal. Wait, no, wait. The metric tensor g in 2D is:

[ E, 0 ]
[ 0, E ]

So the determinant is E * E - 0 = E². So the area element is sqrt(E²) dx dy, which is E dx dy, because E is positive (since denominator 4 - x² - y² must be positive, otherwise the metric would be undefined or have imaginary terms). So E is positive when x² + y² <4.

So the area would be the integral of E dx dy over the region where x² + y² <4. Wait, but wait a second. E is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of (32)/(4 - r²) dA, where r² = x² +
