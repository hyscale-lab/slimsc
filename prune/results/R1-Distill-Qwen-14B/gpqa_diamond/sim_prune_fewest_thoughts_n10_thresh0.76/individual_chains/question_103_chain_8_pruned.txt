Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The question is asking for the sequence of reactions that would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions labeled i to vii.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that's a benzene ring with substituents. The ethan-1-one part means there's a ketone group (C=O) attached to a methyl group, right? Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- as a substituent on the benzene ring. So the substituents on the benzene are a ketone (maybe at the 1-position?), a bromo group at 3, and a nitro group at 5. Let me visualize the benzene ring. Positions 1, 3, and 5 would be meta to each other, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. So the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is such that the ketone is at position 1, and substituents are at 3 and 5.

Wait, let me think. The substituents are 3-bromo and 5-nitro on the phenyl group attached to the ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is at position 1, as the substituent. So the benzene ring has the ketone (as a substituent) at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. So, the positions are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2).

But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1, 3, 5 are all adjacent in a way that each is separated by two carbons. So in the ring, the ketone is at position
