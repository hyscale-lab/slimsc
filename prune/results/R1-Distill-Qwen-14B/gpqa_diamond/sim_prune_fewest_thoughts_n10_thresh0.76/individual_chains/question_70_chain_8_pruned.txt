Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions and gives some products and their properties. My goal is to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are different symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Alright, let's break down the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. I need to figure out what these substances are based on the reactions and the properties given.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8B → C. The bright red product C. Bright red makes me think of something like a metal oxide or maybe a transition metal compound. Also, 8 equivalents of gas B. Let me think about common gases. Gas B could be something like oxygen (O2), which is a diatomic molecule.

If A is a metal, say copper, and B is oxygen, then reacting in a 8:1 ratio. Let's see: copper (A) reacting with oxygen (B) in a high ratio. For example, copper can form CuO when reacted with O2, but that's a 2:1 ratio. Wait, but the reaction here uses 8 equivalents of B. Wait, maybe A is a metal with a higher valency. Alternatively, perhaps not a metal.

Wait, another approach: when a metal reacts with oxygen, the product is a metal oxide. The stoichiometry depends on the metal and the oxidation state. Let's say A is Fe (iron). Iron can form FeO (1:1), Fe3O4 (3:4, but that's more like 3 Fe to 4 O?), or FeO·nH2O. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a non-metal. But bright red makes me think of something like CuO? No, CuO is black. Hmm.

Wait, wait. What about sulfur? Sulfur (S8, which is a solid) reacts with O2 to form SO3? Or maybe SO2? Wait, but SO3 would require more O. Alternatively, maybe the product is something else.

Another thought: the bright red color. Could it be a nitrate? I'm not sure. Let's think of another reaction. What if A is a metal and B is oxygen. Let's say A is Fe, and when it reacts with O2, it forms Fe3O4. The formula for Fe3O4 is FeO·Fe2O3, which is equivalent to Fe3O4. The reaction would be 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. But I'm not sure about the equivalents. In the problem, 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used. So for 4 moles of Fe, 3 moles of O2 are needed. So the ratio is 4 Fe : 3 O2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B. So maybe 8 O2 for 1 Fe? That would be a 1:8 ratio, which is not the usual.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and another gas. Wait, if B is a gas, maybe it's something else besides O2. Like Cl2? No, Cl2 is a diatomic gas, but reacting with a solid.

Wait, reaction 4 says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents are often polar molecules, like H2O, HCl (but that's a gas), maybe something like DMSO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, H could be something like HCl, but that's a gas. Wait, maybe H is H
