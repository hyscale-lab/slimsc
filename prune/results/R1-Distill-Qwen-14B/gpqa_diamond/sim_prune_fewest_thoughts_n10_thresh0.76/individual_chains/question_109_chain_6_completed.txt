Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and some quantum numbers. Hmm, let's break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. Oh right, Pauli statistics come into play here. Pauli's exclusion principle says that for identical fermions, their total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric under exchange. But wait, in this case, it's about the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So this equation relates these quantum numbers. And the final state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find which partial wave isn't allowed based on the conservation laws.

First, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 would have 2S+1 =1, which means S=0. L is S in spectroscopic notation, right? No, wait, in the term symbol, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So L here is S? Wait, no, the term is written as 1S0. So the first number is 2S+1. So 1 = 2S+1 → S=0. Then the next part is the orbital angular momentum L, which is S here? Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L J. Oh wait, no, the L comes next. So 1S0 would have (2S+1)=1 → S=0. Then L is denoted by the letter S. Wait, no, S is for spin. The orbital angular momentum is denoted by letters: S, P, D, F, etc., which correspond to L=0,1,2,3,...

So in 1S0, the orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since S stands for L=0). And the spin state is S=0. So the total spin and orbital part are both zero. Then the J comes from the combination of spin and orbital, but for a singlet state, spin is zero, so J would be 0 as well.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So S=0, L=0, J=0. Because J is the total angular momentum, which is the vector sum of spin and orbital. So if both are zero, J is zero.

Now, the particle X emitted has intrinsic parity -1. So when a particle is emitted, the parity of the process will affect the overall parity conservation.

Wait, but parity isn't conserved in weak interactions, but here I think it's assuming strong or electromagnetic, where parity is conserved. Or maybe the problem is just about angular momentum and parity in general.

The problem states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So T is the isospin of the final NN state. So T_final = S_final + L_final + 1 mod 2.

The final NN state has T=0. So substituting:

0 ≡ S_final + L_final + 1 mod 2.

So rearranging: S_final + L_final ≡ -1 ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S_final + L_final must be odd.

Hmm. So for the final state of the two nucleons, their spin and orbital angular momentum must add up to an odd number (mod 2). So either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even, but since S is the total spin (can be 0,1,2...), but for two nucleons, spin can be 0 or 1. Wait, because each nucleon is spin-1/2, so their total spin can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So S_final can be 0 or 1.

Similarly, L_final can be 0,1,2,...

But let's think about the process. The initial state is 1S0, so J_initial is 0. After emitting particle X, the NN system is in some state with certain quantum numbers. Since angular momentum is conserved, the initial state's total angular momentum (J=0) must equal the sum of the angular momentum of the emitted particle and the final NN state.

So the initial system has J=0. After emission, the system is the NN in state (L_final, S_final) and the particle X with angular momentum l (lowercase, since it's the particle's angular momentum state). So the total angular momentum is the vector sum, but since J_initial is zero, the sum must also be zero. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the orbital angular momentum of the X emission is considered.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of parity and angular momentum conservation.

The parity of the initial state is the parity of the NN system. The parity of a system is given by (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, which is L=0 (because S here is orbital and L=0), so parity is (-1)^0 =1.

When the NN emits particle X, the parity of the process must be considered. The parity of the final state (NN system) multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle X must equal the initial parity multiplied by the parity change due to orbital angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps the formula for parity conservation is:

Parity_initial = Parity_final * Parity_emission.

But I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me recall. The parity of the final state (NN) and the emitted particle X would relate to the initial parity and the orbital angular momentum involved in the emission.

The orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X would contribute a factor of (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X. Because when a particle is emitted, the orbital part involves integrating the wavefunction with an angular momentum factor, leading to a parity factor of (-1)^l.

So the parity of the process is initial_parity = (parity_NN_final) * (parity_X) * (-1)^l.

Wait, the initial parity is 1, as the initial state is 1S0 (L=0). The final state's parity is parity_NN = (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is the orbital angular momentum of the NN in the final state. The parity of X is given as -1. So putting it all together:

1 = [ (-1)^{L_final} ] * [ (-1) ] * (-1)^l

Simplify:

1 = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1) * (-1)^l → 1 = (-1)^{L_final + 1 + l}

Which implies that L_final +1 + l must be even, because (-1)^(even) =1.

So L_final + l +1 must be even. Which means L_final + l is odd, because 1 is added to make it even. So L_final + l ≡ 1 mod 2.

So L_final and l must have opposite parity. One is even, the other is odd.

So that's one condition.

Another condition is from the Pauli statistics: T_final = 0, which requires S_final + L_final is odd (from earlier) → S_final + L_final ≡ 1 mod 2.

So now, for each option, we need to see which one doesn't satisfy either of these conditions.

The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p

B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p

C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f

D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, the notation is a bit confusing. For each option, the NN state after emission is given, and the emitted particle's state. For example, in option A, the NN state is 7D1, and the emitted particle is p (which is a proton, I think, but perhaps it's the angular momentum state? Wait, wait. Wait, the question says "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." Oh, wait, the options are written as 1S0 → something with a letter. So the emitted particle's angular momentum state is given by the lowercase letter. So p, s, f, etc., are the spectroscopic notations for the angular momentum quantum number l.

Wait, let me parse the options correctly. Each option is the initial state → final NN state + emitted particle's angular momentum state.

For example:

Option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p: the NN state after emission is 7D1, and the emitted particle has angular momentum state p. So p corresponds to l=1 (since P is l=1, but wait, wait. Wait, the letters in the options are lowercase: p, s, f. What do these correspond to?

Wait, in spectroscopic notation, the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are denoted by letters: S (l=0), P (l=1), D (l=2), F (l=3), etc. So lowercase letters would correspond to the same. So p is l=1, s is l=0, f is l=3.

So in option A, the emitted particle has l=1 (since it's p). In option B, the emitted is p (l=1). Option C: f → l=3. Option D: s → l=0.

So each option's emitted particle has l as follows:

A: l=1

B: l=1

C: l=3

D: l=0

Now, the NN state in each option is given with certain L and S.

Wait, the final NN state is given as, for example, 7D1: the term is (2S +1)L J. So 7D1 would have 2S+1=7, so S=3 (since 2*3+1=7). The L is D, which is l=2. And J=1.

Wait, but for the NN system, their total angular momentum J isn't necessarily the same as the orbital angular momentum L and spin S. But for the purpose of finding L_final and S_final, perhaps we can treat S as their spin and L as their orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but the total angular momentum J is the sum of L and S. But for each option, the final state is given as a term symbol, which includes L and S.

So for each option, the final NN state has L_final and S_final.

So for each option:

Option A: 7D1 → (2S+1)=7 → S=3 (since 2*3+1=7). L is D → L=2. So S=3, L=2.

Option B: 3S1 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S→ L=0.

Option C: 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D→ L=2.

Option D: 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P→ L=1.

So, let's list each option:

A) S=3, L=2, l=1

B) S=1, L=0, l=1

C) S=1, L=2, l=3

D) S=1, L=1, l=0

Now, we can apply the conditions.

First condition: L_final + l must be odd.

Condition 2: S_final + L_final must be odd.

So for each option, check both conditions.

Let's go through each option.

Option A:

S=3 (so even?), L=2 (even), l=1 (odd).

Condition 2: S + L = 3 + 2 =5 → odd → meets condition (since 5 mod 2 is 1). So that's good.

Condition 1: L + l = 2 +1=3 → odd → meets condition. So both conditions satisfied. So this is allowed.

Option B:

S=1 (odd), L=0 (even), l=1 (odd).

Condition 2: S + L = 1 +0=1 → odd → meets condition.

Condition 1: L + l =0 +1=1 → odd → meets condition. So allowed.

Option C:

S=1 (odd), L=2 (even), l=3 (odd).

Condition 2: 1 +2=3 → odd → good.

Condition 1: L + l =2 +3=5 → odd → good. So allowed.

Option D:

S=1 (odd), L=1 (odd), l=0 (even).

Condition 2: S + L =1+1=2 → even → which does not equal 1 mod 2. So condition 2 is not met. So this should not be allowed.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the condition was T_final = S + L +1 mod2. Oh, wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. And T is 0.

So T =0 → 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod2.

So for option D: S=1, L=1 → sum is 2 → 2 mod2=0 → which doesn't equal 1. So condition not met.

So option D is not permitted.

Alternatively, looking at the conditions for each option:

Option D:

L_final=1, l=0.

Condition 1: L + l → 1 +0=1 → odd → condition met.

Condition 2: S + L → 1 +1=2 → even → not condition met.

So the second condition isn't satisfied for option D, which violates the Pauli requirement. Hence, it's not allowed.

But wait, what about the parity condition? Let me go back.

Earlier, we had from parity: L_final + l must be odd. So for option D: L=1, l=0 → sum is 1, which is odd. So condition met.

But the spin condition is not met, so even though parity is conserved, the spin condition isn't. So the state is not allowed.

Wait, but why does the spin condition take precedence? Because the problem states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T has to match that. So if the spin and angular momentum don't satisfy that condition, it's disallowed.

So looking back, only option D doesn't satisfy the spin and angular momentum condition, so it's not allowed.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The NN system starts in the 1S0 state. This corresponds to:
   - Total spin \( S = 0 \) (since \( 2S+1 = 1 \)).
   - Orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \) (denoted by "S" in the term symbol).
   - Total angular momentum \( J = 0 \) (since \( J = \vec{L} + \vec{S} \)).

2. **Final State**: After emitting particle \( X \), the NN system transitions to a new state with:
   - Total spin \( S_{\text{final}} \),
   - Orbital angular momentum \( L_{\text{final}} \),
   - Total angular momentum \( J_{\text{final}} \).

3. **Pauli Statistics Condition**: The isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy:
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} \equiv S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Since \( T_{\text{final}} = 0 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]

4. **Parity Conservation**: The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = 1 \). After emission, the parity of the final state is determined by:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{final}}} \cdot (-1)^l \cdot (-1),
   \]
   where \( l \) is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the emitted particle \( X \). This implies:
   \[
   L_{\text{final}} + l \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]

     - **Conclusion**: Permitted.

   - **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \) corresponds to \( S_{\text{final}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L_{\text{final}} = 2 \) (denoted by "D").
     - Emitted particle: \( f \) corresponds to \( l = 3 \) (denoted by "F").

     - **Conclusion**: Permitted.

   - **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \) corresponds to \( S_{\text{final}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)) and \( L_{\text{final}} = 1 \) (denoted by "P").
     - Emitted particle: \( s \) corresponds to \( l = 0 \) (denoted by "S").
     - **Conditions**:
       - \( S_{\text{final}} + L_{\text{final}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \) (not satisfied).
       - \( L_{\text{final}} + l = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \) (satisfied).
     - **Conclusion**: Not permitted (fails the spin condition).

**Final Answer**: The partial wave that is not permitted is **Option D**.
