Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a chemistry lab scenario. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about analyzing a small peptidic compound using NMR and LC-MS. There's some anomalies in the spectra, so I need to figure out what's going on.

First, the 1H NMR spectrum. The peaks are mostly as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Wait, but the integral is 1H together, so each is about 0.5H? Hmm, but why two peaks? They ruled out spin-spin coupling, so it's not splitting due to neighboring protons. So what else could cause two separate peaks for the same proton?

Then the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity at elevated temperature. Both have the same mass. So same molecular weight, but two different things eluting. Since the mass is same, it's not a fragment or a different molecule with same mass. So maybe it's two different forms of the same compound.

Thinking about possible reasons. The options are:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be higher, right? Because a precursor would have the same molecular formula as the product plus something else, like maybe a protecting group or another part. But the MS shows same mass, so that's probably not it.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images. In NMR, if the compound isn't chiral and has a plane of symmetry, maybe the protons are equivalent, but if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same for both enantiomers since they have the same environment. Wait, but in the NMR, if the two enantiomers have the same environment, wouldn't the peaks overlap? Or maybe not, because sometimes in solution, they might not be perfectly identical. But wait, the NMR is done on the crude compound. If it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same as pure because enantiomers give identical 1H NMR. So the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton, unless there's something else.

C) Double coupling during amide bond formation. Hmm, what's that? Maybe during the reaction, two bonds formed but didn't couple correctly. Or perhaps it's something like a diastereomer formation. I'm not too sure about this option. 

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But wait, the question says the NMR peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So if you have diastereomers, the environment around the alpha proton could be different enough to cause two separate peaks. For example, in a peptide, if the configuration is different at a stereocenter, the alpha proton's environment would change, leading to different shifts. But in the NMR, the integrals add up to 1H, so each is 0.5H. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Also,
