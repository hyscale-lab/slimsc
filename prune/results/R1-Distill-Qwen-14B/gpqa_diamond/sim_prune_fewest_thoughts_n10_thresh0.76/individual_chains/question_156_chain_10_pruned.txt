Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves mCPBA and reactions on alkenes. I remember mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Yeah, that's right. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides.

The problem says there are two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, and then aqueous acid. Both reactions go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”standard (achiral) and chiral.

Wait, my first thought is about the products. For epoxidation, the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product. mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. But wait, how does the stereochemistry work here?

E and Z alkenes will form different epoxides. Let me think. The starting alkenes are oct-4-ene, E and Z isomers. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. For each isomer, the epoxide will form with a specific configuration.

Wait, but wait. Oh, right, mCPBA adds in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face. So the reaction is a concerted process that depends on the stereochemistry of the starting alkene.

So, E-oct-4-ene: The substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA reacts, the epoxide forms with the two new oxygen atoms adding on the same face? Or does it form a trans or cis epoxide?

Wait no, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. Let me think: For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are on opposite sides. So when mCPBA adds the epoxide, the oxygen atoms will add to opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide. Or wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, mCPBA is an electrophilic oxidizing agent. It adds
