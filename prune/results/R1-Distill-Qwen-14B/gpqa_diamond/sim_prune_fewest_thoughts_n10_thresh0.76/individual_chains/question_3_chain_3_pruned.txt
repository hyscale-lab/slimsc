Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a spin-half particle in a given state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve the state vector and the operator in question. 

The particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the operator given is 10σz +5σx. Oh right, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. I think σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for spin-up and spin-down states respectively. And σx is a bit trickier because it doesn't share the same eigenstates as σz.

The question asks for the expectation value of 10σz +5σx. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So I'll need to compute this for each part of the operator.

Let me break it down. First, the operator can be separated into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. The expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each part. So, ⟨10σz⟩ + ⟨5σx⟩.

Starting with the σz part: The state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σz. So for any state |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σz is (|a|^2)(+1) + (|b|^2)(-1). 

In this case, a is 0.5, so |a|² is 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|² is (3/4) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10 times that is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Wait, wait, no—wait. Actually, 10σz. So the expectation value is 10 * ⟨σz⟩. So yes, 10*( -0.5) is -5.

Now onto σx. This is a bit more involved because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are not eigenstates of σx. So I can't directly compute it like σz. I'll need to express σx in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. 

I recall that σx is represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. In terms of the basis vectors, σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So to find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute the inner product of the state with itself after applying σx.

Alternatively, I can think of the expectation value as the sum over the basis states. So let's write out the state ψ:

ψ = 0
