Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through it. The question is asking which of the four options has the highest density. Let's see... The options are a, b, c, d, each with different mass and/or density descriptions.

Alright, density is generally mass divided by volume. So higher mass and smaller volume would lead to higher density. But wait, the planets here might have different compositions too. Let me break down each option.

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. That should be similar to Earth itself. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So a would have that density.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, if the density is given, then the planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth. But it's more massive. Since density is mass over volume, if density is same, the volume scales with mass. So if Earth has mass M and volume V, this planet has mass 2M. Since density is same, volume would be 2V. But wait, mass is 2M, volume 2V, density is M/V = (2M)/(2V) = M/V, same as Earth. So b's density is 5.5, same as a. Hmm, but no, the question says 'the following exoplanets' and option b's density is given as 5.5, so I can compare that directly.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Composition same as Earth means same density, right? Because density depends on composition. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so this planet's density would also be 5.5. But wait, if it's 5 times more massive, then the radius would be larger. Since volume scales with radius cubed, so if mass is 5 times and density same, volume would be 5 times. So the radius would be cube root of (5) times Earth's radius. So the density is same as a and b, which is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density again, 5.5. Because same composition, same density. So regardless of mass, density remains same.

Wait, but the options are a, b, c, d. Let me read the options again
