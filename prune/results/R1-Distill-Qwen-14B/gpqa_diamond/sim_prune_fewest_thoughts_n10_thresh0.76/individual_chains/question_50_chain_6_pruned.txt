Okay, so I've got this problem about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on the given expression. Let me think about how Feynman diagrams relate to loop counts and their dependence on coupling constants and other factors.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process, often connected to the perturbation expansion. Each loop typically contributes a factor of the coupling constant (like alpha or g), but I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula.

Wait, the given expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. So I need to break this down. Let me see, what do I know about dimensional analysis or the structure of loop integrals?

In loop integrals, especially in four-dimensional spacetime, the integral often introduces factors of pi and powers of the energy scale. The 1/(4pi)^6 term catches my eye. Since each loop in four dimensions usually contributes a factor of (4pi)^{d/2}, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, for a loop integral in 4D, each loop would contribute a (4pi)^{-2} factor, right? Because the integral dimension is four, so (4pi)^{4/2} = (4pi)^2, but it's in the denominator because of the measure, so each loop might add 1/(4pi)^2.

Wait, so if each loop contributes 1/(4pi)^2, then how many loops would give us (1/(4pi))^6? Let me count the exponents. The denominator is (4pi)^6, so that would be (1/(4pi)^2)^3. So that would imply 3 loops? Because each loop gives a (1/(4pi)^2) factor, and three loops would be (1/(4pi)^2)^3 = 1/(4pi)^6.

But wait, I should check the other parts. The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * ... So alpha is the fine structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0 something) but in QED, each photon vertex is proportional to e, so each loop involving electrons would have factors of e. But this seems to be a
