Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I think that's a two-component vector, right? So the state is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. But wait, in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors, so that makes sense.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator. So for S_y, I need to find the expectation value which is ψ† σ_y ħ/2 ψ, because I think that the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, right, S_x, S_y, S_z are each (ħ/2) times σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So the state is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. Let me write that down: ψ is a column vector with first element 3i and second element 4. To calculate the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩ multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, σ_y is given as the matrix:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So the steps are: 

1. Write down ψ as a column vector.
2. Compute ψ†, the conjugate transpose of ψ.
3. Multiply ψ† by σ_y, which is a 2x2 matrix.
4. Then multiply the result by ψ.
5. The resulting scalar will be the expectation value, then multiply by ħ/2 for S_y.

Wait, let me clarify. The expectation value for S_y is ⟨ψ| (σ_y ħ/2) |ψ⟩, so I can factor out the ħ/2 and compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩, then multiply by ħ/2.

So first, let's compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

Let me compute each part step by step.

ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So ψ† is [ -3 (since 3i conjugate is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait,
