Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming problem about a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question describes a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to each other. Hmm, meta means each is separated by two carbons, right? So if one is at position 1, the next would be at 3, and the third at 5? Or maybe it's about their relative positions.

Wait, meta positioning is when substituents are on positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring. So each substituent is two positions apart. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then the carbaldehyde would be at 3, and the cyano at 5. Or any other combination as long as they're all meta.

Also, the problem states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh wait, ortho is positions adjacent. So if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 would be ortho. So in this case, position 2 and 6 would have OH and N(CH3)2 groups.

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The para position is across the ring, so if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the para is position 4. So position 4 has OMe.

Wait, but the question also says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile (cyano group) is at some position where both OH and OMe are ortho to it.

Let me try to draw this out mentally. Let's assign positions to each group.

Let me number the benzene ring starting with the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then, the positions go 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Given that the carboxylic acid is at 1, the meta substituents would be carbaldehyde (CHO) and cyano (CN) groups. So COOH is at 1, CHO
