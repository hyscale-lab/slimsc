Okay, so I've got this ChIP-seq question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my epigenetics, but let's try to think through it.

The question is about why certain peaks disappeared when using PFA+DSG fixation instead of just PFA. Right, so ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind. IKAROS is a transcription factor, so they're looking for its binding sites in human B cells.

Wait, what's the deal with PFA and DSG? I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is used for crosslinking. When you fix cells with PFA, it cross-links proteins to DNA. But sometimes, for better crosslinking, they might also use something like DSG, which is a stronger crosslinker, I think. Or maybe DSG is for longer crosslinking or more efficient? Or perhaps it's for crosslinking proteins that are not easily captured with just PFA.

So the experiment: they did ChIP-seq with PFA-fixed samples and saw peaks, but when they used PFA+DSG, the peaks disappeared. Why would that happen?

Let me recall: in ChIP experiments, crosslinking is a crucial step. If the crosslinking is too strong, maybe some epitopes are not accessible anymore. So the antibody might not bind as effectively if the crosslinking is too harsh.

Wait, I think DSG is a more efficient crosslinker compared to PFA. Or maybe it's used for more thorough crosslinking, perhaps leading to larger protein complexes being fixed. Alternatively, maybe PFA is a reversible crosslinker, but DSG is not?

Wait no, I'm getting confused. PFA is a common crosslinker, which forms stable, covalent bonds between proteins and DNA. DSG is another crosslinker, perhaps used in combination for more efficient crosslinking. Oh wait, DSG stands for disuccinimide, which is a carbodiimide-based crosslinker. It's used in some protocols to crosslink proteins that are not easily fixed by formaldehyde alone. So using DSG along with PFA might make the crosslinking more effective.

But why would the ChIP peaks disappear when using DSG? Let me think about the effect on the antibody's ability to bind. If the crosslinking is too strong, the epitope might be masked. That is, the protein-D
