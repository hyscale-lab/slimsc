Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electron scattering, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that we have measured phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts given are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. We're supposed to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D with various values in fm.

Hmm. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The general formula I think is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l) ) ] 

Wait, no, more accurately, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ) = Σ [ (2l + 1) * ( e^{iδ_l} - 1 ) * ( (sin δ_l) ) / (k) ) ] 

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing terms. Let me think. The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] * (sin δ_l) / (cos δ_l) ?

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f is related to the optical theorem, which connects the total cross-section to the imaginary part of f at zero angle. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which I think is θ=0, so forward scattering.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the angle, it just says along the incident beam direction. So that's θ=0°, right? So I need to find Im[f(0)].

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I might be confusing different approaches. Let me get back to basics.

The scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of partial waves. The general formula is:

f(θ
