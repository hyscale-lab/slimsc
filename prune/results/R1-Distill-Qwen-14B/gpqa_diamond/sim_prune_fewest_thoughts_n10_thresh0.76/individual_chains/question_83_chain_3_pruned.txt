Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to tackle it, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25 °C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out the concentrations after dilution and during titration. Let's break it down.

Initial step: Diluting acetic acid. When you mix two solutions, you can calculate the new concentration by considering the dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid would be concentration times volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration would be moles over total volume, which is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since it's a dilution, the formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / (40 cm³) )= 0.025 M. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Let me find out how much NaOH is needed for equivalence.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 moles (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles. Volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But the question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The equivalence volume is 10 cm³. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So during titration, when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added, that's 25% done.

Now, for the two cases: 25% titration and equivalence.

First case: 25% titration.

At 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, after adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, which reacts with acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed would be 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total solution volume at this point is initial solution (40 cm³) plus added NaOH (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(1.85e-5
