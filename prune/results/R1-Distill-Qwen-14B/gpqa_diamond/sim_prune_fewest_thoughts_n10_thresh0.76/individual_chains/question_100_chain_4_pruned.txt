Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what's going on.

The question describes a reaction sequence starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. So, C3H6 is likely propene because that's an alkene with the formula C3H6. Wait, no, wait. Propene is C3H6? Hmm, no, wait. Wait, propene is C3H6? Let me think. No, wait. Propene is actually C3H6â€”right, because the formula for an alkene is CnH2n. So for n=3, that's C3H6. So yeah, Compound A is propene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, right, that's a typical bromination using a bromine in a nonpolar solvent, which would do an addition reaction for alkenes. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3?) Wait, no, propene is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the structure is CH2CH2CH3, but the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So when bromine adds across the double bond, it would form 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3?

Wait, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding bromine across the double bond would be via an anti addition, leading to 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Or maybe the structure is CH2Br-CH2-CH2Br? No, wait. Let me think again. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. No, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when bromine (Br2) adds, it would add across the double bond. The addition would be anti, so the two Brs would be on adjacent carbons, across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's Compound B.

Then, Compound
