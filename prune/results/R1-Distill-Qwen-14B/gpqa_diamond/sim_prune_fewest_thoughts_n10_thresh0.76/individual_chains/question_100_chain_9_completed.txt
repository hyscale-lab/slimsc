Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, that's a molecular formula I remember. C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, cyclopropane is a ring structure, right? But when I think about what happens next, bromination in CCl4. Oh, right! That's a typical addition reaction for alkenes. So if A is propene, adding Br2 would cause an addition across the double bond. So if A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3?), adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, the addition is usually across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2 to give 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2Br-CHBr-CH3), that's compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good nucleophile, maybe hydroxide ions would dehydrohalogenate it. So in an elimination reaction, we lose HBr. For a dibromide, which positions would eliminate? If B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when KOH is added, it would likely eliminate to form an alkene. The possible alkenes would depend on where the elimination occurs. Let's see: if we lose H from C1 and Br from C2, or vice versa. The major product would probably be propene again, but wait, if it's 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination could give either 1-propene or 2-propene, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, which is 1-propene. Alternatively, could it form cyclopropane? No, because elimination of two adjacent Brs would form an alkene, not a ring. So compound C is probably propene again. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. If B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then elimination would form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, 2-propene is CH3CH=CH2, which is propene as well, but maybe in a different position. So C is probably propene, which is CH2=CHCH3.

Then, passing compound C through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, that sounds like a dehydrogenation reaction. Iron as a catalyst? Oh, wait, when alkenes are passed over iron or another metal, it can cause dehydrogenation to form an alkane. Wait, no: wait, if you have propene (CH2=CHCH3), passing it through a red-hot iron tube might cause it to lose hydrogen and form something. Wait, iron is a catalyst in some hydrogenation reactions, but wait, no, maybe it's a dehydrogenation to form something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a way to form benzene rings, but that's for aromatic compounds. Hmm, wait, another thought: propene (CH2=CHCH3) when passed over a hot iron catalyst might undergo dehydrogenation to form propane. Wait, but propane is just CH3CH2CH3, which is an alkane. So compound D would be propane. Hmm, but wait, does that make sense? Because when you heat an alkene with a metal like iron, you usually hydrogenate it, but maybe without H2, it's dehydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, but no, that's elimination. Wait, maybe the process is the dehydrogenation of propane to form something else. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Another possibility: maybe the reaction is the formation of acetylene. Oh, wait! If you heat propene with a metal like iron, it might dehydrohalogenate, but wait, wait. No, another approach: propene on heating can lose hydrogen to form something else. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another possibility is that the propene is being dehydrogenated to form propylene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts propene into another structure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a diene? No, I'm getting stuck here. Wait, perhaps the reaction is to form cyclopropane. How? Oh, wait, I think I'm mixing up reactions. Maybe if propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes a cyclization to form cyclopropane. Because cyclopropane rings can form under certain conditions. Hmm. Let me think: cyclopropane is a three-membered ring with two double bonds, but I think the formation is via a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's under different conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydrogenation process. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on this part. Let me see the next step and see if that helps.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form compound E. Two strong acids? Maybe sulfuric and nitric acid, which together can act as a nitrating agent. So if D is propane, which is an alkane, nitrating it would require the presence of a catalyst, perhaps. But alkanes are usually not nitrated under normal conditions. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else, like propylene, but I thought D was propane. Alternatively, maybe D is something that can be nitrated, like an aromatic compound. Wait, but propane isn't aromatic. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back. So, let me re-examine the steps.

Wait, so step by step:

A: C3H6. Possible structures: propene (CH2=CHCH3), cyclopropane (C3H6 as well), or maybe another isomer. But let's think about the reaction sequence. The first reaction is bromination in CCl4, which is a typical addition for alkenes. So A must have a double bond. So A is propene. So when propene reacts with Br2 in CCl4, it adds across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3), which is B.

Then, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, so it's an E2 elimination. So B is a vicinal dibromide, so eliminating two Br atoms would form an alkene. The structure of B is CH2BrCHBrCH3. When KOH (alcohol) is added, the hydroxide would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and the formation of a double bond. So the product C would be propene again? Wait, no, because if B is CH2BrCHBrCH3, elimination would form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, but 1-propene is CH2=CHCH3 and 2-propene is CH3CH=CH2. So the major product might be 1-propene, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the major product is 1-propene. So C is propene.

Then, propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube. This is a bit confusing. I think I remember that when alkenes are treated with a metal like iron in a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, maybe the process is a dehydrogenation. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would lose hydrogen to form something else. What's the product of dehydrogenation of propene? Oh! It could form propylene. Wait, propylene is the same as propene. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of acetylene. If you pass propene over hot iron, perhaps it dehydrogenates to form acetylene (CH≡CHCH3?), but wait, no, that's not possible because acetylene has two triple bonds; but wait, propene has three carbons. So perhaps it forms something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of cyclopropane. Oh, wait! I think I've heard that when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it can form cyclopropane. Because cyclopropane can be made from propene via a [2+2] cycloaddition, but that's under specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-forming reaction. So D would be cyclopropane (C3H6 again, but as a ring structure). Wait, but cyclopropane is a three-membered ring, so it's C3H6. So D is cyclopropane.

Then, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. So cyclopropane reacting with H2SO4 and HNO3, perhaps. Wait, but cyclopropane is an alkane derivative. Nitration typically requires aromatic rings. But cyclopropane doesn't have a benzene ring. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else. Wait, another approach: maybe the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, which are used for nitration. But nitration usually occurs on aromatic rings. So unless cyclopropane can undergo some kind of electrophilic substitution, which I don't think it does. So perhaps I'm wrong about D being cyclopropane. Let me think again. Maybe D is propane. So if C is propene, and when passed through red-hot iron, it gets hydrogenated to propane. So D is propane (C3H8). Then, D reacts with two strong acids, which could be H2SO4 and HNO3, leading to nitration. But alkanes are generally not nitrated under normal conditions because they don't have the necessary reactivity. So that's a problem. So perhaps D isn't propane. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else.

Wait, another approach: maybe the red-hot iron is causing the alkene (propene) to lose hydrogen and form another alkene. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the process is the formation of an alkyne. So, propene could lose hydrogen to form propyne (CH≡C-CH3). But I'm not sure about the reaction conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of allene (CH2=C=CH2), but that's for longer alkenes. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I need to consider another angle.

Wait, let me think about the next step. D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. If D is propane, maybe it's being sulfonated or nitrated, but as I said, that's hard. But if D is something else, say, cyclopropane, perhaps the reaction is different. Wait, another thought: perhaps D is propene, and the reaction with two strong acids is something else. Wait, but I thought the iron step gives D. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are as follows:

A is propene (CH2=CHCH3). React with Br2 in CCl4 to get 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Then, B with alcoholic KOH (elimination) gives back propene (C). Then, C (propene) is passed through red-hot iron, which could be a catalyst for hydrogenation. Wait, no, because if you add hydrogen, propene would become propane. But, without H2, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe the process is forming cyclopropane via a [2+2] cycloaddition. But I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the iron is causing the alkene to undergo a ring-forming reaction, like a [3π] electrocyclic closure. But that's more about changing the double bond's position. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation again, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's say that D is propane. Then, reacting with two strong acids, maybe H2SO4 and HNO3, leads to nitration. But as I said, alkanes don't get nitrated under normal conditions. So perhaps E is not formed, which would mean that my earlier reasoning is wrong. Therefore, maybe D isn't propane.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the propene is being dehydrogenated to form acetylene. For acetylene, the formula would be C3H4. So D would be propyne, CH3C≡CH. Then, when D reacts with two strong acids, perhaps it's being nitrated. But how? Acetylenes can undergo nitration under certain conditions, maybe with a nitrating mixture. So if D is propyne, then E would be the nitrated product, perhaps. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each step's possible reactions again.

1. A (C3H6) → bromination in CCl4 → B (1,2-dibromopropane)
2. B → alcoholic KOH → C (propene)
3. C → red-hot iron → D (maybe cyclopropane)
4. D → two strong acids → E (could be a nitro compound if D is an aromatic ring, but cyclopropane isn't aromatic. So this is a problem.)

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and when it reacts with strong acids, maybe it's sulfonated, but that's again not typical. So perhaps I'm wrong in my initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the initial steps are different. Let me think again.

Compound A is C3H6. Let's think about whether it's cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is a three-membered ring, which is C3H6 as well. Bromination in CCl4 is a substitution reaction for cyclopropane? Wait, no, cyclopropane is saturated, so bromination typically doesn't substitute unless in special conditions. So maybe A is propene, not cyclopropane. So that's settled.

So B is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCHBrCH3). Then, C is propene again. Then, propene passed through red-hot iron. Maybe that's a hydrogenation catalyst. So adding H2 with Fe as catalyst would hydrogenate the double bond to form propane (CH3CH2CH3). So D would be propane.

Then, propane reacts with two strong acids (maybe H2SO4 and HNO3, which is the nitrating mixture). But alkanes are not typically nitrated. So perhaps this is a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the acids are something else. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HCl, which can provide H+ and act as a catalyst for some reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is propane and E is something else. Another approach: perhaps when propane is treated with strong acids, it undergoes some kind of substitution, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe E is hydrogen chloride, but that doesn't fit with the description.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the reactions again.

Wait, another thought: when an alkene is treated with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid, it can undergo a process called nitration. So if D is an alkene, perhaps it's getting nitrated. Wait, but in our case, D is the product after passing propene through red-hot iron. If D is propane, then it's an alkane and can't be nitrated. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try to think differently.

When propene is treated with Br2 in CCl4, you get 1,2-dibromopropane (B). Then, B is treated with alcoholic KOH, which would eliminate HBr to form propene (C). Then, C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. Wait, perhaps this is a process called catalytic hydrogenation. So propene (C) is hydrogenated to propane (D). Then, D is propane. Reacting D with two strong acids (like H2SO4 and HNO3) perhaps for nitration, but as I said, that's tough. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation reaction, but again, alkanes don't react.

Alternatively, perhaps the two strong acids are HCl and H2SO4, and the reaction is something else. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and another acid, like HNO3, but the reaction is different. Maybe it's a hydration reaction. Wait, but D is propane, which is already saturated.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the next steps to see if that helps.

Compound E reacts with a mixture of iron scrap and HCl to form F. Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Finally, G reacts with NaOH to form H.

So, E is a product of D reacting with two strong acids. If E is a nitro compound, then when it reacts with Fe and HCl, it might undergo the reduction of nitro groups to amines. So E could be a nitroalkane, which upon reduction with Fe and HCl would form an amine (F). Then, treating F with nitrous acid would form G. Nitrous acid typically converts primary amines to diazonium salts, which then can decompose to form nitro compounds or other products depending on conditions. Then, G reacting with NaOH would form H. For example, diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenols or other products.

But let's get back. So, if E is a nitro compound, then D must be something that can undergo nitration. So maybe D is cyclopropane. Wait, but cyclopropane is not aromatic, so how would it undergo nitration? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something else. Let me think again.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction when propene is passed through a red-hot iron tube is a dehydrogenation to form acetylene. So D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Then, propyne can undergo nitration to form a nitrile? Or perhaps the reaction with two strong acids is a hydration to form ketones. Wait, but propyne is an alkyne, which can be hydrated to a ketone. So maybe D is propyne, and reacting with H2SO4 and H2O (from the acid) would form acetone (propan-2-one). But the question says a mixture of two strong acids, so perhaps not water. Alternatively, the two strong acids could be H2SO4 and HNO3, and perhaps the reaction is a nitration. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane. Then, using the two strong acids, maybe it's being converted into something else. Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the next steps and see if I can find something that makes sense.

Suppose E is a nitrated product. Then, F is the amine formed by reduction. Let's say E is a nitroalkane, so F would be an amine. Then, treating F with nitrous acid would form a diazonium salt (G). Then, G treated with NaOH could form a phenol or an amine.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option.

The question asks which statement is incorrect about the products.

Options:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Well, if F is aniline or a substituted amine, those can be used in dye synthesis. So this could be correct.

B) H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride solution. That sounds like a test for a phenol. Phenols give a yellow precipitate with FeCl3. So if H is a phenol, then B is correct.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra. So D's structure must have two sets of protons, each as singlets. For example, if D is cyclopropane, the protons are all equivalent and would give a single peak. But if D is propane, then the two end CH3 groups would be equivalent, giving a singlet, but wait, in propane, the central CH2 would be between two CH3s. But wait, in propane (CH3CH2CH3), the central CH2 has two neighboring CH3 groups. So the NMR would show a singlet for the CH2 (but wait, no. Wait, the CH3 groups are on either end, each with three equivalent protons. The CH2 in the middle is a quartet? No, wait, in 1H NMR, the CH2 in propane is a quartet because of coupling with the adjacent CH3. Wait, no, that's for ethyl groups. Wait, no, propane's structure is CH3-CH2-CH3. The central CH2 group is between two CH3 groups. Each CH3 is a triplet (since each CH2 has two Hs, so n+1 =2+1=3), but wait, no, wait, in reality, the CH3 groups are split by the adjacent CH2. So each CH3 is a triplet, and the CH2 is a quartet. So the NMR would have two triplets (each CH3) and a quartet (CH2). So option C says D gives two singlets. But wait, if D is cyclopropane, then all three protons are equivalent and would appear as a singlet. So if D is cyclopropane, the NMR would show a single peak, which doesn't match option C. On the other hand, if D is propane, then the NMR would show a triplet and a quartet, not two singlets. Hmm. So perhaps D is something else.

Wait, another possibility: if D is propyne (CH3C≡CH), then the structure has two different types of Hs. The terminal H (sp-hybridized) would be a singlet, and the middle CH3 would also be a singlet. So the 1H NMR would show two singlets, which matches option C. So if D is propyne, then option C is correct. But earlier steps would need to form propyne from propene through dehydrogenation.

Another possibility: D is cyclopropane, which would give a singlet, but that doesn't fit option C, which says two singlets. Hmm.

So let's tie this together. Let's go back.

If D is propyne, then E could be the product of propyne reacting with two strong acids. Propyne is an alkyne, and treatment with H2SO4 and HNO3 could lead to nitration. Alternatively, perhaps it undergoes hydration in the presence of acid to form a ketone. But the question says it reacts with two strong acids to form E. If E is a nitro compound, then when F is formed by reaction with Fe and HCl, it would be an amine.

If F is aniline, then G would be the diazonium salt, which could decompose to form a phenol under aqueous conditions, but that's when treated with H2O. Alternatively, if F is a substituted aniline, then G would be a diazonium salt that could form a phenol upon hydrolysis, giving H as a phenol. So option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3, which would be correct if H is a phenol.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propyne (CH3C≡CH), then the CH3 group would be a singlet (no neighboring Hs) and the terminal H would be a singlet as well. So yes, two singlets. So option C is correct.

Option D says C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas under standard conditions and highly flammable. So option D is correct.

Option A says F is used for dye synthesis. F is an amine, which is correct because many dyes are based on aromatic amines like aniline. So A is correct.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with FeCl3. H is a phenol, which would form a precipitate with FeCl3. So B is correct.

Wait, but the question asks for the incorrect statement. So all options are correct except one. But I thought all of them seem correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of D. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when propene (C) is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a process called dehydrogenation to form acetylene. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) loses H2 to form propyne (CH≡CCH3). So D is propyne.

Then, D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids to form E. What reaction could this be? Propyne is an alkyne, and in the presence of strong acids, perhaps it undergoes hydration to form a ketone. So E would be acetone (propan-2-one). So E is (CH3)2CO.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. But wait, Fe and HCl are typically used to reduce nitro groups in aromatic compounds to amines. Acetone doesn't have a nitro group, so this step doesn't make sense. So perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Hmm, maybe the two strong acids are causing a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a sulfonation. But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps D is propane, and the reaction with two strong acids is a sulfonation to form a sulfonic acid. But alkanes don't react easily with sulfonic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the two acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, and E is the nitro compound, perhaps via a substitution. But I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propane, then its NMR would have a quartet (CH2) and two triplets (CH3), so option C would be incorrect. But if D is propyne, then NMR would have two singlets (CH3 and the terminal H), so C is correct.

So, if the NMR of D shows two singlets, then D must be propyne. So option C is correct only if D is propyne.

But then, E would be something else. So if D is propyne, then reacting with two strong acids could be a nitration, forming a nitrile. Wait, nitriles are typically formed from alkynes under different conditions, like with a nitrating agent under high pressure. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nitrile.

Then, E (nitrile) reacts with Fe and HCl. Fe and HCl are used in the reduction of nitro groups to amines, but nitriles are typically reduced to amines using other methods, like LiAlH4. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nitro compound, and F is the amine.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nitrile, which when treated with Fe and HCl, forms an amine. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a ketone, like acetone, and F is a secondary amine, but I don't see how that would work.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me see the options again.

The question says, which statement is incorrect. So, if I can figure out which statement is wrong, that would be the answer.

Looking at option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. If D is propane, the NMR would not have two singlets. So if option C is incorrect, then D must be propane. Because propane's NMR would have two types of protons: the two CH3 groups (each as a triplet) and the CH2 as a quartet. So option C, which says two singlets, would be incorrect. So if D is propane, then option C is the incorrect statement.

But earlier steps would need to form D as propane. So, if the reaction with red-hot iron converts propene to propane, then D is propane. Then, when D reacts with two strong acids, perhaps to form something else. But as I thought earlier, maybe E is not formed, which would make the entire sequence incorrect, but the question is about the options given.

So, if the incorrect statement is option C, then the answer would be C. Alternatively, if another option is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: if D is propane, then E would be the product of propane reacting with two strong acids. But as I said before, alkanes don't react easily. So perhaps E is not formed, but the question says E is formed, so maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the two strong acids are H2SO4 and another acid, but I'm not seeing the reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfonation reaction, but again, alkanes don't react. So perhaps the initial steps are correct, and the incorrect statement is option C.

So, putting it all together:

A is propene.

B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

C is propene.

D is propane.

E is not formed, but the question says it is, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that D is propane, and when reacted with two strong acids, it forms something else. But without knowing, perhaps I should proceed.

If D is propane, and the NMR shows two singlets, that's incorrect. So option C is incorrect if D is propane.

But wait, the NMR of propane (CH3CH2CH3) would have:

- The two terminal CH3 groups: each is a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH2). But since they're equivalent, they'd appear as a single triplet integrating to 6H.

- The central CH2 group: a quartet (coupled with the two CH3 groups), integrating to 2H.

So the 1H NMR would show two sets of peaks: a triplet (6H) and a quartet (2H). So no, option C, which says two singlets, is incorrect.

Therefore, the incorrect statement would be option C.

But wait, the options are about the products. So according to the sequence, D is propane, which would have the NMR as I described. So option C is incorrect because D's NMR does not show two singlets.

So the incorrect statement is option C.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A (C₃H₆), which is identified as propene (CH₂=CHCH₃) because bromination in CCl₄ is a typical reaction for alkenes. Bromination adds Br₂ across the double bond, forming 1,2-dibromopropane (Compound B). When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, an elimination reaction occurs, removing two HBr molecules to regenerate propene (Compound C).

Compound C (propene) is then passed through a red-hot iron tube, which likely causes hydrogenation, converting the alkene into propane (Compound D). Propane (C₃H₈) is an alkane, and its ¹H NMR spectrum would show a triplet for the two equivalent CH₃ groups (6H) and a quartet for the CH₂ group (2H). This means the NMR spectrum of D does not consist of two singlets, making Option C incorrect.

Compound D (propane) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, likely H₂SO₄ and HNO₃, though alkanes are generally unreactive under these conditions. This step is unclear, but the sequence continues with E, F, G, and H being formed through subsequent reactions. Compound F is likely an amine, which can be used in dye synthesis (making Option A correct). Compound H is likely a phenol, which reacts with FeCl₃ to give a yellow precipitate (making Option B correct). Compound C (propene) is a flammable gas (making Option D correct).

The incorrect statement is Option C, as D (propane) does not give two singlets in its ¹H NMR spectrum.

Answer: C
