Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem about the Michael reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, right? So, let me try to break down each part step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to find the products for each. Then, I have to match the options given.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, so it's probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. It has two ester groups, so when deprotonated, the enolate can attack. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be something like CH2=CH-p-tolyl with an ester group. Wait no, wait: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl-O-CO-CH3? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- as the substituent. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the middle carbon? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the acrylate group as CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but linked to the p-tolyl group at position 3. So the structure is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, maybe the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CHCOOCH2-p-tolyl? Or maybe the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3 position. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again
