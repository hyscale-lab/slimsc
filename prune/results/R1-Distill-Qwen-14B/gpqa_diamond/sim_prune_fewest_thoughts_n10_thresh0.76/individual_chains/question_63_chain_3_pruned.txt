Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions can involve both rotational and vibrational changes, but I'm not too sure about the specifics here.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about after absorbing a photon, so it's about energy transitions.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model... Oh, right, that's the non-rigid rotor model. Unlike the rigid rotor, which assumes the bond length is fixed, the non-rigid model allows for bond stretching. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy transitions. Maybe the energy levels are different because the bond can change length a bit.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. The energy for a rotational state is (ħ² l(l+1))/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For the vibrational part, the harmonic oscillator model says energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2)ħω. But I'm not sure if the question is considering both rotational and vibrational transitions or just one.

Wait, the question mentions the fundamental state. In quantum mechanics, the fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state. But I think in molecular vibrations, the fundamental transition is from the ground state (n=0) to the first excited state (n=1). So maybe this photon would cause a vibrational transition.

Alternatively, in rotation, the fundamental transition is from J=0 to J=1. But the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Hmm, so the next state after the fundamental (ground) state would involve the smallest possible energy increase. That could be either a rotation or vibration transition, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but the question is about the momentum of the photon. Energy of a photon is E = p
