Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

First off, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So when Grubbs is involved, the main process is ring-closing metathesis if it's a cyclic compound, or cross-metathesis if there are different alkenes. But wait, in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure.

So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is at position 1, so structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, position 1 is the first carbon. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's see: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would add a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene should be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let's number from the double bond. Position 1 and 2 are the double bond. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be 3-methylpentene. Wait, no, let's count: pent is five carbons. 1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Carbon 1: double bond starts here. So 1 is
