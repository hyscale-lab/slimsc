Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, right? So for a given orbital angular momentum l, m can range from -l to +l. But since the problem says small m, maybe we're dealing with cases where m is not too large, like m=0 or m=1 or something like that.

The problem is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE. The transition energy is given a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. I remember that the transition energy relates to the photon energy via E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that.

First, let's get the value of ΔE. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. Wait, 1 micrometer is 1000 nanometers, so yeah, 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So, E = hc/λ.

Let me compute that: h = 6.626e-34, c=3e8, λ=486.1e-9 meters. So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by λ: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approximately 4.088e-19 J. But wait, that's in Joules. Let me convert that to electron volts because I'm more familiar with energies in eV. 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is roughly 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV. That sounds about right for a hydrogen transition; the Balmer series is around 2 to 3 eV, so that checks out.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait in this case, the orbital part and spin part. Oh right, the paramagnetic term can come from the orbital contribution as well
