Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's see. I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So the formula is plx = 1/distance. 

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars is the same per unit volume. But wait, how does that translate when we're looking at parallax?

I think I should consider the volume of space that corresponds to a given parallax range. Parallax plx is 1/d, so higher plx means closer stars. Wait, no, higher plx would mean closer because closer stars have larger parallax. Or wait, plx is measured in arcseconds, and it's inversely proportional to distance. So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond. A star at 2 parsecs has 0.5 arcseconds, and so on.

So if I consider a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding range in distance? Let's see, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So for a small change in plx, the change in distance would be... Let me think. 

If plx is small, like approaching zero, then d is very large. So a small change in plx near zero would correspond to a large change in distance. Wait, maybe I should think about the volume between two distances. 

The volume between distance d and d + dd is a spherical shell. The volume is (4/3)π ( (d+dd)^3 - d^3 ) ≈ 4π d² dd (since (d+dd)^3 ≈ d^3 + 3d² dd). 

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume. So n ∝ 4π d² dd. 

But we need to express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So substituting d into the volume: n ∝ 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd), but wait, what's dd in terms of dplx (change in parallax)?
