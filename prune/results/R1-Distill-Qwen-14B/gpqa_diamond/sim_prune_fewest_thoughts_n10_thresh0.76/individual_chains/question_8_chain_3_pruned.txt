Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this genetics question. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in white lupine plants. These genes are candidates for contributing to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They created knockout mutants for each gene and some double mutants as well. The results show the resistance levels of these mutants compared to the wild type.

So, the resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild type) which is 100%. Let me list out the data:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3:10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

The question is about the interaction among these genes. The options suggest different possibilities involving transcription factors, pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis.

I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of B is only seen when A is functional. Or wait, sometimes it's the other way around. I think the key is to look at how the double mutants behave.

Also, the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors are usually upstream, regulating other genes.

Looking at the data:

- Wild type is 100% resistant. So, without any mutations, the plants are resistant.

G2 knockout (g2) has 0% resistance. That means without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. So G2 is really crucial. Since G2 is knocked out and resistance is zero, perhaps G2 is involved in a critical pathway. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor because it's upstream.

G1 knockout (g1) has 75% resistance. So the plant is still somewhat resistant, but less than wild type. So G1 contributes to resistance, but isn't as essential as G2.

G3 knockout (g3) is 50% resistance. So it's even less resistant than g1. Wait, so G3 is more important than G1 in terms of resistance.

Now the double mutants: 

g1g2: 0% resistance. Both genes are knocked out. Since g2 alone is 0%, adding g1 might not change anything. So maybe G1's function is redundant when G2 is absent. Or perhaps G2 is upstream of G1.

g1g3: 10% resistance. That's lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So the double mutant is worse than either single. So perhaps G1 and G3 function in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. Or maybe G1 and G3 interact in a way that each provides some additive function.

g2g3: 0% resistance. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, no resistance. But since g2 alone is already 0%, this makes sense—maybe G3 doesn't contribute anything when G2 is already gone.

Hmm, I think I should consider the concept of epistasis. If a double mutant's phenotype is the same as one of the single mutants, that suggests epistasis. For example, if g1g2 has 0% resistance, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic over G1. Because when G2 is not working, the presence of G1 doesn't matter—resistance is gone.

Wait, because in g1g2, the plant is as bad as g2. So the presence of G1 in the g2 mutant doesn't help. So G2 is epistatic over G1. Because the effect of G1 is masked by the absence of G2.

So G2 is epistatic towards G1. That fits with option A or C or D.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. But G2's resistance is 0%; if G2 were a TF, that makes sense since the TF might activate other genes. But the data suggests G2 is a key gene, possibly a transcription factor.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1. Hmm, same promoter would mean they're part of the same operon or regulated similarly. Not sure if that's the case here.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G1 is epistatic, meaning when G1 is non-functional, G3's function doesn't matter.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Redundancy would mean when one is present, the other can compensate, but both are needed for full function. So, if you have either G1 or G3, you get some function.

Looking at the data again, the g1g3 double mutant has 10% resistance. That's much lower than either single mutant. If G1 and G3 were redundant, you might expect that knocking out both would lower resistance less than each single, but that's not the case here. Because in single mutants, G3 shows 50% and G1 shows 75%—so knocking out both would be worse than either. So that fits with them perhaps acting in parallel pathways. Alternatively, maybe they have additive effects.

Wait, but what about the fact that g2g3 is 0%? Since g2 alone is 0%, that makes sense. So G3's function is only relevant when G2 is present.

So, considering G2 is a transcription factor. Let's say G2 activates both G1 and G3. Then, if G2 is knocked out, both G1 and G3 aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but in the data, the single g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So without G1, there's still some resistance (maybe G2 is working and activating G3, which is 50% when G3 is knocked out). 

Wait
