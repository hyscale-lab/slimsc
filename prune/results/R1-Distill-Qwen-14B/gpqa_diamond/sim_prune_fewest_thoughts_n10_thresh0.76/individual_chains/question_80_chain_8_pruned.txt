Okay, so I've got this question here about an algorithm that takes DNA sequences as input and outputs some numbers. My task is to figure out what the algorithm does and then apply it to the given sequence ACAGTGACC to choose the correct answer from the options provided.

Let me start by looking at the examples given. The first one is AGG giving 115. Hmm, AGG is a DNA triplet, maybe a codon? But wait, how does that translate to 115? Let me think about possible ways to convert letters to numbers.

Each letter in the DNA sequence is A, T, C, or G. Maybe each letter corresponds to a number. Let's see: A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4? Let me test that with the first example.

AGG would be A(1) + G(4) + G(4). Wait, but AGG has three letters, so 1 + 4 +4 = 9. But the output is 115. So that can't be it. Maybe multiplication instead? 1 *4 *4 =16. Still not 115. Hmm, maybe each letter is assigned a two-digit number, but that seems complicated.

Wait another approach: perhaps each nucleotide is converted into its position in the alphabet. A is 1, T is 20 (since T is the 20th letter?), wait no, wait. Wait, A is 1, T is 20? Wait, let me think. A is the first letter, T is the 20th? No, T is actually the 20th letter if you consider the English alphabet, but wait, in the context of DNA, the letters are A, T, C, G. So perhaps each is assigned a number based on their order in this set. So A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me try that again.

AGG: A=1, G=4, G=4. So 1*4*4 =16. But the output is 115. Hmm, not matching. Wait, maybe adding them: 1+4+4=9. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe each letter is converted to a specific number and then summed. Let's think of other possibilities. What if each letter is assigned a value
