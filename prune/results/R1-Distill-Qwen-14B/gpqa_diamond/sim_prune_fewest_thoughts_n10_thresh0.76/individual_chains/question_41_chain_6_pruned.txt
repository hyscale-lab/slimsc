Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light propagating through a moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in a medium, the speed of light depends on the medium's refractive index. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. But wait, in this case, the glass itself is moving. So do I need to consider the relative velocity between the light and the moving glass?

I think this is a problem involving relative velocities and perhaps the addition of velocities. Oh wait, but the glass is moving, so from the lab frame, the light's speed would be... Hmm, perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. But wait, when velocities are much smaller than c, maybe the classical approach is sufficient. But the problem states to take c=1, so perhaps it's using non-relativistic approach.

Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, the overall speed observed in the lab frame would be the vector sum of the light's velocity in the medium and the medium's velocity. Oh wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and if the medium is moving, the observed speed of the light would be c/n plus the medium's velocity, but only if we're using the Galilean addition. Because in classical mechanics, velocities add linearly.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n relative to the glass. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (c/n) + v, but wait, because the glass is moving towards the observer, so the light's speed would be higher? Or lower? Wait, no, if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and the beam is going towards the observer, then the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the beam's speed as seen by the lab would be the speed of the beam in the glass plus the speed of the glass, right?

Wait, but wait. Let me model this. Let's say in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed u = c/n, right? Because the refractive index is n, so u = c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So, from the lab frame, the light's velocity would be u + v. Wait, but wait, u is already directed towards the observer? No, wait, the beam is moving through the glass towards the observer. So the beam's velocity in the glass's frame is towards the observer, so if the glass is moving towards the observer as well, then the beam's
