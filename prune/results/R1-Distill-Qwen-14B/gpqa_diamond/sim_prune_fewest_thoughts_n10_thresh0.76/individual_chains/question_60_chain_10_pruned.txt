Okay, so I've got this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says that an alien civilization is sending a spacecraft at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years, so I guess that's about how long they live on average.

Wait, the problem is about time dilation, right? Because when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down for the traveler compared to someone watching from Earth. So, the astronaut's own experienced time (proper time) will be less than the time measured from Earth.

I remember the time dilation formula is based on special relativity. The formula is tau equals t multiplied by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), where tau is the proper time (the astronaut's time), t is the time measured in the Earth's frame, and v is the speed.

But wait, the problem gives the speed as 0.99999987*c. That's super close to the speed of light. So the gamma factor (which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) must be really high. Gamma is the factor by which time dilates for the Earth observer compared to the astronaut.

Wait, no, gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So from the Earth's frame, the spaceship's clock runs slower. But from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving, so their time is what's dilated. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

In the Earth frame, the spaceship is moving, so the astronaut ages slower. So if I calculate the time it takes for the trip from Earth's perspective, then multiply by gamma to get the astronaut's time? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Wait. Let me think again. Suppose the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is D. From Earth's frame, the spaceship is moving at speed v, so the time t_earth is D/(v), the distance divided by speed. But D is the distance in Earth's frame.

But wait, the problem states that the destination is Earth, so the distance is the distance between the two galaxies in Earth's frame. But I don't think the exact distance is given, so perhaps they're assuming it's negligible or the speed is so high that the time is calculated based on the speed and the distance.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so I need to compute the proper time, which is the time experienced on the spaceship. The proper time tau is given by tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time in Earth's frame.

But wait, what's the distance here? The problem doesn't specify the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Earth. Oh wait, maybe it's implied that the distance is such that from Earth's frame, the time taken at speed v is equal to the time we need to compute. But without knowing the distance, perhaps the question is more about how much time passes for the astronaut
