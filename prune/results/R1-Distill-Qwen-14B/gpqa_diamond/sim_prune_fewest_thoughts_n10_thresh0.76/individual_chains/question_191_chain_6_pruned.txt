Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reaction steps. But let's take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (like a -CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2)- something? Or wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C=CH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? No, no. Wait, the substituent is -CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, no, perhaps it's the substituent as CH2–C(CH2)– but I'm getting confused. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is actually the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons? No, that can't be. Oh wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group would be the substituent where the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the substituent is on C2. So, the structure is CH2–C(=CH2)–. So the substituent is CH2 attached to C2, and C1 is double bonded to C2. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2–C(=CH2)–, but wait, that would be an allyl group attached via the middle carbon. So the structure is like CH2–C(=CH2)–, but that doesn't make sense because that would
