Okay, I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. The user created a transgenic mouse with an inducible overexpression construct, including the GADD45G coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and selected for antibiotic resistance, but the protein isn't showing up as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I'm going to analyze it for potential issues. The sequence starts with the ATG (start codon) and proceeds. I'll check for any stop codons (TAG, TGA, TAA) which could prematurely terminate translation.

Let me scan through the sequence. I'll go through the codons by reading three nucleotides at a time.

Starting from the beginning:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC C GGA AAA GCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGT GCC GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT G C TCA C TGC CGG CGT CTA GAG TCA GCC AAA GTC TTA GAC G TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC C AT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA AC CAG TCG GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC AGG AGG CGG GTG CGC C G GCG GAC C TGCA CTG CAT CCT C AT TTT GCA GCC CAA CGA GAC GCC TGG AAG GAT CCC G C C T TGG AGA AGC TCA GC CTG TT TTG C GAG GAG AGC CGA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. It's the plus strand, so the coding sequence is read as mRNA would be, which is the same as the given DNA (since the plasmid's coding strand is the same as mRNA). But wait, actually, for a coding sequence, the DNA is usually in the same direction as the mRNA, so the provided sequence is the coding (sense) strand.

Now, looking for stop codons. The first codon is ATG, which is start. Then TAC is tyrosine. Next is CCA (proline), TAC (tyr), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (aspartic acid), TAC (tyr), GCC (alanine), AAA (lysine), TGA (stop codon? TGA is a stop codon). Oh, here we go. The sequence has TGA at position: Let me count.

Looking at the sequence, the first part is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ...

So the codons are:

ATG (start)
TAC
CCA
TAC
GAT
GTT
CCA
GAT
TAC
GCC
AAA
TGA (stop here)

So, after the start codon, the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. That means the protein would terminate right after the 12th amino acid, because TGA is a stop signal. So the construct is introducing a premature stop
