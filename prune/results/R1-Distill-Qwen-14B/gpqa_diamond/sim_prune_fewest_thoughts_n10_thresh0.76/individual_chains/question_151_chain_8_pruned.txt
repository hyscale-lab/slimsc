Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting a value of 0 at time t.

Wait, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the state is a vector in a Hilbert space. So this would be a three-dimensional vector, maybe in a 3-level system or something like that. I should probably normalize it first because the probabilities depend on the vector's length.

Wait, normalization. To normalize a state vector, I need to make sure that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components equals 1. So let's compute the norm of this vector. The components are -1, 2, and 1.

Calculating the norm squared: (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector would be each component divided by sqrt(6). But wait, the question is about calculating probabilities, not necessarily using the normalized vector. Hmm, maybe it's important because probabilities depend on the inner product.

Wait, the observable P is given as a matrix. Let me write it down. The matrix P has rows as follows:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Wait, let me represent that properly. So P is a 3x3 matrix:

P = [
 [0, 1/√2, 0],
 [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
 [0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I think. Now, in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators, right? So I should check if P is Hermitian. Let's see, the (i,j) element equals the complex conjugate of the (j,i) element. Looking at P, all the elements are real, so their complex conjugates are themselves. Let's check the elements. The (1,2) element is 1/√2. The (2,1) is also 1/√2. Similarly, (1,3) is 0, (3,1) is 0. (2,3) is 1/√2, (3,2) is 1/√2. So yes, P is Hermitian. That checks out.

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0 when we measure P. I remember that for an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Then, 0 must be one of them. Because if 0 is an eigenvalue, the probability is non-zero. Otherwise, it would be zero.

So, let me find the eigenvalues of P. Hmm, solving the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

The determinant would be:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, maybe expanding the determinant by the first row. Let me write the determinant as:

| P - λ I | = -λ * det( (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ) - (1/√2) * det( (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ) + 0 * something.

Wait, actually, the determinant is calculated as:

= -λ * [
