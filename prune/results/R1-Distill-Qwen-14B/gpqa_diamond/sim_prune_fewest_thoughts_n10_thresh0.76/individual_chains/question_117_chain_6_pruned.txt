Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with molecules being chiral, right? Chiral molecules have non-superimposable mirror images, which makes them capable of rotating plane-polarized light. So, the question is asking which of the given organic compounds can exhibit optical isomerism.

The question lists four compounds, and the options are combinations of these. Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyls are two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and at 6 and 6' on the other ring. So, on each benzene ring, there are nitro groups and carboxylate ester groups. Now, can this compound have stereoisomerism? Well, biphenyl structures can sometimes have axial chirality, but that depends on the substituents. In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, maybe it can have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents create a chiral axis, then it can have enantiomers. Oh wait, axial chirality occurs when the central axis is a carbon chain, but here it's a single bond between two aryl groups, which is more rigid. Hmm, wait, biphenyls can have two possible configurations: ortho, meta, para, but in terms of axial chirality, I think it's when the substituents are arranged so that the central bond is a chiral axis. Let me thinkâ€”if the substituents on each benzene ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral. So, in 6,6' dinitro and 2,2' di something, maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that creates a chiral center or a chiral axis. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in mirror-image positions, maybe the whole molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: are there any stereogenic centers
