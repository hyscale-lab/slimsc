Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about. 

The question involves two reactions where a chemist used two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds. The products from both reactions are given as (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. I need to determine the starting materials A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in acidic conditions, and BH3 is another reducing agent, often under different conditions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, BH3 is typically used in the formation of alkenes from ketones via the hydroboration reaction. Oh wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh right, when you have a ketone and you use BH3 followed by H+, it's for hydroboration-oxidation, which gives alkenes with anti-Markovnikov orientation. But wait, in this case, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone. So maybe it's a ring-opening or forming reaction.

Wait, another thought: the product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one. That structure is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Or perhaps it's a result of a ring-forming reaction. Oh! Maybe these are examples of the reduction of cyclic ketones. Wait, no. Wait, if the product is tetrahydro pyran-2-one, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether or ester that upon reduction forms this.

Alternatively, maybe the reactions are involving the reduction of some kind of carbonyl group. Let me think: LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters, right? Because esters have a carbonyl group. Wait, esters can be reduced by LiBH4, but they typically require more vigorous conditions. Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Tetrahydro pyran is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen. So the structure would be like an oxane
