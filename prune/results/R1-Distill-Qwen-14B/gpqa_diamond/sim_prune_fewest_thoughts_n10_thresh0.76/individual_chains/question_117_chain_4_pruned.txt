Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. The options are four compounds numbered 1 to 4, and the answer choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism means. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to enantiomers. These are compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. So, for a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must have at least one chiral center or some other form of asymmetry that allows for enantiomers.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Hmm, I'm picturing the structure. So, it's a biphenyl group with substituents on each ring. The biphenyl is connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each phenyl ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Let me try to visualize: each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester group at position 2. So, both rings have similar substituents but on opposite sides.

Wait, but the substituents are on opposite positions. The 6 and 2 positions are on opposite ends of the benzene ring. So, when you have two substituents on each ring, does that lead to any kind of stereochemistry?

Wait, the biphenyl itself might have some kind of stereoisomerism. Biphenyls can have different conformations, but for them to have stereoisomerism, they need to have restricted rotation around the central bond. So, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that they can't rotate into a plane that makes them identical, then they could have geometric isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the phenyl rings create a chiral center. But wait, the phenyl rings are carbon rings; each substituent is attached to a carbon in the ring. So, unless the substituent itself is a chiral center, perhaps the entire molecule isn
