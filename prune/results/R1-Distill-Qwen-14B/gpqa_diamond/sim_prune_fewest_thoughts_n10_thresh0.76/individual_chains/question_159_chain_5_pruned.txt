Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The problem states that there's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but I remember that when the flux drops in certain wavelengths, it could be due to something called the Lyman limit or maybe the Lyman-alpha forest. 

Wait, the Lyman limit is around 91 nm, right? So if the peak is at 790 nm, that's longer than the Lyman limit. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe this has to do with redshift. Because if the quasar's light is being redshifted, then features that are in the UV could shift into the optical or infrared. 

So if the peak is at 790 nm, which is near infrared, perhaps this is the Lyman-alpha emission line. The Lyman-alpha line is at about 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If it's observed at 790 nm, that would imply a redshift z. So using the formula observed wavelength = rest wavelength * (1 + z). 

Let me calculate z. So 790 nm is observed. Rest is 121.6 nm. So 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.499. So (1 + z) is about 6.5. So z is approximately 5.5. Wait, wait, 121.6 * 6.5 is about 790.4. Yes, that makes sense. So the quasar has a redshift z ≈5.5.

Now the question is about the comoving distance of this quasar from Earth. The comoving distance is a function of the redshift and the cosmological parameters given. The universe is flat (Omega_k=0), with matter density parameter Omega_m=0.3 and dark energy (Omega_lambda)=0.7. Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

Comoving distance D_C is calculated using the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). 

But wait, I think the comoving distance formula for a flat universe is D_C = (c/H0) * integral(0 to z) dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda*(1+z)^0). Because dark energy's equation of state is assumed to be w=-1, so it scales as a^-3(1+w)=a^0.

So for z=5.5, I need to compute this integral. But I'm not exactly sure how to compute it exactly. Maybe I can use an approximation or look for known values. Alternatively, I might remember that for high redshifts, the comoving distance can reach several gigaparsecs.

Given the current cosmology (H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7), the comoving distance for z=5.5 can be approximated. I remember that for z around 1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc, but for z=5
