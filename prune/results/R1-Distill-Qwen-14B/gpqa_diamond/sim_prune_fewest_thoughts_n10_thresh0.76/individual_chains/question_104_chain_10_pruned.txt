Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

So the question says that two stars have the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets. The shift in the spectral lines is given for each star. Planet #1's host has a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2's is 7. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1's.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift. The star moves due to the planet's orbit, right? So the velocity of the star is what causes the shift in the spectral lines. The formula I remember is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K, which relates to the planet's mass and the system's configuration. 

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/ ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) Hmm, wait, maybe I should look for the simplified version. Oh right, when the planet mass is much smaller than the star, which it is (Neptune is much less than Sun-like star), so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I recall is K = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/ (2π)) ) Wait, that's a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to use the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude which is K = ( (27 * pi) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between the velocity shift and the orbital period. Since the velocity shift is inversely related to the period? Or is it directly related?

Another approach: The RV method tells us that the star's velocity (semi-amplitude) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think about Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that the orbital period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, divided by the sum of the masses. Since the masses are the same for both stars and the planet masses are negligible, the semi-major axis is proportional to (P^2)^(1/3) → P^(2/3). 

But wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula
