Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are all propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

First, I need to recall what the structures of these compounds look like. Acetates generally have an ester group, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, actually, acetates are usually R-O-CO-R, where one R is an acetyl group. Wait, no, more accurately, the ester is formed from acetic acid and an alcohol. So, for example, propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, that's not right. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2 with the double bond somewhere. Wait, perhaps it's CH3COOCH2CH=CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2 with a double bond in the propenyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Propenyl means a three-carbon chain with a double bond. So propenyl groups can be either cis or trans, but propene itself is CH2=CHCH3. Wait, wait, but propenyl as an substituent would be like CH2=CHCH2- as the ester's R group. Similarly, butenyl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond. So butenyl could be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH2CH2CH=CH2, depending on where the double bond is. But let's think about the structures of the options.

Wait, the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate. So, for propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), and for butenyl, perhaps between 1 and 2 (CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc) or 2 and 3 (CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc). But for the cis and trans designations, it depends on the configuration around the double bond. But in esters, the substituents on the double bond would be the propenyl or butenyl group attached to the oxygen.

Wait, no, the ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. So, for propenyl acetate, R would be CH2CH2CH2, but wait, that's not right. Let me try to draw this mentally.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, connecting the R-O- part to the acetyl. So for propenyl acetate, the R group is CH2
