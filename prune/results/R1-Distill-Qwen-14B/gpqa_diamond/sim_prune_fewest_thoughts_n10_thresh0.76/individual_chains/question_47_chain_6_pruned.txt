Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I need to identify a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR data. Let's see what I can figure out step by step.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to understand the structure a bit. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m -x -y)/2. Plugging in the numbers: n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1. So (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2 =3. So 3 degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, or one ring and two double bonds, or other combinations. But considering the options, probably one aromatic ring (which accounts for 4 degrees, but wait, no, because benzene is three double bonds, so that's 4? Wait, no, each ring or double bond is a degree. A benzene ring has three double bonds, so that's 3 degrees. Wait, wait, the formula is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. For benzene, C6H6: (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14-6)/2=4. So each ring or double bond is one degree. So in our case, 3 degrees: maybe a benzene ring (3) plus another double bond or ring. Hmm. But looking at the options, all seem to have a benzene ring. So the rest of the structure probably has a double bond or an ester group.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are broad signals, which often indicate N-H or O-H stretching. But wait, the options have amide, formamide, aminobenzoate, etc. Let's think. Amides have strong N-H stretches, usually around 3300-3500, and they can be broad. But formamide would also have N-H. However, looking at the 1720 cm-1 peak: that's a strong band, which likely corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So probably an ester, amide, or formamide. Let's think about the options.

The options are:
A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

So all except C have ester or amide groups. Option C is a propionate, which is an ester. Let's think about each.

Now, looking at the NMR. Let me write down the signals:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group (ethyl group) attached to something that splits into a triplet. So probably an ethyl group connected to an oxygen or nitrogen.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Could be an NCH2 or OCH2. Wait, in the case of an ester, maybe OCH2, but in an amide, perhaps NH2 attached to something. Or maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, but why is it a broad signal? Maybe NH adjacent, but NH protons are usually broad. Alternatively, if it's an ethyl group attached to something else, but the triplet at 1.2 suggests the ethyl is in the CH2CH3 arrangement.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, 2H. Quadruplet usually comes from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Wait, in an ethyl ester, the structure is O-CO-OCH2CH3.
