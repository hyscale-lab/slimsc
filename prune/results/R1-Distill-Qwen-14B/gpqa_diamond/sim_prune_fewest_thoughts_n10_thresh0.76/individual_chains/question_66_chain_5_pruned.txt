Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare Symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, right? These operators are classified by their dimension, and they must respect the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, do they have to respect all the SM symmetries, or can some be broken? Because the SM itself has certain symmetries, like gauge symmetries and some global ones.

So, the SM respects Lorentz symmetry because all the particles are described by Lorentz-invariant fields. Operators in SMEFT should maintain that. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a yes.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). The SM is Poincare-invariant, so the SMEFT operators must also respect it. So option 2 (Poincare) is a yes as well. So that's points 1 and 2, which would mean options A (1,2) or C (1,2,4) could be possible.

Wait, but Poincare is a bigger symmetry group than Lorentz. So
