Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. Hmm, let's see. The problem goes through a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone.

First, cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. I think when ketones react with bromine, it's a halogenation reaction. Oh wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. So, bromine (Br2) in a reaction with ketones usually leads to the formation of a dibromide. Wait, but wait, how does that happen? Oh right, ketones can undergo a halogenation via the enol mechanism. So, the enol attacks Br2, leading to the addition of two bromine atoms across the carbonyl. But wait, for cyclohexanone, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromo-cyclohexane? Or wait, no, when you add Br2 to a carbonyl, it forms a dihalide. So, cyclohexanone (which is a six-membered ring with a ketone) would become 1,2-dibromocyclohexane after the reaction. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Or wait, maybe it's the cyclohexane with two adjacent Br atoms. So, that's product 1.

Next, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2. Sodium hydroxide is
