Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and jot down the key points.

So the problem is about heating an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total mass is 7.20 grams, and they're heated to 200°C without air. When they're heated, a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are then passed through several tubes.

The setup of the tubes is as follows:
1. Tube №1 contains anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Its weight increased by 3.60 g.
2. Tube №2 has Ca(OH)2 solution, and there was no change in weight.
3. Tube №3 has red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80 g. Also, CuO is formed here.

After these tubes, only 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, when salts A and B are heated, they probably decompose. The gases that form are likely to be some combination of common decomposition products. Since Mg(ClO4)2 is in tube 1, which is a drying agent, but in this case, it gained weight. That suggests that the gas that passed through tube 1 must have some water in it because Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and would absorb water, increasing the tube's weight. So the gas leaving tube 1 must have had water vapor.

Wait, but wait. Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so when it absorbs water, it would form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, right? So the increase in weight of 3.60 g is the mass of water absorbed.

So the water comes from the decomposition of the salts. So maybe A and B decompose to produce H2O and some other gases.

But then, the gas goes into tube 2, which is Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight didn't change, meaning that the gas didn't react with it. If the gas had CO2, for example, it would be absorbed by Ca(OH)2, causing the tube to gain weight. But since there's no change, maybe the gas doesn't contain CO2. Or perhaps all the CO2 was already absorbed in tube 1? Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 isn't a solution; it's a solid. So perhaps tube 2's solution didn't react because the gas didn't have any acid gases or CO2.

Then, the gas goes into tube 3, which has red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. So the gas that reacted here must have been something that can react with copper. Red-hot copper can react with certain gases. For example, CO would react to form CO2 and Cu. Alternatively, H2 can react with copper at high temperatures, but I think H2 usually requires catalysts or specific conditions. Wait, wait, but another possibility is that SO2 or some other gas reacts, but I think SO2 might not react directly with copper unless under certain conditions.

Wait, but when copper is hot, it can react with CO to form CuO. Let me think: The reaction is 2 Cu(s) + CO(g) → 2 CuO(s) + C(s) (graphite). So the CO would be consumed, and the copper would become CuO. Alternatively, maybe it's reacting with another gas, but CO seems more likely.

Alternatively, could it be another gas like H2? Let's see: H2 and Cu at high temps usually don't react unless a catalyst is present. So perhaps it's CO.

So from tube
