Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. It's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, using reagent A, to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second reaction uses reagent B with H2O to convert 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, like NaCN, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, normally, ketones react with HCN under certain conditions. Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, HCN adds to the carbonyl group. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe the reaction is between the ketone and CN-.

Wait, but to get the nitrile group added, I think it's a substitution. Or perhaps the cyanide is acting as a nucleophile. So butan-2-one has a carbonyl group. When it reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's adding the CN- to the carbonyl carbon, but then what?

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN... Oh, wait, in a typical scenario, the ketone would react with HCN in an acid-catalyzed addition. But if we use a base or a different condition, maybe substitution occurs. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the ketone is converted into a nitrile.

Wait, another thought. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So looking at the structure, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. After reaction, it's (CH3)2C(OH)CNCH2CH3? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but wait, butanenitrile would be four carbons with the nitrile. Wait, wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be: the nitrile is on carbon 1, then a CH2, then a carbon with two methyl groups and a hydroxyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

NC-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)2?

No, butane has four carbons. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, no. Let me think. Butanenitrile would be CH3CH2CH2CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butanenitrile would have four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. So the structure would be:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me number the carbons. Butane is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no. Butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, that can't be right; the nitrile is a functional group at the end. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, no, wait, the nitrile is -CN. So butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. So four carbons in a row, the last being CN.

But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So position 2 has a hydroxyl and a methyl group, and position 4 is the nitrile. Structure would be:

CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. Wait, but that would be four carbons. Let me see: the nitrile is on C4, then C3 is CH2, C2 is C(OH)(CH3), and C1 is CH2. Wait, but that's five carbons. No, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me write it out.

Butanenitrile is R-CN where R is a three-carbon chain. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, that's four carbons, including the nitrile. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CN, which is correct.

But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be:

(CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but that's four carbons? Let's see:

C1: CN
C2: CH2
C3: C(OH)(CH3)
C4: CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The nitrile is on the first carbon (C1), then C2 is CH2, C3 is C(OH)(CH3), and C4 is CH3? No, that would make it five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. 

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. But that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is:

CH2CN-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)2?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanism. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN⁻, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but the product is a nitrile. How does a ketone become a nitrile? Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by CN.

Wait, but another possibility is that the ketone is converted into an alcohol first, but that doesn't seem to fit here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin.

Ah! Yes, cyanohydrin formation. That's when a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN-) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cyanohydrin. The product is a geminal diol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, but butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that sounds like a cyanohydrin. So the reaction is adding HCN to the ketone, but since it's NaCN, perhaps it's under acidic conditions.

So the general reaction is: ketone + HCN → cyanohydrin. But to get HCN from NaCN, you need an acid. So reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B). So in the first reaction, A is H3O+.

So the first part's reagent A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So what's happening here? The nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

How do nitriles become carboxylic acids? One method is hydrolysis. Under acidic or basic conditions. Common reagents are H2O with HCl (like H3O+ and HCl) or under basic conditions like with aqueous KOH.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. For that, acidic or basic conditions are required.

In acidic conditions, the nitrile is hydrolyzed with H2O in the presence of an acid like HCl. For example, HCl and water. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might use a strong base and then acidify.

So the reagent B is likely HCl (H3O+ and HCl as in option A or C) or perhaps another acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C have H3O+ and NaHSO3 as reagent A, and for B, options are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, in the second reaction, reagent B is H2O and something else. So the reagents are H2O and B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So what's the typical condition for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid? Usually, HCl in water (acidic hydrolysis) is used. So reagent B would be HCl (HCl is a strong acid, so perhaps the reaction is done under HCl in H2O).

Alternatively, another option is using a mineral acid, like H2SO4, but in the options, the relevant reagents are B being HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, can you use acetic acid as a catalyst for this hydrolysis? I'm not sure if that's common. I think nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acids typically uses HCl, so B would be HCl, which is option A or C.

Looking back, for the first reaction, reagent A must be acid (H3O+ or NaHSO3). Wait, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-. Would that act as an acid catalyst?

Wait, but for the cyanohydrin formation, you typically need an acid catalyst like H2SO4 or H3O+ (from HCl or H2SO4). So in option A, reagent A is H3O+, which fits. In option C, it's NaHSO3, which may not be the usual catalyst, unless it's acting as a source of H+.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which requires an acid. So if A is H3O+, that's correct. So options A and B (for A) either have H3O+ or NaHSO3.

So for the first reaction, correct A is H3O+ (so options A or B). Then, for the second reaction, correct B is HCl (as in option A or C).

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → possible.

Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. Hmm, if B is CH3COOH, then the second reaction would use acetic acid as the acid. But for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, usually strong acid is needed, not weak. Because HCN is weakly acidic, but to hydrolyze nitrile to acid, strong acid or base is used.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the second reaction is a hydrolysis under basic conditions, but then acid is added to protonate. Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is using a nitrile hydrolysis with H2O and HCl (acid).

So, if reagent B is HCl, then the second reaction is done under acidic conditions, which would be correct for converting nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So, in that case, option A would have A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which would be correct.

Wait, what about option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. With NaHSO3 as A, that's a milder acid. But for the first reaction, which requires acid for the cyanohydrin, would NaHSO3 work? I'm not sure. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and sulfite ions. It's a weaker acid than H3O+, but maybe it's sufficient for the reaction. But I'm more confident that H3O+ is the correct catalyst for the first step.

So, for the first reaction, A should be H3O+ (so options A or B). For the second reaction, B should be HCl (so options A or C). Combining these, the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but what about option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH. That doesn't fit because B would need to be HCl, not acetic acid.

So, the correct answer is option A.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile using reagent A. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with CN⁻ (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst. Acidic conditions are essential for this reaction, and the most suitable reagent for this purpose is H₃O⁺. Therefore, reagent A must be H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid using reagent B. This is a nitrile hydrolysis reaction, where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). For this transformation, acidic hydrolysis is typically employed, and the most appropriate reagent is HCl. Therefore, reagent B must be HCl.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B is not suitable for nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not a strong enough acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation in the first reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both A and B are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
