Okay, so I have this question about Symmetry-Motivated Effective Field Theory, SMEFT, and which symmetries must be respected by all operators. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The options are combinations of these. I remember that in any relativistic quantum field theory, certain symmetries are fundamental. 

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance of the laws of physics under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations, so it includes the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. Oh right, because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations, so if you have Poincare, Lorentz is already included. But I'm not sure which is a subset of the other. Wait, Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare, right? So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz.

Wait the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators, respecting certain symmetries.

I think that all operators in SMEFT must respect the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, but that's not one of the options here. The question is about other symmetries.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries are "respect" by the operators. So which of these four must each operator preserve.

Lorentz symmetry: Operators in SMEFT are constructed respecting the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. So they have to be Lorentz invariant. Because the SM itself is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory extending it. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Poincare symmetry: Well, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But in effective theories, sometimes you break translational invariance when you include terms like the Weinberg operator (which has two derivatives and two Higgs fields). Wait, the Weinberg operator is dimension six and breaks Lorentz symmetry? No, wait, the Weinberg operator is (Hâ€  H)^2 / Lambda^2, which is scalar, so it's Lorentz invariant. Hmm, maybe operators in SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry. Or is that not the case?

Wait, no. SMEFT operators are typically constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. So if the SM respects Poincare, then the operators should too. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT operators are only required to respect Lorentz symmetry because they are written in terms of SM fields, which are already Poincare-invariant. Or perhaps Poincare isn't a separate condition because Lorentz is a subset.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if Poincare is not a separate symmetry but includes Lorentz and translation, but in SMEFT, operators are local, so they must respect Poincare. Or maybe they only have to respect Lorentz.

Alternatively, perhaps all SMEFT operators must be Poincare invariant because they're part of a relativistic theory. So both Lorentz and
