Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, there's spectroscopic data showing radial velocity (RV) variations. The amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We consider the total mass of each system as the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity curves can tell us about the masses of the stars. The more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity amplitude because it's moving less around the center of mass. Oh right, that's because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so its velocity is lower, whereas the less massive star moves faster.

The formula that relates the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the mass ratio comes into play here. The mass ratio q is the mass of the secondary over the primary. From what I recall, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. So K1/K2 = (M2)/(M1), where K is the velocity amplitude and M is the mass. Because the more massive star has a smaller K.

Wait, actually, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by K = ( (2Ï€G) / (P) )^(1/3) * ( (M_companion) ) / ( (M_total)^(2/3) (1 + q)^2 ) ), but I think I'm mixing up some terms here. Alternatively, I remember that the ratio of the velocities (K1/K2) is equal to (M2)/(M1). Because the more massive star (M1) has a smaller velocity, so K1 is smaller than K2 if M2 is smaller. Wait, no, let me think again.

In a binary system, both stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star (M1) will have a smaller orbit, so its velocity (K1) will be smaller. The less massive star (M2) has a larger orbit and higher velocity (K2). So the mass ratio q = M2/M1. The velocity ratio K1/K2 should be equal to M2/(M1 * (1 + q)^something). Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe another approach.

Each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass because they orbit the same center of mass. So K1 is proportional to M2/(M1 + M2) multiplied by some factors, but perhaps for comparing two systems, the periods and velocity amplitudes can help.

Wait, the period is the same for both stars in the system, right? Because they're orbiting each other. The period P is the same for both stars in a binary system. So the period for system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year.

The total mass of the system is M_total = M1
