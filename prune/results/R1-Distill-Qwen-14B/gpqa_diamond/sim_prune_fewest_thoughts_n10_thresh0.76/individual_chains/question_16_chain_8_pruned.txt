Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4. Hmm. I remember that a compound is optically active if it has a chiral center, meaning it has four different substituents attached to a carbon atom. Also, meso compounds are not optically active because they have an internal plane of symmetry, canceling out the chirality.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, this is a double bond. The configuration is Z, but does that affect optical activity? I think geometric isomerism (like E/Z) doesn't create chirality by itself. Unless there's a stereocenter. Let's look at the structure. The molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, butene is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with a Cl on C1 and a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH3))-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. The but-1-ene part is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would mean Cl on the first carbon, which is the same as the double bond. So structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH3))-CH2CH3. Wait, no, the 2-methyl would be on the second carbon, which is the same as the double bond. So the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is connected via double bond to C2 (which has a methyl group). So the structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH3))-CH2CH3? Or is it CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? No, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first CH2. Hmm, maybe I'm
