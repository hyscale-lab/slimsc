Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Let me try to think it through. Hmm, the problem says that a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles of each charge, A+ and A-. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, so maybe we can assume that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy? Or perhaps not, but I'm not sure yet.

The given data is m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. So their combined rest mass energy would be 2 * m_p c². But I don't remember the exact value of m_p c². Wait, I think a proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², so 2 * 938 is about 1876 MeV. But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, wait, no—is it stationary? Or just moving with non-relativistic speed? Hmm, the problem says "slowly moving," which probably means that we can approximate it as non-relativistic, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the process is annihilation, so energy and momentum must be conserved. Let me think about the initial and final states.

The initial system: proton (p) and antipro
