Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and ions, which I remember a little from my classes but I'm not super confident. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So, in a solution containing both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, this is a buffer solution. Buffer solutions use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, right? So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates pH to the ratio of the concentrations of a base and its conjugate acid.

Wait, let me get the ions straight. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4·2H2O), but when dissolved, I think it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These are a conjugate acid-base pair. H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, right? So, H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate a proton), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the dissociation steps. H3PO4 (phosphoric acid) can donate three protons:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, each step has a much smaller Ka, which means each successive deprotonation is harder. Now, the solution has H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So these two are the acid and conjugate base for the second dissociation step. 

Wait, but I'm supposed to find orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-. So is PO4^3- present in the solution? Or is the solution a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which would affect PO4^3- concentration indirectly?

Wait, because HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3-. So if I have HPO4^2- in solution, it can dissociate further to give PO4^3- and H+. But since the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because the third dissociation has a very small Ka (1.8e-12), which is much smaller than Ka2. So PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, so perhaps we can model it using another Henderson equation, but maybe the concentration is negligible compared to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question directly asks for the concentration of
