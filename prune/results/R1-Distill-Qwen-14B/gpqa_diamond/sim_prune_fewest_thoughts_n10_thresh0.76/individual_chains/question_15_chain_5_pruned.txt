Okay, so I've got this question about which planet is more likely to transit, and I need to figure out which one the researchers should observe. Hmm, let's break down the information given.

Both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, then Planet_1's is P/3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 takes, say, 100 days, Planet_1 takes about 33 days. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because it has a shorter orbital period.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Oh, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So higher mass but same radius—maybe it's a subgiant or main-sequence star? I'm not sure, but the radius is what matters for the transit probability.

So, the transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2, but wait, no—that's the depth of the transit. The probability of a transit happening is more about the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Wait, I think the probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star) / a. Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_star) divided by (a * (1 - e)), where e is the eccentricity. But since both planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so it's (R_star)/a. So the probability is higher when the star is larger (relative to the orbit) or the planet's orbit is smaller.

Wait, no—wait, the probability actually depends on the alignment. The planet must pass in front of the star from our perspective. The probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a *
