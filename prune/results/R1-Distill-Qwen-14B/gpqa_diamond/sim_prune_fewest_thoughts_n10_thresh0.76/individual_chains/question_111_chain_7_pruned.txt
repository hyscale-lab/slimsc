Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by looking at the question. It's about predicting the major products of two different reactions based on steric hindrance and product stability. The reactions are:

1. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK to give product A.
2. 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and H2O to give product B.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible structures for A and B. I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me sketch that structure mentally. Cyclohexanone has a ketone group. The substituents are at positions 2, 6, and 1. Wait, no, the numbering. Wait, the compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is at position 1 (since it's 1-one). So the cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group at C1. Then, at C2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (because 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl), so wait, no:

Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C1. At C2, there's an ethyl group (from 2-ethyl) and a methyl group (from 2,6-dimethyl). So, C2 has two substituents: ethyl and methyl. Then, at C6, there's a methyl group. So the substituents are at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl), plus the ketone at C1.

So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with the ketone at position 1. Position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl. So, it's a fairly bulky structure.

The reaction is with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK. I'm thinking this is a Claisen condensation or maybe an aldol addition, but wait, t-BuOK is a strong base, so perhaps an aldol reaction. Alternatively, since we have a cyclohexanone, maybe it's a cross-aldol addition or a conjugate addition.

Wait, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. When a ketone reacts with such a compound in basic conditions, it's likely a conjugate addition (Michael addition) or a cross-aldol. But in the case of a ketone and an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the base might deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone, leading to a nucleophilic attack on the alpha,beta-
