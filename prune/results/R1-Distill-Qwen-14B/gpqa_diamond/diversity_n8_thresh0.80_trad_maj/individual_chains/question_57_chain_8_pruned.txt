Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember from my studies that phase shifts are important in scattering theory, especially in partial wave expansions.

Wait, the phase shifts are given as δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4, each in degrees. The problem states to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess that means higher l values beyond l=4 don't contribute. The scattering is elastic, so maybe we're dealing with something like the Molière scattering or maybe it's just a straightforward partial wave analysis.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by the partial wave expansion. The general formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number and the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which would be θ=0 degrees. So cosθ would be 1, and the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l.

So the scattering amplitude becomes f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. But since we're only considering the imaginary part, and e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, so the imaginary part would come from the terms where the product has an imaginary component.

Wait, the imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term. Let me think: each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. So e^{i δ_l} is cos δl + i sin δl. Then, when you multiply by sin δl, each term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δl sin δl + i sin² δl ].

Wait, no, let me re-express each term. The amplitude for each l is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l. Let me compute this: e^{i δ} is cos δ + i sin δ. So (2l+1) (cos δ + i sin δ) * sin δ.

So that becomes (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ].

The imaginary part of this term is (2l+1) sin²
