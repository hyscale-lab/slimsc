Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read through it again to understand what I'm being asked to do.

So the question is about the elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. We have phase shifts given: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67 degrees, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. The rest of the phase shifts are ignored. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the optical theorem comes into play here. The imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is connected to the total cross-section.

Wait, but specifically, I think the formula involves the sum of the phase shifts. Let me recall. There's an expression for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the origin (θ=0) which is (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum of the phase shifts (including δ₀) multiplied by k, where k is the wave number.

Wait, wait, the general formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) [e^{2iδ₀} (something with Legendre polynomials?), but when θ is zero, the direction is along the beam, so the sum simplifies.

Wait, I think that for θ=0, the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by (1/(2ik)) * (sum of δ_l for all l, including δ₀). Because for the forward direction, the sum over the Legendre terms simplifies a lot, maybe to 1. Let me think, I remember that when θ=0, the sum of the Legendre polynomials evaluated at cosθ=1 is just 1 for each term, so the sum over l would just be each term P_l(1) which is 1 when l=0, but for higher l, P_l(1)=1 as well. Wait no, wait, P_l(1) is always 1 for all l, right? Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l.

Wait, but in the expression for the scattering amplitude, f(θ) is given by (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ). So when θ is 0, cosθ=1, and each P_l(1) is 1. So f(θ=0) becomes (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l}.

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So we need to compute Im(f(0)).

Hmm, but wait, there's another approach. The optical theorem says that the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is σ_total = 4π |k| Im(f(0)), where k is the wave number. But wait, maybe I can get Im(f(0)) directly from the phase shifts.

Wait, but in this problem, we're asked to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, so maybe it's more straightforward to use the formula involving the phase shifts.

Wait, I think that the optical theorem tells us that Im(f(0)) is given by (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(δ_l), where δ_l is the l-th phase shift. Oh wait, because when you sum over all l, each term contributes (2l+1) sin(δ_l), because e^{2iδ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l), and when you take the imaginary part, only the sine term contributes. So Im(f(0)) is (1/(2k)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin(δ_l).

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. The amplitude is f(theta) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l (cosθ). So for θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) becomes (1
