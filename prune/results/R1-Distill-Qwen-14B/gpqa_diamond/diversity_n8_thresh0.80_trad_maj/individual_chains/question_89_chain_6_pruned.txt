Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Alright, let's start with the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. KOH is a strong base. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene via the E2 mechanism. Since adamantane has a diamondoid structure, removing the two bromines from adjacent carbons would form a double bond. So, product 1 would be 1,3-diene adamantane? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Wait, no, in adamantane, each carbon is connected to two or three others. Wait, actually, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each carbon in the structure is bonded to three others. So, 1 and 3 are adjacent? I'm a bit fuzzy on the structure. Alternatively, maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a structure where the two bromines are on adjacent bridgehead carbons.

Wait, when KOH is used in elimination, it's typically dehydrohalogenation. So, if we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, causing the elimination of HBr from each adjacent bromine, forming a double bond between the two bridgehead carbons. So product 1 would be an adamantene with a double bond between C1 and C3, making it 1,3-diamantadiene? Or perhaps 1,3-diene adamantane. Alternatively, maybe it's forming a trans double bond because of the structure. But regardless, the key is that product 1 is an
