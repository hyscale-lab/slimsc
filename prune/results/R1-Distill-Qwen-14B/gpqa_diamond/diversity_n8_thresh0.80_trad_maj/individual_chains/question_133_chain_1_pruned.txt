Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 cm³ (which I think is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 (molar mass 136.09 g/mol) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (molar mass 177.99 g/mol). The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The species are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no—wait, orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. But wait, in solution, it can deprotonate. Hmm, but depending on the pH, the predominant form changes.

Wait, the question asks for orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? Or does it refer to HPO4^2-? Wait, no, ortho means the first deprotonated form, which is H2PO4^-.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, can lose a proton to become H2PO4^- (ortho), then HPO4^2- (meta), then PO4^3- (poly). So orthophosphate is H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions. So they want [H2PO4^-]?

Wait, but let me see the problem again. The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. These are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate salts, respectively.

So, when dissolved, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4, so it's HPO4^2-). But wait, the HPO4^2- can either stay as HPO4^2- or deprotonate further or accept a proton to become something else, depending on the solution's pH.

So the solution will have K+ (spectator ion), Na+ (also spectator), H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-, but the question is about orthophosphate, which is H2PO4^-. So the concentration of H2PO4^- in the solution.

Wait, but in solution, the phosphate species can interconvert based on the pH. The pH here is determined by the buffer system formed by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Because we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, this is a buffer solution. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

Wait, because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

So the pKa to use is Ka2, since Ka1 is for H3PO4 losing H+ to become H2PO4^-, and Ka2 is for H2PO4^- losing H+ to become HPO4^2-.

So pKa2 = -log(Ka2) = -log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so log(6.2e-8) is approximately 0.79 -8 = -7.21. So pKa2 is 7.21.

So the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

What's the ratio of [base]/[acid]? The base is HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4) and the acid is H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4).

First, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

The solution has 1.00 g of each salt.

Calculating moles for each:

For KH2PO4: moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me approximate that. 136 g is about 136.09, so 1/136.09 is approximately 0.00735 mol. So 0.00735 mol.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1/178 is roughly 0.005618 mol.

Wait, wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 is about 0.005618 mol. So that's the moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O, which gives 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.
