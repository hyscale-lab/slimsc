Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let's break it down.

First, I'll try to sketch the target molecule. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. The numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me visualize it.

The substituents are:

- Position 1: ethoxy group (OEt). So that's an ether group attached.
- Position 2: tert-butyl group. That's a bulky substituent, (CH2CH3)3C-.
- Position 3: nitro group (NO2). 

Wait, but wait, in benzene, the positions are numbered such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the substituents should be at positions 1, 2, and 3? Or 1, 2, and 4? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering starts with the ethoxy as position 1, then the tert-butyl is position 2, and nitro is position 3. So the substituents are adjacent to each other? Hmm.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so they can't all be adjacent. Wait, let me imagine the structure. Let's say position 1 is ethoxy. Then position 2 is tert-butyl. Position 3 is nitro. So, numbering goes 1, 2, 3, but in a ring, that could form a meta arrangement? Or maybe all substituents are adjacent. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so substituents at 1,2,3 would be in a way that each is next to the other, but that's not possible in a six-membered ring. Oh wait, no. Wait, in benzene, you can't have three substituents all adjacent. Let me think correctly. So, the molecule is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So the substituents are at positions
