Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says that there's a state |alpha> describing an electron, and it's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that the z-component of spin has eigenstates with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. But wait, the operator in question isn't the z-component; the problem is asking about another operator with a specific matrix form.

The operator has elements Aij where Aij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, let me think about what that looks like as a matrix. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, so two states: up and down), the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2 and the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix would be:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Wait, but matrices are usually written with rows and columns. So A12 and A21 are non-zero, and A11 and A22 are zero. That makes sense.

The problem asks for two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator, and the average value of the operator.

Wait, but wait a second. The operator's eigenstates are the states in which a measurement would yield a definite value. So first, I think I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Because the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis (|up> and |down>), but the operator A has its own eigenbasis. To find the probabilities, I should express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, right?

Alternatively, another approach is to find the eigenvectors of operator A, then project |alpha> onto those eigenvectors to get the probabilities.

So first step: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
