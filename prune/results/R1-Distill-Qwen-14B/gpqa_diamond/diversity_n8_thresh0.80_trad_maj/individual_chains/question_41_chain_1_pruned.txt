Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a light beam propagating through glass that's moving at a constant velocity v. The glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light relative to the lab frame, and the options are given.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in different frames. Oh right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is a glass medium, so the speed of light inside the glass is different. Oh wait, no, the medium affects the speed. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. So when the glass is stationary, the light's speed is c/n.

But now the glass is moving. How does that affect the observed speed? Hmm. I think I should consider the frame of the lab and the frame of the glass. Alternatively, maybe use the velocity addition formula from special
