Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question presents two separate reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each. Then, I'll match them to the options provided.

First Reaction:
The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. So, what kind of reaction is this?

Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. I remember that when a ketone is treated with a base and an enolate is formed, it's usually an aldol addition or some kind of conjugate addition. But wait, ethyl acrylate is a good Michael acceptor. Oh right, Michael addition! That's when a nucleophile attacks an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound.

So the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1 (since it's 1-one), so that's position 1. Then, positions 2 and 6 have substituents. Wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or wait, no. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl substituent? Let me think.

Cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. Position 1 is the ketone (O). Then, position 2: ethyl and methyl groups attached? Because it's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So the substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl) and position 6 (methyl). So the ring has substituents at 2 (two groups) and 6 (one group). So the structure looks like:

1

O
Cyclohexane with substituents at 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl).

So, when t-BuOK is used, which is a strong, bulky base, it would deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate can then attack the Michael acceptor, which is ethyl acrylate.

Wait, but ethyl
