Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probability. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, which is why the researchers would choose to observe it.

Wait, transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But how do the other factors like orbital period, star mass, and star radius play into that probability?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula P = R_star / (a_planet * (1 - e^2)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero. So it simplifies to P = R_star / a_planet. But wait, no, I think I got that mixed up. Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

Wait, no, the transit probability formula is actually (R_star / a_planet)^2 multiplied by something else? Or is it just (R_star / a_planet)? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall.

I think the geometric probability that a planet will transit is approximately (R_*/ a)^2, where R_ is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star from our point of view, which is a geometric chance based on the relative sizes and distances.

So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2. But wait, another factor is the orbital inclination. But in the case where we know the planet's mass via the radial velocity method, the inclination is only known in a minimum sense. So the actual inclination could be anywhere, but the probability distribution depends on the geometry.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is actually given by (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by (1 / (1 - e²))^0.5, but since e is zero, it's just R_star / a_planet. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, no, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbit. So it's (π R_*^2) / (π a^2), which simplifies to (R_* / a)^2. So the probability is (R_* / a)^2. So higher when R_* is larger or a is smaller.

But wait, in the question, both stars have the same radius. So R_* is the same for both. Therefore, the probability depends inversely on a squared. So the planet with a smaller a (semi-major axis) will have a higher transit probability.

Wait, but the semi-major axis can be found using Kepler's third law. The orbital period is given, so for the same star mass, a is determined. Because Kepler's third law says (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + m_planet)/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_star + m ≈ M_star.

So, a^3 = (G M_star P^2)/(4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^{1/3}.

Wait, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 / 3.

Oh wait, no, the way it's worded: "the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than that of Planet_2." So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3.

So for Planet_1, a1^3 = (G M1 * (P/3)^2 )/(4 π²) → a1^3 = (G M1 P^2 )/(9 *4 π²) )

For Planet_2, a2^3 = (G M2 * P^2 )/(4 π²) )

So the ratio a1/a2 is cube root( (M1 / M2) * ( (P/3)^2 ) / P^2 ) )

Wait, M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 M2.

So (M1/M2) = 2.

The (P1/P2) is (1/3) as P1 = P2/3. So (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So putting it together, a1^3 = [2 * (1/9)] a2^3.

Wait wait, let me see:

a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 / M2 ) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

Which is (2) * ( (P/3)^2 / P^2 ) ), since P1 = P/3, P2 = P.

So that's 2 * ( (P^2 /9) / P^2 ) ) = 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = 2/9 → a1/a2 = (2/9)^{1/3}.

Calculating that cube root: 2/9 is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222.

So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is smaller than that of Planet_2.

Since a is smaller, the transit probability, which is proportional to (R_* / a)^2, would be higher for Planet_1.

Because R_* is same for both.

Let me compute the ratio of transit probabilities.

P1-transit probability = (R_*/a1)^2

P2-transit probability = (R_*/a2)^2

So the ratio P1/P2 = ( (R_*/a1)^2 ) / ( (R_*/a2)^2 ) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

Since a1 = 0.6 a2, then a2/a1 = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So (1.6667)^2 ≈ 2.7778.

So P1 is approximately 2.78 times higher than P2.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.78. Let me look.

Options are:

A) 2.25 times higher (Planet_2 preferred)

B) 1.5 times higher (Planet_2 preferred)

C) 1.65 times higher (Planet_1 preferred)

D) 2.7 times higher (Planet_1 preferred)

Wait, in my calculation, P1 is about 2.78 times P2. So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by about 2.78 times. So researchers would prefer observing Planet_1 because it's more likely to transit.

Looking at the options, D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability. That seems to match my calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

So a1/a2 = ( ( M1 * (P1^2) ) / ( M2 * (P2^2) ) ) )^{1/3}.

Wait, M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So M1 / M2 = 2, (P1^2)/(P2^2) = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So 2 * (1/9) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^{1/3}.

Cube root of 2 is ~1.26, cube root of 9 is ~2.08.

So 2/9 is ~0.222. Cube root is approximately 0.6 as earlier.

So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Then, the probability for transit is (R_*/a)^2.

So (R_*/a1)^2 = (1/(0.6 a2))^2 = (1/(a2))^2 * 1/(0.36) ≈ 2.777... times (R_*/a2)^2.

So transit probability for Planet_1 is about 2.77 times that of Planet_2.

So the answer should be D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \), where \( R_* \) is the star's radius and \( a \) is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a^2 \). Thus, the planet with the smaller semi-major axis (\( a \)) will have a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* P^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the star's mass and \( P \) is the orbital period, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)), and its host star is twice as massive (\( M_{*,1} = 2 M_{*,2} \)). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{*,1} P_1^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{*,2} P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}.
\]

Taking the cube root, we find:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6 a_2 \). Since the transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_*}{a}\right)^2 \), the ratio of transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.6}\right)^2 \approx 2.78.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers would prefer observing Planet_1.
