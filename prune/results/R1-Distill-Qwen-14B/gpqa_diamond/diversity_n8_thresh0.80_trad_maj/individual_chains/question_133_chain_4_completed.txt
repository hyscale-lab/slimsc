Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all the Ka stuff. But I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) with 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, which probably means we can use standard Ka values. The Ka values given are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12 for H3PO4.

Hmm, I remember that phosphate buffer solutions usually involve H3PO4 and its conjugate bases. The different K values correspond to the different dissociation steps. So, H3PO4 donates a proton to become H2PO4^- (that's the first dissociation), which can donate another to become HPO4^2- (second dissociation), and then PO4^3- (third dissociation).

Wait, the problem is asking for orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? So I need to find [HPO4^2-] in the solution.

The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it probably dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (and the water of crystallization, but that just contributes to the solution's volume, I think).

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton) to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another proton to become PO4^3-.

But the buffer here is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the relevant K value is Ka2. Because H2PO4^- donates a proton to become HPO4^2- via the second dissociation.

Wait, no. Wait, the buffer system here is H2PO4^- (weak acid) and HPO4^2- (its conjugate base). So the correct Ka to use is Ka2, yes.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation comes into play here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

But wait, in this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So the equation will be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the pH. Hmm, so I can't directly use the Henderson equation unless I calculate the pH another way. But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I can find the pH from the given concentrations and the K values?

Alternatively, maybe I can find the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- and then calculate their concentrations using the total concentration.

Wait, but we don't know the pH. Hmm. So maybe I should approach this by considering the amounts of each salt.

Let me calculate the moles of each.

First, for KH2PO4: Mw is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Wait, 136.09 is the molar mass. So 1 gram is about 1/136.09 moles. Let me compute that.

1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol. So approximately 0.007346 mol of H2PO4^-.

Next, Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005609 mol.

Wait, let me compute 1 / 177.99. So 177.99 is about 178, so 1/178 ≈ 0.005618. So around 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

But wait, each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-. So yes, 0.005618 mol.

So in the solution, we have 0.007346 mol of H2PO4^- and 0.005618 mol of HPO4^2-.

The total volume is 0.2 liters, so the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007346 / 0.2 = 0.03673 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005618 / 0.2 = 0.02809 M

Wait, but then I can use the Henderson equation to find the pH, but since we need [HPO4^2-], perhaps that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe the solution is a buffer, and the concentrations are determined by the ratio.

Wait, but wait. Because in solution, H2PO4^- can act as an acid and HPO4^2- can act as a base.

The equilibrium is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+.

So the Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So the equation is Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-]

But I can rearrange this equation to solve for [HPO4^2-]:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Hmm, but I don't know [H+].

Alternatively, if I can find the pH from the buffer, then I can find [H+], and then compute [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the buffer. The Henderson equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We know [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-], so we can compute pH.

So first, calculate pKa2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Wait, let me compute that.

Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Now, the ratio of [base]/[acid] is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.765.

So log(0.765) is approximately log(0.765) ≈ -0.113.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.113) ≈ 7.0946.

So pH is about 7.0946. So [H+] is 10^(-7.0946) ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, 10^(-7.0946) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0946). 10^(-0.0946) is about 0.823. So [H+] ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think again. Since the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the amounts provided, assuming they don't react significantly beyond their initial concentrations. But I'm not certain; perhaps some of the H2PO4^- could deprotonate to HPO4^2- based on the pH.

Wait, but I think that in this case, the concentrations given by the moles divided by the volume are the actual concentrations in the buffer, because the solution is buffered and doesn't shift much. So maybe the initial concentrations are the actual concentrations, and I can directly calculate the [HPO4^2-].

Wait, no. Because the solution is a buffer, the ratio of the concentrations determines the pH, but the actual concentrations are determined by the amount of each salt added. So perhaps the initial concentrations are correct.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. So based on the moles and volume, it's 0.02809 M, but wait, that can't be right because the options are much lower, in the 1e-7 range. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.

The problem states that the solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4•2H2O. So the total volume is 200 cm³=0.2 L.

Wait, but perhaps when these salts dissolve, they contribute to the concentration of phosphate species. But wait, H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are different species. So maybe the total phosphate concentration is the sum of all species, but the question is specifically about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in the solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. The PO4^3- is negligible because Ka3 is much smaller. So perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is what we're after.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, [HPO4^2-] is about 0.02809 M. But the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is way smaller. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I confused the molar masses. Let me double-check the calculations.

Molar mass of KH2PO4: K is about 39.10, H2 is 2, P is 30.97, O4 is 64. So 39.1 + 2 + 30.97 + 64 = 136.07 g/mol, which matches the given Mw of 136.09. So 1g is 1/136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is 22.99 each, so 2*22.99=45.98. HPO4 is 96.97 (H:1, P:31, O4:64). Wait, no, HPO4^2- has 1 H, 1 P, 4 O, so the formula weight is (1)+(30.97)+(16*4) = 1 + 30.97 + 64 = 95.97 g/mol. Then, 2 H2O is 2*(2 +16) = 36. So total Mw is 45.98 + 95.97 + 36 = 177.95 g/mol, which matches the given 177.99 g/mol. So 1 gram is 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005618 mol.

So the moles are correct.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. So the concentration is 0.005618 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02809 M. But that's 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M. But the options are 6e-7, 5e-7, etc. So I'm way off. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, but about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Because that's orthophosphate? No, wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but I think orthophosphate can also refer to the HPO4^2- ion. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Let me think. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate, which is orthophosphate?), and then PO4^3- (phosphate).

Wait, perhaps the question is considering HPO4^2- as orthophosphate, so my initial approach is correct. But the calculation gives a concentration that's way too high compared to the options.

So, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the solution is not just a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but considering their dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, so H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2-:

H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+

The Ka for this is Ka2 = 6.2e-8. So the equilibrium will shift based on the concentrations.

So given that, the problem is more complex. The solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the system is a buffer, and the pH is determined by the ratio of the two.

Wait, but I already calculated the pH using the Henderson equation as approximately 7.09. Then [H+] is about 8.23e-8 M.

So then, using the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange to find [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 = 6.2e-8

[H2PO4^-] is 0.03673 M (from earlier)

[H+] is 8.23e-8 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.03673) / (8.23e-8) 

Let me compute this:

6.2e-8 * 0.03673 = let's see, 6.2 * 0.03673 ≈ 0.2283e-8, which is 2.283e-10.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 2.283e-10 / 8.23e-8 ≈ (2.283 / 8.23) * 1e-2 ≈ 0.2775e-2 = 2.775e-3 M.

Wait, that's about 0.002775 M, which is 2.77e-3 M. But that's still much higher than the options given. The options are all around 1e-7, which is a thousand times smaller. So this approach isn't getting me to the answer.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution does not have significant HPO4^2- ions because H2PO4^- is the dominant species, and HPO4^2- is formed from it. But in that case, the concentration would be much lower.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is highly buffered, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the buffer's capacity. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the concentration using the Ka values and the initial concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the two salts are dissolved, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions, but they can interconvert based on the pH.

Let me think: the total concentration of phosphate species is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-]. But PO4^3- is negligible because Ka3 is so small.

But the problem is only about [HPO4^2-], which is the orthophosphate ion.

Wait, perhaps I should set up an equilibrium expression. Let me denote [H2PO4^-] as a and [HPO4^2-] as b.

But wait, initial concentrations from the salts are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M (from KH2PO4)

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M (from Na2HPO4·2H2O)

Wait, but in the solution, these ions can react with each other.

H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+

So the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M

But at equilibrium, some H2PO4^- will convert to HPO4^2- based on the Ka2.

Let me denote the change as x.

Wait, but perhaps the system is a buffer, and the Henderson equation applies. So using pH = pKa2 + log(b/a), where a is [H2PO4^-] and b is [HPO4^2-].

Wait, but we don't know the pH. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I can find the pH using the concentrations and then find [HPO4^2-].

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratio.

Hmm. Wait, maybe I should calculate the pH of the solution using the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the Henderson equation says pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

So plugging in the numbers:

pKa2 ≈ 7.208

[HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.02809 / 0.03673 ≈ 0.765.

So log(0.765) ≈ -0.113.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.113 ≈ 7.095.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka2 expression: Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange to find [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 =6.2e-8

[H2PO4^-] =0.03673 M

[H+] =8.21e-8 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.03673) / (8.21e-8)

Compute the numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.03673 = 6.2 * 0.03673 ≈ 0.2283e-8 → 2.283e-10.

Divide by denominator: 2.283e-10 / 8.21e-8 = (2.283 / 8.21) * (1e-10 / 1e-8) ) → approximately 0.278 * 1e-2 = 0.00278 M.

Wait, that's 2.78e-3 M, which is 0.00278 M, but the options are much smaller. So this approach isn't matching the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the solution is not a buffer but involves multiple steps. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the solubility of the phosphate ions.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are the same, leading to a certain pH. But that's not the case here; their concentrations are different.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions. For example, HPO4^2- can act as a base, accepting a proton to become H2PO4^-.

Wait, but given that I have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, their equilibrium will determine the pH, and the concentrations will affect each other.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found using the Ka2 and the ratio from the buffer.

Wait, but I already tried that approach, and the numbers didn't match the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial setup.

Wait, looking back, the problem states that the solution contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So perhaps the total phosphate comes from both, but I'm not considering the stoichiometry correctly.

Wait, KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, maybe the problem is not directly about their concentrations but about the concentration of PO4^3- because orthophosphate is considered as PO4^3-?

No, I think orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between ortho- and other phosphate species. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is considering the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but no, PO4^3- is the most deprotonated form, and HPO4^2- is the ortho form.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the dissociation steps again. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons.

But in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are the second and third species.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- as the orthophosphate, and the phosphate ions (PO4^3-) are negligible because of the low K_a3.

So, maybe the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the buffer's pH, and using the initial concentrations and the K_a2.

Wait, perhaps I should find the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- first.

Using the Henderson equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But earlier, I found the pH to be about 7.09, which gives [H+] = 8.21e-8.

Now, the problem is that using the Henderson equation with the given concentrations gives me a pH, but maybe the actual concentrations are affected by this pH.

Wait, but in this case, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are determined by the initial moles, so any shifts due to dissociation would be small, and the concentrations can be considered as initial concentrations. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 M. But that's way higher than the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the concentration in the solution but the solubility of the phosphate salts.

Wait, but both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are soluble in water, so their concentrations are determined by how much is dissolved.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the actual concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

So, in solution, some H2PO4^- will deprotonate to form HPO4^2-.

Let me model this.

Let me denote:

Initial concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 M

At equilibrium, some of H2PO4^- will convert to HPO4^2-.

Let x be the change in H2PO4^- that converts to HPO4^2-.

So, the equilibrium concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 - x

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 + x

[H+] is determined by the water dissociation and the buffer.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Ka expression.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange this to [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 [H2PO4^-])/ [H+]

But [H+] is linked to the pH, which is determined by the buffer.

Wait, but if I substitute [H+] from the Henderson equation, then:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which can be rewritten as:

[HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2)

But [H+] is 10^(-pH).

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Maybe I should substitute [H+] from the pH expression into the Ka equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] using the Henderson equation and then find the concentrations.

Wait, but I already know the ratio from the initial concentrations. Oh wait, but the initial concentrations are after adding the salts, so perhaps the ratio is fixed, and the pH is determined by that ratio.

Hmm, maybe I should stop trying to calculate the [HPO4^2-] directly and think about the problem differently. Perhaps the problem is about the solubility of the salts, but that doesn't make sense because they're both soluble.

Wait, looking back at the options, they're all around 1e-7 M. So maybe the concentration of HPO4^2- is about 1e-7 M. How can that be?

Wait, perhaps the solution is not just the mixture of the two salts but involves the precipitation of some phosphate species. But I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, wait! I think I'm making a mistake in considering the stoichiometry. Let me re-express the problem.

The solution has 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O.

When these salts dissolve, they contribute to the solution's phosphate species.

But perhaps the solution's total phosphate comes from both salts, but in terms of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the concentration of HPO4^2-, which is the orthophosphate ion.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the solution is a buffer and the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found using the ratio from the buffer equation.

Wait, but earlier calculations didn't match the options. So perhaps I should think about the solution as a buffer where the concentrations are adjusted based on the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are in a certain ratio, but the actual concentrations depend on the amounts added.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think about the problem from a different angle.

Another approach: The problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, [HPO4^2-].

In solution, the phosphate exists as H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

But in this case, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The total concentration of phosphate species is the sum of all these.

But perhaps the question is only about the HPO4^2- concentration, which is given by the moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O divided by the volume.

But that gives 0.02809 M, which isn't matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, correct. So moles divided by 0.2 L gives Molarity.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the orthophosphate ion is PO4^3-, not HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, I think ortho refers to the HPO4^2-.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration using the buffer equation and the given Ka values. Let's think:

The buffer equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid])

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But I don't know the pH. But perhaps I can find the pH from the given concentrations.

Wait, but I can't because the pH is what determines the ratio, and the ratio is the initial one.

Wait, perhaps the solution's pH is neutral, around 7, which is the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is not a buffer but a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base, leading to a certain concentration.

Wait, but in this case, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are conjugate acid-base pairs, so the buffer idea is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact concentration using the initial concentrations and the Ka expression.

Wait, let me set up the equation:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

I can express [H+] in terms of the ratio.

Let me denote [HPO4^2-] = x and [H2PO4^-] = y.

But from the moles, x = 0.02809 M and y = 0.03673 M, but they can change based on the dissociation.

Wait, but that's what I tried earlier. So, perhaps the mistake is in not considering that the solution's pH affects the ratio, but I don't know the pH.

Wait, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are adjusted based on that pH.

Wait, but without knowing the pH, I can't proceed. So perhaps I should use the given data to find the pH, then find the [HPO4^2-] using the Henderson equation.

But I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem differently. Maybe the solution is considering the phosphate ions in solution, considering all equilibria.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

So, in solution, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

The reaction is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+

The K for this is Ka2 =6.2e-8.

So, the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 M

But when the solution is made, some H2PO4^- will dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+.

Let me denote the change as x. So,

At equilibrium:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 - x

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02809 + x

[H+] = x (since each dissociation produces one H+)

Wait, but that's only true if x is much smaller than the initial concentrations. Let's test that assumption. Since Ka2 is small (6.2e-8), x should be small.

So, the expression becomes:

Ka2 ≈ x * (0.02809 + x) / (0.03673 - x)

Assuming x is small, 0.02809 + x ≈ 0.02809 and 0.03673 - x ≈ 0.03673.

So,

Ka2 ≈ x * (0.02809) / 0.03673

Solving for x:

x ≈ (Ka2 * 0.03673) / 0.02809

Plugging in Ka2 =6.2e-8:

x ≈ (6.2e-8 * 0.03673) / 0.02809 ≈ (2.283e-9) / 0.02809 ≈ 8.13e-8.

So, [H+] ≈ x =8.13e-8 M.

Now, the equilibrium [HPO4^2-] is 0.02809 + x ≈ 0.02809 + 8.13e-8 ≈ 0.028098 M.

Wait, that's still about 0.028 M, which is way higher than the options. So I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and the [HPO4^2-] is determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, if I plug the initial concentrations into the Henderson equation, I get pH = pKa2 + log(0.02809 / 0.03673) ≈ 7.208 + (-0.113) =7.095.

So, [H+] =10^(-7.095) ≈ 8.21e-8 M.

Now, using this [H+], I can find [HPO4^2-] using the Ka2 expression.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

Rearranged: [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 =6.2e-8

[H2PO4^-] =0.03673 M

[H+] =8.21e-8 M.

So,

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.03673) / 8.21e-8

Compute numerator:6.2e-8 *0.03673= 2.283e-9.

Denominator:8.21e-8.

So,

2.283e-9 /8.21e-8 = (2.283 /8.21) * 1e-1 ≈ 0.278 * 0.1 = 0.0278 M.

Again, this gives 0.0278 M, which is way higher than the options.

Wait, the options are around 1e-7 M. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but how?

Wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-, but if we consider the third dissociation, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is very small, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the solution is considering the concentration of PO4^3- as the orthophosphate ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but that would be even smaller. Let me compute.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

At equilibrium,

[HPO4^2-] =0.02809 M (approx)

[PO4^3-] = x

[H+] =8.21e-8 M (from earlier)

So, Ka3 = (8.21e-8 * x) / 0.02809.

Solving for x:

x = (Ka3 * 0.02809) / 8.21e-8.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So,

x = (1.8e-12 * 0.02809) /8.21e-8 ≈ (5.056e-14)/8.21e-8 ≈ 6.16e-7 M.

Wait, 6.16e-7 M is option A (6.24e-7 M), which is close.

But wait, the problem asks for orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. So why am I calculating PO4^3-?

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps the correct approach is to consider the third dissociation, but I'm confused because orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the [PO4^3-], which is approximately 6e-7 M, matching option A. But that would mean the question is actually about PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering what the question is asking. Let me read again.

The question says, 'the concentration of orthophosphate ions'. Orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-.

So the previous calculation for [HPO4^2-] was 0.0278 M, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem as a simple dissociation of Na2HPO4·2H2O into Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, the concentration of HPO4^2- is moles divided by volume.

Moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005618 mol.

Volume: 0.2 L → 0.005618 / 0.2 =0.02809 M.

But that's 0.028 M, which is not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I've made a mistake in the molar masses.

Wait, let me double-check the molar masses.

KH2PO4: K is 39.10, H2 is 2, P is 30.97, O4 is 64. So sum is 39.10 + 2 +30.97 +64 = 136.07 g/mol. Mw given is 136.09, so correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is 22.99 per atom, so 2×22.99=45.98. HPO4^2- is H(1.008) + P(30.97) + O4(64×16=64?) Wait, no, O is 16×4=64. So HPO4^2- is 1.008 +30.97 +64=96. So the HPO4^2- part is 96 g/mol.

Plus 2H2O: each H2O is 18.015, so 2×18.015=36.03.

So total Mw is 45.98 + 96 +36.03 = 178.01 g/mol. Given as 177.99, which is close enough.

So moles are correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the orthophosphate ion as H3PO4, but that's not the case because H3PO4 is a molecule, not an ion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of PO4^3- due to the third dissociation.

As calculated earlier, [PO4^3-] ≈6.16e-7 M, which is option A (6.24e-7).

But the question asks for orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2-.

Wait, but that would be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, but after considering all dissociation steps, including the third.

Wait, but that doesn't change the concentration much.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the buffer equation, leading to a much lower concentration.

Wait, let me try rearranging the ka equation to solve for [HPO4^2-].

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

But [H+] is 1e-7 (approx), which would make [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.03673) / 1e-7 ≈ (2.283e-9) / 1e-7 = 0.02283 M.

Which is about 2.28e-2 M, which is still higher than the options.

Wait, but if [H+] is 1e-7, then ka2 * [H2PO4^-]/[H+] is 6.2e-8 * 0.03673 / 1e-7 = (6.2e-8 * 0.03673) / 1e-7 = (2.283e-9) / 1e-7 = 0.02283 M.

But the options are 1e-7, so I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fourth dissociation, but H3PO4 only has three protons.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a very weak buffer and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the hydrolysis of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but without more information, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution, considering both salts and the dissociation, but I can't see the right path.

Another thought: perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are same, but no, in this case, they are different.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation.

As above, [PO4^3-] ≈6.16e-7 M, which matches option A.

But the question is about orthophosphate (HPO4^2-), not PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution after considering the common ion effect.

Wait, but I can't see how that would work.

Another angle: perhaps the solution is considering that the phosphate comes from both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, but in reality, they form a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is calculated using the buffer equation.

Wait, but earlier, using the Henderson equation, I calculated [HPO4^2-] as 0.0278 M, which is not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck, and perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the ratio of the two salts.

Wait, but the ratio of moles of Na2HPO4 to KH2PO4 is 0.005618 mol :0.007346 mol ≈0.765.

So the ratio is 0.765, as I calculated earlier. So the pH is pKa2 + log(0.765)=7.208 -0.113=7.095.

Now, using this pH, the [H+] is 8.21e-8.

Now, using Ka2 =6.2e-8= [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

We can solve for [HPO4^2-]:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-])/ [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

(6.2e-8 * 0.03673) /8.21e-8 = (2.283e-9) /8.21e-8= approx 0.0278 M.

Again, same result. So I'm not making progress.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution considering that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but earlier calculations didn't lead to the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D:3.97e-7 M.

But I don't see how to get there.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the concentration using the given K values and the initial moles, considering that the solution is a buffer.

Wait, perhaps the solution is considering that the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the buffer equation and the initial concentrations.

Wait, using the buffer equation:

[HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(pH - pKa2)

We know that pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But I can't proceed without knowing the pH.

Hmm, perhaps I should accept that I'm not getting the correct approach and look for a different method.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of Na2HPO4)/(volume) / (1 + ( [H2PO4^-]/[HPO4^2-] ) )

But that's probably not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is 0.2 L, and the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 are 0.005618 mol, so [HPO4^2-] =0.005618 /0.2 =0.02809 M.

But that's way higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions, which is the fourth dissociation, but H3PO4 can't donate a fourth proton.

I'm really stuck here. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the calculations I did earlier.

Wait, when I calculated [PO4^3-], I got approximately 6e-7 M, which matches option A. So perhaps the question is asking about PO4^3- instead of HPO4^2-.

But the question says 'orthophosphate ions', which I thought were HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- in a different way, considering the third dissociation.

Hmm. I think I'll go with option A:6.24e-7 M, but I'm not entirely sure.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([HPO₄²⁻]) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each salt in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). The relevant dissociation constant is Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸ for the equilibrium:

\[
\text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{HPO₄²⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007346 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Dissociates into 0.007346 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005618 \, \text{mol} \)  
  Dissociates into 0.005618 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Initial concentrations
The total volume is 0.2 L, so:  
\[
[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007346 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.03673 \, \text{M}
\]  
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005618 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} = 0.02809 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation
The buffer system is governed by:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa₂} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
\]  
\[
\text{pKa₂} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log \left( \frac{0.02809}{0.03673} \right)
\]  
\[
\log \left( \frac{0.02809}{0.03673} \right) \approx \log(0.765) \approx -0.113
\]  
\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.208 - 0.113 = 7.095
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [H⁺]
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.095} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Use the Ka₂ expression
\[
\text{Ka₂} = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka₂} \cdot [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
Substitute values:  
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot (0.03673)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{2.283 \times 10^{-9}}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 2.78 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 6: Reassess the problem
The calculated \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}]\) is much higher than the options provided (all ~10⁻⁷ M). This suggests the problem might instead ask for the concentration of PO₄³⁻, the fully deprotonated form, which is negligible but can be calculated using Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²:

\[
\text{Ka₃} = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka₃} \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
Substitute values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02809)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.056 \times 10^{-14}}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

This matches option A. Given the discrepancy, it appears the question may refer to PO₄³⁻ as "orthophosphate," though this is unconventional. Based on the calculations, the closest answer is:

**Answer: A**
