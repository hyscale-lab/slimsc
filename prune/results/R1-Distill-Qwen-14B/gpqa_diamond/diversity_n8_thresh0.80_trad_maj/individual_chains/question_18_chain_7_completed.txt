Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

First, I need to understand the given data. Both stars have masses more than our Sun, but I don't think mass directly affects the abundance ratios here. The important values are the elemental abundances determined using the EW method under LTE.

Looking at the data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the abundance of silicon relative to iron is 0.3 higher than the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. Hmm, [Fe/H] is the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen compared to the Sun. So if it's 0, that means [Fe/H] is the same as the solar value, right? So the iron abundance is the same as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So magnesium is 0.3 dex more abundant relative to silicon than the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So magnesium abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So I need to find [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait, the notation can be tricky. [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or is it [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun? Wait no, [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) − log(nX/nY)_☉. Or wait, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) − (log(nX/nY)_☉). So for the Sun, [X/Y] is 0.

Wait, the question gives for the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → That's log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5-12=−4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^−4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly for Mg: log10(nMg/nH) =7-12=−5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

I think that's correct.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) − log(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So Star_1's Fe/H is same as Sun. So nFe/nH =3.16e-5.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) − log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3. Let me compute nSi/nFe for Star_1.

Wait, [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) − [Si/Fe]_sun. Wait no, the definition is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) − log(nX/nY)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 − log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

So, log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun +0.3.

But the Sun's [Si/Fe] is zero? Wait, no. Wait, the Sun's [X/Y] is zero when X/Y in the star is same as in the Sun. So, for example, [Fe/H]_sun is zero. Wait, but [Si/Fe]_sun is also zero? Because [X/Y] is relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [Si/Fe] is zero. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3. So nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 − log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3. But since [Si/Fe]_sun is zero (because it's the Sun), log(nSi/nFe)_sun is the same as in the Sun. So nSi/nFe for the Sun is, let's compute that.

In the Sun, nFe/nH =3.16e-5. We need nSi/nFe for the sun.

Wait, but I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Wait, in the Sun, [X/Y] is zero for any X and Y. So [Si/Fe]_sun is zero. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 implies that nSi/nFe is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times higher than in the Sun.

Wait, no. Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) − log(nX/nY)_sun. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]=0.3 → log(nSi/nFe) = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^(0.3) * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but what's (nSi/nFe)_sun? Since [Si/Fe]_sun is zero, yes, that's correct. So (nSi/nFe)_sun = 10^([Si/Fe]_sun) = 10^0 =1. So for Star_1, nSi/nFe = 1 * 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

But wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5. So for Star_1, nFe/nH is same as Sun, so 3.16e-5. So nSi = (nSi/nFe) * nFe = (2) * (3.16e-5) =6.32e-5.

Wait, no, wait. nSi/nFe is 2, so nSi = 2 * nFe. But nFe is 3.16e-5, so nSi is 6.32e-5. So [Si/H] for Star_1 is log10(nSi/nH) = log10( (nSi)/(nH) ) = log10( (nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH) ) = log10(2 * (3.16e-5)). Wait, wait, but nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, so nSi/nH = (nSi/nFe) * (nFe/nH) = 2 * 3.16e-5 =6.32e-5.

So log(nSi/nH) = log(6.32e-5) ≈ log(6.32) + log(1e-5) → about 0.8 + (-5) → -4.2.

Wait, but alternatively, the Sun's [Si/H] can be calculated. Let me compute that.

In the Sun: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

But for silicon in the Sun, I don't have a value. Wait, but perhaps we can find [Si/H] for the Sun using [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun is zero, so [Si/H]_sun = [Fe/H]_sun + [Si/Fe]_sun? No, that's not correct. Wait, [X/H] = [X/Fe] + [Fe/H]. Because [X/H] = log(nX/nH) – log(nX/nH)_sun. And [X/Fe] = log(nX/nFe) – log(nX/nFe)_sun.

But since [Fe/H]_sun is zero, because [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun, which is zero. So for any star, [X/H] = [X/Fe] + [Fe/H].

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is zero. So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 +0=0.3.

Similarly, for the Sun, [Si/H]_sun = [Si/Fe]_sun + [Fe/H]_sun =0 +0=0. So [Si/H]_sun =0. So log(nSi/nH)_sun =0 → nSi/nH =1e0 =1.

Wait, but wait. If [Si/H]_sun is 0, then log(nSi/nH)_sun =0 → nSi/nH_sun =1.

But earlier, for the Sun, nFe/nH =3.16e-5. So nFe/nH =3.16e-5.

Wait, but if nSi/nH_sun =1, then nSi = nH_sun. But nFe is 3.16e-5 *nH. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of solar abundances.

Maybe I should compute the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star using the given data.

Let me try that.

For Star 1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → so [Si/Fe] =0.3. And [Fe/H]_1=0 → [Fe/H]=0.

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3 → which means log10(nSi/nH)_1 =0.3 → nSi/nH_1 =10^0.3 ≈2. So nSi_1 =2 * nH_1.

Wait, but for the Sun:

log10(nFe/nH_sun) =-4.5 → nFe/nH_sun =1e-4.5.

Similarly, [Si/H]_sun =0 → log(nSi/nH_sun)=0 → nSi/nH_sun =1e0=1.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]=0.3 → nSi/nH_1 =10^0.3 ≈2.

For Star_2:

We have [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → so [Mg/Si] =0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → [Mg/H]=0.

So [Mg/H]_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + [Si/H]_2 → 0 =0.3 + [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So log10(nSi/nH)_2 =-0.3 → nSi/nH_2 =10^-0.3 ≈0.5.

So for Star_1, nSi_1/nH_1 =2.

For Star_2, nSi_2/nH_2=0.5.

But the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that would be (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) )= (2) / (0.5) )=4.

Wait, but wait, the ratio is Star_1 / Star_2, right? So 2 / 0.5 is 4.

But wait, the options don't have 4. Let me check the options.

Options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm, 4 is close to option A, which is ~3.9. But did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I'm calculating [Si/H]. Let me go back.

Alternative approach: Compute [Si/H] for each star, then take the ratio.

Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun +0.3.

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun +0 → same as Sun. So nFe/nH = same as Sun.

So nFe_1 = nFe_sun.

Thus, for Star_1, nSi_1 =nFe_1 * (nSi/nFe)_1.

But (nSi/nFe)_1 =10^0.3 ≈2.

So nSi_1 = 2 * nFe_sun.

But nFe_sun =3.16e-5 *nH_sun.

Wait, but Star_1's hydrogen might be different? Wait, but when considering ratios, perhaps we can normalize everything to hydrogen.

Wait, let me think for Star_1:

nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (10^{[Fe/H]_1}) ) =nFe_sun *10^0 =nFe_sun.

nSi_1 =nFe_1 *10^{[Si/Fe]_1} =nFe_sun *10^{0.3}.

So [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1 /nH_1) = log( (nFe_sun * 10^{0.3}) ) /nH_1.

But nFe_sun = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_sun = (3.16e-5) *nH_sun.

So nSi_1 =3.16e-5 *10^{0.3} *nH_sun.

So nSi_1 /nH_1 = (3.16e-5 * 10^{0.3}) * (nH_sun /nH_1).

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1 =0 → [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → so nFe/nH =nFe_sun/nH_sun → So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

Thus, nFe_1 = (3.16e-5) *nH_1.

So nSi_1 =2 *nFe_1 =2*(3.16e-5)*nH_1 =6.32e-5 *nH_1.

So [Si/H]_1 = log10(6.32e-5 *nH_1 /nH_1 ) = log10(6.32e-5) ≈ log(6.32) + (-5) ≈0.8 + (-5) =-4.2.

So [Si/H]_1 =-4.2 +12 (since the given Sun's [Fe/H] is 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5, so [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH)- (-4.5) which equals log(nFe/nH)+4.5? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the conventions.

Wait, the [X/H] notation is defined as log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun.

So [X/H] = log10(nX/nH) - (log10(nX/nH_sun)).

So for the Sun, [X/H] is 0 for any X.

Wait, but in the Sun, [Fe/H] is 0, [Si/H] is 0, etc.

So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

We have:

nSi_1 = 2 * nFe_1, and nFe_1 =3.16e-5 *nH_1.

Because [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe/nH = same as Sun, which is 3.16e-5.

Thus, nFe_1 =3.16e-5 *nH_1.

So nSi_1 =2 *3.16e-5 *nH_1 =6.32e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_sun =nSi_sun/nH_sun *nH_sun.

But [Si/H]_sun=0 → log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)=0 → nSi_sun/nH_sun=1 → nSi_sun =nH_sun.

So nSi_sun =nH_sun.

Thus, log(nSi_1/nH_1) =log(6.32e-5) = log(6.32) + log(1e-5) =0.8 + (-5) =-4.2.

log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)=0.

So [Si/H]_1 =-4.2 -0 =-4.2.

Wait, no. Because [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Which is log(6.32e-5) - log(1) → (-4.2) -0 →-4.2.

So [Si/H]_1 =-4.2.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun =0.3.

But [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, so log(nMg/nSi)_2 =0.3 → nMg/nSi=10^0.3≈2.

[Mg/H]_2=0 → log(nMg/nH)_2 = log(nMg/nH)_sun → same as Sun.

In the Sun, nMg/nH=1e-5 (as given), so nMg_2 =1e-5 *nH_2.

But nMg_2 =2 *nSi_2 → because nMg/nSi=2 → nMg =2 *nSi_2.

So 2 *nSi_2 =1e-5 *nH_2 → nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2)/2 =5e-6 *nH_2.

Thus, log(nSi_2/nH_2)=log(5e-6) = log(5) + (-6)≈0.7 + (-6)= -5.3.

But [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) → log(5e-6) -0 →-5.3.

So for Star_1: [Si/H]_1 =-4.2.

Star_2: [Si/H]_2 =-5.3.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the signs earlier. Because [Si/H] is log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun). So for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = log(6.32e-5) - log(1) =-4.2.

For Star_2, [Si/H]_2 = log(5e-6) -0 →-5.3.

But wait, wait, no. Because [Si/H]_2 is the abundance relative to the Sun. So the actual value is:

[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Which would be log(5e-6) - log(1) = log(5e-6) = -5.3.

So now, the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) ?

Wait, no. The ratio of the silicon abundance is (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) )= (nSi_1 /nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2) → [Si/H]_1 is log of (nSi_1 /nH_1) minus log of (nSi_sun /nH_sun), which is same as log( (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 is log( (nSi_2/nH_2) / (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ).

So to find (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ), it's equal to (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2) = (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2/nSi_2) )= ( (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) ) → which is ( (nSi_1/nH_1) ) / (nSi_2/nH_2) )= (nSi_1 / nH_1) * (nH_2 /nSi_2) )= (nSi_1 nH_2) / (nH_1 nSi_2).

But in terms of [X/H], the ratio can be calculated as 10^{ ([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) }.

Because [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_2/nH_2) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi_1/nH_1) - log(nSi_2/nH_2).

Which is log( (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) → so 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } equals (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_2/nH_2) → which is the ratio we need.

So [Si/H]_1 =-4.2, [Si/H]_2=-5.3.

So [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 = (-4.2) - (-5.3) )=1.1.

So the ratio is 10^1.1 →≈12.589.

Which is approximately 12.6. So option B is ~12.6.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 4. Where did I go wrong?

Ah, I think I messed up the [Si/H] calculation when I first approached it. Let me clarify.

Wait, the first approach I was just taking [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2=-0.3, leading to a ratio of 2/0.5=4. But that approach was incorrect because I misunderstood the definitions. The correct way is to compute [Si/H] using the given data, which leads to [Si/H]_1 =-4.2 and [Si/H]_2 =-5.3. The ratio is 10^(1.1)= ~12.6.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given data and use the definitions of elemental abundance ratios.

### Key Definitions and Data:
1. **[X/Y] = log(nX/nY) − log(nX/nY)_☉**: This defines the logarithmic abundance ratio of element X to Y relative to the Sun.
2. **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: Star_1 has the same iron-to-hydrogen abundance as the Sun.
3. **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Silicon is 0.3 dex more abundant relative to iron in Star_1 than in the Sun.
4. **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Magnesium is 0.3 dex more abundant relative to silicon in Star_2 than in the Sun.
5. **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: Star_2 has the same magnesium-to-hydrogen abundance as the Sun.
6. **Solar abundances**:
   - **log(nFe/nH)_☉ = -4.5** → **nFe/nH_☉ = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵**.
   - **log(nMg/nH)_☉ = -5** → **nMg/nH_☉ = 1 × 10⁻⁵**.
   - **log(nSi/nH)_☉ = 0** → **nSi/nH_☉ = 1**.

### Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_1
- **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**:  
  log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_☉ + 0.3 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 → **nSi/nFe_1 = 10⁰.³ ≈ 2**.
- **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**:  
  log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_☉ + 0 = -4.5 → **nFe/nH_1 = 3.16 × 10⁻⁵**.
- **nSi/nH_1 = (nSi/nFe_1) × (nFe/nH_1)**:  
  **nSi/nH_1 = 2 × (3.16 × 10⁻⁵) = 6.32 × 10⁻⁵**.
- **[Si/H]_1 = log(nSi/nH_1) − log(nSi/nH)_☉**:  
  log(nSi/nH_1) = log(6.32 × 10⁻⁵) = log(6.32) + log(10⁻⁵) ≈ 0.8 + (-5) = -4.2.  
  Since log(nSi/nH)_☉ = 0, **[Si/H]_1 = -4.2**.

### Step 2: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_2
- **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**:  
  log(nMg/nSi)_2 = log(nMg/nSi)_☉ + 0.3 = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 → **nMg/nSi_2 = 10⁰.³ ≈ 2**.
- **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**:  
  log(nMg/nH)_2 = log(nMg/nH)_☉ + 0 = -5 → **nMg/nH_2 = 1 × 10⁻⁵**.
- **nSi/nH_2 = (nMg/nH_2) / (nMg/nSi_2)**:  
  **nSi/nH_2 = (1 × 10⁻⁵) / 2 = 5 × 10⁻⁶**.
- **[Si/H]_2 = log(nSi/nH_2) − log(nSi/nH)_☉**:  
  log(nSi/nH_2) = log(5 × 10⁻⁶) = log(5) + log(10⁻⁶) ≈ 0.7 + (-6) = -5.3.  
  Since log(nSi/nH)_☉ = 0, **[Si/H]_2 = -5.3**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Ratio of Silicon Abundances
The ratio of silicon abundances is given by:  
\[
\text{Ratio} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}
\]
Substitute the values:  
\[
\text{Ratio} = 10^{-4.2 - (-5.3)} = 10^{1.1} \approx 12.6
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **12.6**.

**Answer: B**
