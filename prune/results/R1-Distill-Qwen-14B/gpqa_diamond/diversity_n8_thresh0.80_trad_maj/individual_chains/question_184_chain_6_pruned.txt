Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to determine which sequence will give the desired product in high yield.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw out the structure of the target molecule to understand what substituents are present and their positions. The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: an ethoxy group (OEt), a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and a nitro group (NO2). Let me number the positions. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-Bu, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, but wait—benzene numbering can be tricky. Let me visualize benzene: if position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is t-Bu, and position 3 is nitro, that's a meta arrangement between ethoxy and nitro. Alternatively, maybe I should look at the substituents in order. Oh wait, in the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order: ethoxy, nitro, tert-butyl. So the position numbers are based on that order. Let me see: the substituents are ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, then tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, when I look at the ring, each substituent is adjacent in a way that their positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene, with substituents on adjacent carbons. So, ethoxy is in position 1, t-Bu in 2, nitro in 3. So it's a vicinal arrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the substituent positions in the product. So, the molecule should have all three substituents attached to the benzene ring, each in specific positions.

Now, I need to figure out the order of substituent introduction. Since we start with benzene, we need to add these substituents step by step. The key here is understanding the directing effects of each substituent and how each reaction affects the substituent positions.

Let me recall the directing effects: 

- Nitro groups are meta directors.
- Ethoxy groups are ortho/para directors (since it's an activating group, but wait, no—ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent because it's an electron-donating group via lone pairs).
Wait, no. Wait, wait, actually, substituents can be activating or deactivating. Nitro is a strong deactivating (because of the electron-withdrawing effect) and meta-directing. Ethoxy is activating (since the oxygen has lone pairs which can donate electrons via resonance), so it's ortho/para directing. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating group (since it's an alkyl group, which is electron-donating via induction), so it's ortho
