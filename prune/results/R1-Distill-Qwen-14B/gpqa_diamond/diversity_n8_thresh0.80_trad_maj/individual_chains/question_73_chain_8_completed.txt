Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Let me read the question again and figure out what needs to be done.

The problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because that doesn't account for the effects of special relativity. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory.

Wait, the relative speed would be the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference, right? So let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. So the relative speed would be the speed of B as seen from A's frame, or vice versa? Or does it matter which way we calculate it?

Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify direction, just asks for the relative speed. Maybe the formula handles it. Let me recall the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u is the speed of one object in another's frame.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: in the rest frame S, astronaut A is moving at v = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at u = 0.5c. But if we want to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, which is moving at v = 0.6c relative to S, then we need to apply the velocity addition formula.

So the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). 

So substituting u = 0.5c and v = 0.6c:

u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)) 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (0.5 - 0.6)c = (-0.1)c → -0.1c. Wait, but speed is a magnitude, but perhaps the negative indicates direction. But since the problem mentions positive x-direction, maybe the relative speed is the magnitude. Or perhaps the question just wants the magnitude, so 0.1c? Wait, but looking at the options, one of them is 0.14c and another is 0.1c.

Wait, let me compute the denominator first: 1 - ( (0.5c)(0.6c) )/c².

(0.5 * 0.6) c² / c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857c. So the magnitude is 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. So that's one part done.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy.

Each astronaut's energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute each one:

First astronaut (mass 2m) moving at 0.6c:
gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.
So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m) moving at 0.5c:
gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² = 1.1547 * 3 ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc² which is lower, but our calculation is around 5.96.

So the correct answer would have relative speed 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc². Looking back, option C has both 0.14c and 5.96 mc². So the correct choice is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed:
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is determined using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.5c \) (speed of astronaut B) and \( v = 0.6c \) (speed of astronaut A). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

Taking the magnitude, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy:
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of both astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c, E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
