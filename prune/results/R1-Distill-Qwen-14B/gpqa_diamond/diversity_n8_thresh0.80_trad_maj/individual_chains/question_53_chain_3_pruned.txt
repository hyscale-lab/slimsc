Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. The options are four different formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given spectral data.

First, let's start with the FTIR part. The problem states that the IR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. I remember that esters have a characteristic carbonyl group (C=O) which absorbs around 1720-1740 cm⁻¹. So that's a key functional group here.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. The problem says there are six signals. Let's break down what each of these signals represents.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H: Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern will determine the number of distinct aromatic protons. If the substituents are in positions that create equivalent protons, we might have fewer signals. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each set giving a singlet. But wait, the problem says two signals, so maybe it's not para? Hmm, more likely, perhaps ortho or meta substitution. But wait, di-substituted benzene can have different splitting based on the substituents. Alternatively, maybe the substituents themselves cause different environments for the aromatic protons. But I'll come back to that.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H: Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring. But wait, the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring, so maybe the substituents include some groups with vinyl protons. For example, if one substituent is an ester group and another is an alkene or something that has vinyl protons. Alternatively, the substituents themselves might not be aromatic but have vinyl groups. The NMR mentions one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So two different types of vinyl protons.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. Each of these would be a triplet or something else, but since there are two signals, maybe there are two different types of methyl groups. For instance, if one substituent has a methyl group and another substituent has a different environment for a methyl group. Or perhaps the substituents themselves have different environments so their methyl protons split into two signals.

Importantly, there are no signals corresponding to –
