Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with energy levels in atoms, especially in stellar atmospheres, the Boltzmann equation comes into play. The Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy states to temperature.

The Boltzmann factor is something like (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight. But in this case, the energy level difference is given, and I think the ratio of the populations is given as well.

So the ratio of the excited states in star 1 to star 2 is 2. Let me think. The ratio N1/N2 = 2. But wait, the energy level difference is the same for both stars. So for each star, the excitation depends on their respective temperatures.

The Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

N_i / N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this problem, I think E_i is the higher energy level, so E2 > E1. So the energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1 =1.38e-23 J.

So for star 1, the population is N1, and for star 2, it's N2. Given that N1 = 2 * N2, perhaps? Or maybe the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2
