Okay, so I'm a bit confused about this question, but let's try to break it down. So, the question is about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair, and why a green signal isn't showing up under the microscope.

First, let me understand the setup. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs (open reading frames), right? So the vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end, followed by mCherry, and then the receptor ORF at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, so the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so that's probably driving the expression of the ligand. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a second promoter. So the receptor is probably being expressed from the same transcript as the ligand, but using IRES to initiate its own translation.

Now, the stops are in loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, right, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites, so they don't recombine with each other. Cre recombinase would excise the stop cassette if it recognizes the lox sites. So if you have Cre, it would delete the stop cassettes.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is fused to mCherry. So the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop cassette, then mCherry. But wait, if the stop is in a loxP cassette, and the Cre is introduced, that would delete the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed after the ligand. But in the initial setup, since it's a vector without Cre, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed unless the stop is removed.

Wait, but in the question, they transfected the vector into primary astrocyte culture. So unless Cre is present, the stops are intact. So the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would not, because of the stop. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed only if the stop is removed.

But wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the first ORF (ligand) is under CBA, then IRES, then the receptor. So the same transcript is made, but the ligand is translated first, then IRES allows the receptor to be translated. But the ligand is followed by the stop cassette (loxP), so without Cre, mCherry isn't expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by another stop cassette (lox2272), so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the experiment, they're using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So after transfection, they do a Western blot. The problem says the signal is proportional to actin loading, so the blot is working. So probably, both ligand and receptor are being expressed, but the fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP) are not, because the stops are in place. Or wait, maybe the stops are between the ORF and the fluorescent proteins. So the ligand is expressed, but not mCherry. Receptor is expressed, but not eGFP.

But wait, the vector's setup: ligand ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, and then the stop prevents mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by stop in lox2272, so eGFP is not expressed. So when they do the Western, they're using antibodies against the ligand and receptor, not the fluorescent proteins. Because the construct includes ORFs for ligand and receptor, which are under expression, and they have stop cassettes before the fluorescent tags.

Wait, but then in the mouse model, they've made a construct that's homozygous. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells, I think. SOX10-Cre would mean that Cre is expressed under the control of SOX10 promoter, so Cre is active in the neural crest and perhaps other derivatives.

So when they cross the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed. Because the lox sites are different, Cre would only excise the appropriate cassette. So in the ligand region, the loxP sites would be cut, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 sites would
