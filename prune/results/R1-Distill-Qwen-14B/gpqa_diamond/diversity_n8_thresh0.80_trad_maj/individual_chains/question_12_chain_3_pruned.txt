Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember.

The problem states that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D with two values each.

Wait, okay, so when a particle decays at rest, conservation of energy and momentum must be applied. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the final momentum vectors of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out. That means their magnitudes are equal and opposite. But neutrinos are super light, almost massless. So the muon's momentum would be almost the same as the neutrino's, but wait, noâ€”neutrinos have negligible mass, so their momentum is approximately the same as the muon's, but opposite in direction.

Wait, no: The pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. So their magnitudes of momentum are the same. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum (because E = pc for massless particles). The muon has significant mass, so its energy would be more than just its momentum.

Wait, but let's think about conservation of energy. The initial energy is the rest energy of the p
