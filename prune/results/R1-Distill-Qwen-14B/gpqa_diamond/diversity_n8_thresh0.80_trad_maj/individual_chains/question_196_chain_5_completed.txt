Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a harmonic oscillator in a relativistic context. The setup is 1-dimensional, obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one. 

Wait, right—relativistic means we have to consider the effects of special relativity, like how mass increases with velocity. In non-relativistic cases, the maximum speed would be when all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But here, since it's relativistic, the energy calculations are a bit different.

So, in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that equals the kinetic energy at maximum speed, which is (1/2)mv². So solving for v would give v = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh wait, looking at the options, option C is that expression. But this is a relativistic scenario, so maybe C isn't the right answer here.

But wait, in relativity, particles can't reach the speed of light. The energy equations must include gamma, the Lorentz factor, which is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy would include relativistic kinetic energy. 

Hmm, the system's total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the potential energy at maximum displacement, which is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1)mc², right? Or wait, no, wait. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is the remaining. So total energy E = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc². So E = gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or wait, no. Wait, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So combining them, the total energy would be (gamma) mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc². No, wait, that can't be right. Because the rest energy is mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy is mc² + (gamma -1) mc² = gamma mc². 

Wait, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and that's when the kinetic energy is zero. At maximum speed, which occurs when the oscillator is at x=0, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. So in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let's clarify. The total mechanical energy (E) of the oscillator is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential: E = (1/2)k A². At x=0 (maximum velocity), all energy is kinetic. So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy (K) is (gamma -1) mc². So E = K. So,

(1/2)k A² = (gamma -1) mc².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (1/(2 mc²)) k A².

Wait, that's:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but gamma is also 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, let's call it t for a moment. So,

gamma = 1 + t.

But then, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + t.

We can solve for v in terms of t. Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + t)^2.

Taking reciprocal,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + t)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + t)^2.

Hmm, but t is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

v² = c² ( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Let me compute this:

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ]

Hmm, so let me compute the denominator term:

(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to expand it as:

(1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a², where a = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But maybe you can express it as:

v^2 = c² [ ( (1 + a)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a)^2 ) ]

Wait, let's compute the numerator inside the brackets:

1 - 1/(1+a)^2 = [ (1+a)^2 -1 ] / (1+a)^2.

Which is [ (1 + 2a +a²) -1 ] / (1+a)^2 = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * (2a + a²)/(1 + a)^2.

But a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), so let me plug that in:

2a = (k A²)/(m c²), and a² = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ ( (k A²)/(m c^2) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out (k A²)/(2 m c²) somehow. Let me see.

Let me denote a = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

2a = (k A^2)/(m c^2), and a² is as before.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Which is c^2 [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm. Alternatively, I can write:

v = c * sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a )

But perhaps I can factor this differently.

Wait, perhaps looking back at the options, option D is:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Which would match with my earlier expression: v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1+a)^2 ] where a = (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ), which is option D.

Alternatively, let's compute 1/(1 + a)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Which is exactly what I have for v.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because from our earlier steps, 

v^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1+a)^2 ]

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1+a)^2 )

Which is option D.

But let me check other options.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))² )

Wait, that denominator inside the square root is (1 - (k A²)/(2m)), which seems to be non-relativistic terms, but that doesn't make sense because (k A^2)/(2m) could be greater than 1, making denominator negative, which would cause problem. Hmm, but in reality, in the relativistic case, the denominator would involve mc², so perhaps that's why option A's denominator is (1 - (kA²)/(2m)), which seems off.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

But that denominator would be (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ), which when inverted and added 1 would give a larger value, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in my calculation, the expression is 1 - 1/(1+a)^2, where a is (k A²)/(2 m c^2). So 1+a is (2 m c^2 + k A²)/(2 m c^2). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: perhaps considering the energy.

In the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)k A^2 = (1/2) m v_max^2.

So v_max = sqrt(k A^2/m), which is option C. But that's non-relativistic.

In the relativistic case, the energy is higher because E = gamma mc^2, which must be equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement, (1/2)k A^2.

Wait, no—wait, the potential energy is (1/2)k A^2, and the kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (gamma -1) mc^2. So total energy is (gamma) mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2.

Wait, that can't be right because the potential energy is (1/2)k A^2, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc^2. So,

gamma mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 mc^2)

Let me let a = (k A^2)/(2 mc^2), so,

1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + a.

So,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1+a) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 +a)^2 → v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 +a)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2 ).

Where a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So substituting back,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which matches option D.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system's energy. The total energy of the oscillator is equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement, \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At maximum speed, all the energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy, which is given by \( K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy to the kinetic energy:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\gamma = 1 + a.
\]

From the definition of \( \gamma \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + a.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + a)^2.
\]

Taking the reciprocal:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2 \):

\[
v^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2} \right).
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy analysis:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect denominators that do not account for the relativistic energy relationship.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \), which does not include relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
