Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the problem says there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, the masses might not directly matter here; the question is about the silicon abundance ratio in their photospheres. The data given involves elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. Oh right, that's a method used in spectroscopy to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Hmm, so the brackets mean logarithmic abundances relative to hydrogen or another element.

Wait, the brackets notation: [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. Oh, right, so it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X and Y, scaled by their solar ratio.

So, for Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3. Because [X/Y] = log(Si/Fe) - log(Si/Fe)_sun. So if [Si/Fe]_1 is +0.3, that means (n_Si_1 / n_Fe_1) = 10^(0.3) * (n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun).

And for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. So (n_Mg_2 / n_Si_2) = 10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun).

Also, given that [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So the ratio of Fe to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Since [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun). So log(n_Fe_1/n_H_1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun), meaning n_Fe_1/n_H_1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So n_Mg_2/n_H_2 = n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun.

The question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, which is (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2).

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Find n_Si_1 in terms of n_Fe_1 and the solar ratios.
2. Find n_Si_2 in terms of n_Mg_2 and the solar ratios.
3. Use the given [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2 to relate n_Fe_1, n_H_1, n_Mg_2, n_H_2 to their solar values.
4. Combine the equations to find the ratio n_Si_1/n_Si_2.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun).

But I don't know n_Si_sun or n_Fe_sun, but maybe I can express everything relative to H. Because we have the solar compositions given.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5.

Wait, wait, the notation is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12=-5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5).

So in the Sun, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5), nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

Ok, now back to Star_1.

[Fe/H]_1 is 0 → log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun /nH_sun) → nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

So nFe_1 = nH_1 * 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → which is log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

Wait, let me compute log(nSi_sun /nFe_sun) from the given Sun's data.

We have nFe_sun /nH_sun =10^(-4.5) → nFe_sun =nH_sun * 10^(-4.5).

nSi_sun is another value. Wait, the Sun's composition isn't given for Si directly. Oh wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is not given. Hmm, perhaps I can get nSi_sun from the data provided elsewhere or maybe I need to express nSi in terms of nMg or something else.

Wait, I think I can find nSi_sun from the given solar data. Let me see.

Wait, the Sun's nMg/nH is 10^(-5), as we had earlier.

But we don't have the Sun's [Mg/Si] value, so perhaps I need to assume that the Sun's [Mg/Si] is zero? Or maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but the problem states that the given photospheric composition for the Sun includes 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7, but nothing about Si. Hmm, so I might need to find [Mg/Si]_sun?

Wait, in the absence of data, perhaps I can compute [Mg/Si]_sun. Because for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun) - log(nMg_sun /nSi_sun)_sun? Wait, no. Wait, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is zero. So if I can find nMg_sun and nSi_sun relative to H, perhaps I can compute [Mg/Si]_sun.

Wait, but the problem states that in the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) is 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) is -4.
