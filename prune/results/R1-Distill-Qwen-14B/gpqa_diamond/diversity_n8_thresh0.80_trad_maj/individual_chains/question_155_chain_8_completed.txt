Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, which is ΔP_z.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then plug them into this formula.

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ might not be zero. Hmm, no, wait, actually, if the state isn't an eigenstate, the expectation value is just the average, but the variance would come from the spread.

Wait, but wait. Let me first make sure I understand the setup. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because P_z is one of the operators, and the basis is usually the eigenbasis of one of the operators when dealing with matrix representations.

So the given state is a vector in this basis. The state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

First, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. Oh, wait, but since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the matrix P_z is diagonal. Because diagonal matrices in their eigenbasis have the eigenvalues on the diagonal. Looking at P_z's matrix: the first diagonal element is ħ, the second is 0, the third is -ħ. So in the P_z basis, the matrix is diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of the components of the state multiplied by the corresponding diagonal elements.

Wait, no. The state is a column vector, so to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this can be simplified.

So let's break it down. The state is ψ = [ a, b, c ], where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

The diagonal elements of P_z are [ ħ, 0, -ħ ].

So ⟨P_z⟩ = a^2 * ħ + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-ħ).

Wait, no. Wait, since it's a column vector, the components are |ψ> = [ a; b; c ].

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can take the conjugate transpose (since we're dealing with quantum mechanics, which is typically in complex vectors, but here the state has real components?), wait, the state is given as real numbers here. So the conjugate doesn't change anything.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = a* * ħ * a + b* * 0 * b + c* * (-ħ) * c.

But since a and c are real, it's a^2 * ħ + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * (-ħ).

So substituting the values:

a = -1/2 → a² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
c = -1/2 → c² = 1/4.
b = 1/sqrt(2) → b² = 1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) * ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = [ (1/4 -1/4) ] ħ = 0. So the average P_z is zero.

Hmm, interesting. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is also diagonal, with elements (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. So P_z squared has diagonal entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = a^2 * ħ² + b^2 * 0 + c^2 * ħ².

Again, a² and c² are 1/4 each. So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) ħ² + (1/2)(0) + (1/4) ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - (0) ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that would make the uncertainty ħ divided by square root of 2. Looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), option C is ħ/2. I think that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I compute ⟨P_z⟩ correctly? Because sometimes when you have a state that's a linear combination of eigenstates, the expectation value can be zero if it's symmetric. But in this case, let me think about the state:

The state is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ].

So in the P_z basis, the state is a combination of the |+> state (eigenvalue +ħ), the |0> state (eigenvalue 0), and the |-> state (eigenvalue -ħ).

The coefficients for |+> and |-> are both -1/2. Wait, no, wait: the first component is the coefficient for |+>, the second for |0>, the third for |->.

Wait, so the components are:

- Coefficient of |+> (P_z = ħ) is -1/2.

- Coefficient of |0> is 1/sqrt(2).

- Coefficient of |-> (P_z = -ħ) is -1/2.

So when calculating ⟨P_z⟩, it's (-1/2)^2 * ħ + (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * (-ħ). Oh wait! Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait a second. The expectation value is sum ( |amplitude|^2 * eigenvalue ).

Ah, right. So for the |+> eigenstate, the eigenvalue is +ħ, but the coefficient is -1/2. So |coefficient|^2 is (1/2)^2=1/4.

So for the first term: (1/4) * ħ.

Third term: (1/4) * (-ħ) → because the eigenvalue is -ħ. So the third term is (1/4)(-ħ).

So adding them: (1/4 ħ) + (0) + (-1/4 ħ) = 0. So yes, the expectation is zero.

Wait, but wait again. So the state |ψ> is a linear combination of |+>, |0>, and |->. So when you calculate ⟨P_z⟩, you're taking the sum of |c_i|^2 multiplied by the eigenvalue for each state.

So for |+>, |c1|^2 is (1/2)^2=1/4, eigenvalue is +ħ → 1/4 * ħ.

For |->, |c3|^2 is (1/2)^2=1/4, eigenvalue is -ħ → 1/4 * (-ħ).

So adding those gives 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now for ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the sum of |c_i|^2 times (eigenvalue)^2.

Eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So their squares are ħ², 0, ħ².

So the sum is (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

So that's option B.

Wait, but wait, could there be a mistake in the matrix setup? Let me just make sure I'm not missing anything.

The problem states that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal, which is correct.

The state is given as a column vector in this basis, so the calculation I did is correct.

So the answer should be option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ along the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $c_i$ are the components of the state $|\psi\rangle$ and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Substituting the values:

- For the first component $c_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $\lambda_1 = \hbar$.
- For the second component $c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $|c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $\lambda_2 = 0$.
- For the third component $c_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $|c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $\lambda_3 = -\hbar$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar - \frac{1}{4} \hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2.
\]

Substituting the values:

- For the first component $c_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $|c_1|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $\lambda_1^2 = \hbar^2$.
- For the second component $c_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, $|c_2|^2 = \frac{1}{2}$, and $\lambda_2^2 = 0$.
- For the third component $c_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $|c_3|^2 = \frac{1}{4}$, and $\lambda_3^2 = \hbar^2$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
