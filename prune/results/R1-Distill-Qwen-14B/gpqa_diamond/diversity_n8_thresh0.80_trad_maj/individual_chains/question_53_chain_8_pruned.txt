Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, so there's probably an -O-CO-O- or more likely an ester group like -O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-R, right? So the presence of an ester group in the IR suggests we have that functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Wait, wait, the ring is aromatic, so the six-membered ring would have protons. But it's di-substituted, so the ring protons would split into different signals based on their positions. But wait, the NMR has two signals for aromatic protons. Hmm, that suggests that the two substituents are para to each other because that would give a symmetrical structure, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. Because if the substituents were in the para positions, the ring would have equivalent protons in two positions, each giving a single peak.

Then, the NMR also shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond. So, perhaps the substituents are vinyl groups or part of an ester group that has a double bond. Wait, the ester itself doesn't have a double bond. Oh, but maybe the substituent is an acyl group attached via a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, in the NMR, the vinyl-Hs are one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, maybe the substituent has a vinyl group, like an ethylene chain attached somewhere. The fact that one is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets suggests coupling with different numbers of neighboring protons.

Also, the NMR has two signals for -CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups. And no signals for -CH2, which means there are no methylene groups in the molecule. Hmm.

So, putting this together. The compound is a di-ester perhaps? Or maybe an ester and another group. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, if it's a di-substituted benzene, let's say the substituents are two ester groups. But wait, di-substituted with two ester groups? That would be something like two O-CO-O-R groups attached to the ring. But that might not fit the NMR description.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group, like a substituted acetylene? Or perhaps it's a substituted ethylene group.

Wait, another possibility: it's a ring with an ester substituent and another group that has a vinyl structure. For example, perhaps the ring is meta or para substituted with an ester and a vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So, perhaps each substituent is a vinyl group? Or perhaps a substituent is a group with two vinyl protons.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are ester groups with some vinyl structure. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think about the possible groups. The ester functional group is O-CO-O-R. Maybe one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, where R could be an alkyl or aryl group. But the other substituent must have vinyl protons and two methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acetic acid ester, like OAc, but that would be a single substituent. Hmm, but the molecule is di-substituted. So maybe two ester groups are not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. Wait, but two substituents being a vinyl and an ester. Let me imagine that.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of protons.

The aromatic ring has two substituents, which cause the aromatic protons to split into two signals. So, perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, making the ring symmetrical. That would lead to two sets of aromatic protons.

Each substituent would contribute their own protons to the NMR. Let's see, the substituents might be an ester and a vinyl group, but that's just a guess.

Wait, the NMR shows
