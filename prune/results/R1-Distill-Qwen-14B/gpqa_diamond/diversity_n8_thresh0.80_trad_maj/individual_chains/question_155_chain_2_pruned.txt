Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in quantum mechanics. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which I think means that the state is expressed in the Pz eigenbasis.

Wait, but wait. The operators Px, Py, and Pz are given as matrices. So, the state is already in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors. That might simplify things because when the state is expressed in an eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value of that operator is just the eigenvalue. But here, we're dealing with Pz's uncertainty, and the state is an eigenvector of Px. Hmm.

Uncertainty in quantum mechanics is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So, for Pz, I need to find ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩.

But wait, since the system is in an eigenstate of Px, I'm not sure if ⟨Pz⟩ is zero or not. Let me think. If the state is an eigenstate of Px, then the expectation values of Py and Pz might not be zero, unless the state is also an eigenstate of those. But generally, they can have non-zero expectation values.

Wait, but the state is given, so maybe I can just compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ directly using the state vector.

The state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

First, let me write down the matrix for Pz. From the question, it's a 3x3 matrix where the first row is [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0,0,0], and third row [0,0,-ħ]. So,

Pz = [[ħ, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, -ħ]]

Wait, no, wait. The matrix is written as having the first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So yes, that's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

So, since the basis is the eigenvectors of Pz, each basis vector corresponds to one of these eigenvalues. So, the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let me see, in this basis, the state is expressed as a column vector [a, b, c], where a = ⟨+|ψ⟩, b = ⟨0|ψ⟩, c = ⟨-|ψ⟩, where |+⟩, |0⟩, |−⟩ are the eigenstates of Pz with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

So, for our state, a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

To find the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩, I can compute ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩. Since in this basis, Pz is
