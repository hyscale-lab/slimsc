Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). Pi(+) is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with various KE values.

Hmm, wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? I think in many cases, the mass of the neutrino is considered to be negligible compared to the other particles. So maybe I can treat the neutrino as massless. That should make calculations easier.

So, the process is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of mu+ and nu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu, but since neutrinos are so light, their momentum would be approximately the same magnitude as muon's but opposite direction.

Wait, but since neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy would be approximately equal to its momentum times c (but in units where c=1, so E = p). So, the muon's energy would be E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but since we're working in MeV and things like that, perhaps I can ignore some factors. Let me think in natural units where c=1, so E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

Since the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu (because m_nu is ~0), and the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2). Also, since the momenta are equal and opposite, p_mu = p_nu. Let's call the magnitude of p as 'p'.

So, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass of Pi+, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu. Since energy must be conserved, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But E_nu is p. E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2). So,

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me write that equation down:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, I need to solve for p.

Let me denote sqrt(p² + m_mu²) as something. Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p².

So,

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides:

105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p.

Let me compute 105.7 squared and 139.6 squared.

105.7² = approx 11171.49 MeV². Let me compute 105.7 * 105.7. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is 32.49. The cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10,000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49. Wait, perhaps I should just calculate it accurately.

105.7 * 105.7:

105 * 105 = 11,025.

0.7 * 105 = 73.5.

Wait, maybe a better way: 105.7 = 100 +5.7.

(100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10,000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49 MeV².

Similarly, 139.6^2 = ?

Well, 140^2 is 19,600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140.

So (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So,

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 2*139.6*p.

Let me subtract 19,488.16 from both sides:

11,172.49 -19,488.16 = -2*139.6*p.

So (11,172.49 -19,488.16) = -8,315.67 = -2*139.6*p.

So,

-8,315.67 = -279.2 * p.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

p = 8,315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

279.2 * 29 = 8,100 approx. 279.2 * 30=8,376, which is a bit larger than 8,315.67. So let's see:

279.2 * 29.7 = ?

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 8,100 (approx 8,096.8), and 0.7 * 279.2=195.44. So total 8,096.8 +195.44=8,292.24. Hmm, but 8,315.67 is a bit higher.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = 29.8 * 279.2.

Compute 30 * 279.2 = 8,376.

Subtract 0.2 * 279.2 = 55.84.

So 8,376 -55.84=8,320.16.

Wait, wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30-0.2) = 8376 - 55.84= 8320.16.

But our numerator is 8315.67.

So 8,315.67 is 8,320.16-4.49. So that's 29.8 - (4.49/279.2) ≈ let's see, 4.49 /279.2 ≈0.016.

So p≈29.8 -0.016 ≈29.784.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 8,315.67 /279.2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as:

p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's see:

279.2 * 29 = 8,100 (exactly, 279.2*29=279.2*(30-1)=8,376 - 279.2=8,096.8).

We have 8,315.67 -8,096.8=218.87.

So 218.87 /279.2 ≈approx 0.783.

So 29 + 0.783 =29.783.

So p≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, the units. Since we're working in MeV and c=1, the momentum
