Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the setup is that Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, so there shouldn't be many gas molecules around.

But despite that, some gas particles are still present, detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? Factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment would affect that.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. But the temperature stayed the same. So why would λ2 be different from λ1?

Wait, so what determines the mean free path? I remember that the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure P and directly proportional to the average speed of the molecules. The formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. Oh wait, no—wait, another formula I remember is λ ≈ (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), but sometimes it's written as λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P) multiplied by something else? Or maybe I'm mixing up the exact expression.

Alternatively, another approach: the mean free path is given by the Knudsen relation, where λ = L * (P/(T)), but that's probably not right. Wait, the Knudsen number is the ratio of mean free path to a characteristic dimension, like the diameter of the system. Oh, but in this case, the main factors are pressure and temperature.

So, in the initial state, when the system is at ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path λ1 is calculated. Then, when the electron beam is turned on, perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized or charged by the electrons. Because when the electron beam hits the gas molecules, it can cause them to become charged. Charged particles would behave differently in the electric fields within the microscope.

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path? Well, charged particles (ions or electrons) would interact more with the surrounding electric fields. If the gas molecules are neutral, they don't interact with the electric fields as much, so their movement is more random. But if they're charged, maybe their direction is influenced more by the beam or other electric fields in the microscope, causing them to move in a different way.

Wait, actually, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might become ionized because the high-energy electrons from the beam can knock electrons off the gas atoms, creating ions. These ions would then be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope. Ions tend to experience stronger forces in electric fields compared to neutral molecules. So, how would this affect their movement and the mean free path?

The mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. If the gas becomes partially ionized, the ions might move faster due to the electric fields, or perhaps they are deflected, causing more frequent collisions. Wait, but wait: the primary factor for the mean free path is the number density of molecules. Or is it the presence of other charged particles that affects the scattering?

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is neutral, the mean free path is determined by collisions between gas molecules. But if the gas becomes ionized, the ions might not collide as often because they're moving faster or in a different manner. Or maybe the presence of charged particles leads to different types of interactions. Wait, but in this scenario, the pressure (number of particles) hasn't changed, right? The vacuum pumps are running, but some gas remains. So the pressure P is the same before and after the electron beam is turned on.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the number of ions increases. Ions contribute to the overall pressure in terms of their density. Wait, but the pressure is still the same as before because the number of particles (ions plus neutral) is about the same as before. So the pressure hasn't changed, so the mean free path shouldn't change because λ is inversely proportional to pressure, right?

Hmm, but that's confusing. Because Mike observed that the mean free path changed from λ1 to λ2. So why would that happen if the pressure is the same?

Wait, the mean free path calculation is based on the assumption that the gas is in thermal equilibrium and that the particles are moving randomly. But when the electron beam is applied, the gas molecules might become ionized, and these ions could be accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope. This could cause the ions to move in a more directed path, perhaps along the electric field lines, rather than moving randomly. So, their mean free path might effectively increase because they're moving in a more ordered fashion and colliding less frequently.

Wait, but wait a second. If the ions are moving along the electric field, they might be more likely to interact with the walls or other structures in the microscope, causing them to collide more often. Or maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, when the gas is neutral, the mean free path is determined by collisions between the gas molecules. When some of them become charged (ions), their behavior changes. Ions are influenced by the electric fields and can be accelerated, which might change their velocity distribution. This could affect the mean free path. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is neutral, the mean free path is longer because the collisions are infrequent. If the gas is ionized, maybe the ions are moving faster, so their mean free path would be longer? Or, perhaps the presence of ions could lead to more frequent collisions because they might interact with other ions or charged particles more often.

Wait, but considering that the pressure is the same, the number density (n) is the same. The mean free path formula is λ = 1/(n * σ * sqrt(2) * π * (kT/(m))^(1/2)), where σ is the collision cross-section. So, if the temperature is the same and pressure is the same, then the mean free path should remain the same. So why did Mike observe λ2 different from λ1?

Wait, but perhaps the electron beam introduces other factors. The ions created by the electron beam could have a different effective cross-section for collisions. Or perhaps the ions are more likely to interact with the electron beam, which is a factor in the scattering.

Wait, but the question says that the temperature remained the same. So T is same. The initial mean free path λ1 was determined based on the vacuum state, so it's under conditions where gas is neutral and unaffected by the beam. When the beam is on, perhaps the ions are being accelerated, so their velocities change. Higher velocities would lead to a longer mean free path because they move faster and take longer between collisions. But wait, the mean free path formula λ is inversely proportional to n and proportional to the average speed. So higher speed would increase λ, and same n would mean the same overall λ. Wait, unless n has changed.

Wait, but in the scenario, the pressure is the same, so n is the same. Because P = n k T (if ideal gas). So if n is same and T same, P same, λ should be same. But Mike sees λ2 different. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps when the beam is on, the gas molecules are being heated. Wait, but the question says the temperature remained same. So that's not it.

Another angle: in the presence of an electric field, charged particles may experience a force, which could influence their motion and thus affect the mean free path. But how?

Let me think about the formula for mean free path again. The mean free path depends on the number density of molecules, their collision cross-section, and their average speed. So, if after the beam is turned on, the gas becomes ionized, the effective cross-section for collisions might change. For example, if the ions are moving faster, their collision cross-section might be different, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in a vacuum, the mean free path is dominated by collisions between gas molecules. But when you have an electron beam, the electrons can cause gas molecules to become ionized. The ions then have a different interaction with the vacuum—because ions have a charge, they might stick to charged parts of the microscope, or perhaps move in a more directed way, which could reduce the effective mean free path because they are being pulled towards certain areas, causing more frequent interactions.

Wait, but that would lead to a shorter mean free path. Because if the ions are being directed, they might hit the walls or other structures more often, leading to more frequent collisions, thus a shorter λ. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electric field from the electron beam causes the ions to flow in a particular direction, reducing the number density in some regions and increasing in others. But that might complicate things beyond the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Before the beam is on, the gas is neutral, so the molecules collide with each other. When the beam is on, the gas becomes ionized. The ions might be accelerated, moving faster, so their mean free path would be longer because they're moving faster. But wait, let's think about the formula for mean free path.

The mean free path λ = (average speed) * (mean time between collisions). The average speed is sqrt(3kT/m), where m is the mass of the molecule. If the molecule becomes an ion, its mass is effectively the same (if it's an ion, m is about the same as the neutral molecule), so the average speed would be same. So that wouldn't change λ.

But wait, the cross-section for collisions might change. If the ion has a larger effective diameter due to charge, the collision cross-section σ could increase. If σ increases, then the mean free path λ = 1/(n σ v), where v is the average speed. So if σ increases, λ decreases.

Alternatively, if the ion is moving faster because it's being accelerated by the electric field, but that might be a different effect.

Wait, but the presence of the electric field could cause the ions to drift in a particular direction, which might change the effective number density in the sample compartment. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are being removed from the compartment more efficiently when the beam is on. For example, if ions are accelerated and then extracted out of the compartment, the number density n would decrease. If n decreases, then λ increases, because λ is inversely proportional to n.

Wait, but if n decreases, then λ would increase. But how would that happen? The vacuum pumps are already running, so maybe the ions are being pumped out more effectively.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the ions are more easily captured by the vacuum pumps or by the walls, leading to a lower effective pressure (n) in the compartment. If the pressure decreases, n decreases, so λ = (k T)/(sqrt(2) π d² P) → since P is lower, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. Wait, but that would make λ2 > λ1, which would correspond to option A (if λ2 >= 1.22 λ1) or option D (if 1.22 λ1 is bigger than λ2).

But wait, the initial scenario says that the vacuum pumps are creating an ultra-high vacuum, and some gas remains. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas becomes ionized, and the ions are pumped away more efficiently. That would lower the pressure in the compartment, leading to a higher mean free path.

But the question states that the mean free path changes. So if the pressure decreased, λ increases.

But initially, Mike calculated λ1 under the ultra-high vacuum. When the beam is on, if pressure decreases further, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but the problem says that the sample compartment's temperature remains the same. So if the pressure is lower, then λ2 would be higher.

But how does the electron beam affect the pressure? Well, the beam can cause ionization, and if the ions are charged, they could be more efficiently pumped out by the vacuum system, which might have components that capture charged particles more effectively. So the presence of the beam could lead to a lower pressure, hence a higher mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be knocked out of the compartment, effectively reducing the pressure. So n would decrease, so λ increases.

In that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1, so λ2 > λ1. But looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >=1.22 λ1

Option C: λ2 < λ1

Option D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that when the gas is ionized, the mean free path increases because ions have a longer path before being scattered.

Alternatively, maybe the opposite happens. If the ions are affected by the electric fields, their paths might be more directed, causing them to hit the walls more often, thus a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The mean free path is calculated as λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). So for the same T, if P decreases, λ increases.

If the presence of the electron beam reduces the pressure (n is lower), then λ2 would be higher than λ1. So the mean free path increases.

But how does the electron beam reduce pressure? Well, if the beam causes gas molecules to be ionized, and the ions are more easily pumped out by the vacuum system, leading to lower pressure. So yes, pressure decreases, λ increases.

So Mike would find λ2 greater than λ1. So looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >=1.22*λ1

Option C: λ2 < λ1

Option D: λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1

So the correct conclusion would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. But how much greater?

Well, if the pressure is lower, λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. The options A and D suggest that λ2 is higher than λ1.

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, we can't say whether it's more or less than 1.22 times.

Wait, but the question says that the vacuum was already ultra-high (10^-9 Torr). So the initial λ1 would be very large. And when the pressure decreases further, λ2 would be even larger.

But the options don't specify the exact factor. Option A is >=1.22 λ1, D is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

But wait, why 1.22? Hmm, 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (2/pi) ) which is about 0.797, but wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414... No, wait, 1.22 is approximately the square root of (1.5), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 1.22 is the factor for the Debye length or something else. Not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a factor that reduces the mean free path. For example, the electron beam might cause more scattering events. If that's the case, λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but the electron beam is the one causing the gas to become ionized. So perhaps the ions experience more scattering because they're charged. Or maybe the ions are more likely to be scattered by the beam or other charged particles.

Wait, if the gas becomes ionized, the ions could interact with the charged particles in the beam, leading to more frequent scattering events. So the mean free path would decrease, making λ2 less than λ1.

But earlier, I thought about the possibility that the ions are being pumped away, leading to lower P and higher λ. So which effect dominates?

Hmm, perhaps the key is that in the presence of an electron beam, the gas becomes ionized, which affects the mean free path. So let's think about how ionization affects the mean free path.

In a neutral gas, the mean free path is determined by collisions between neutral molecules. When the gas is ionized, the charged particles (ions and electrons) interact differently. They may experience electric fields and could have different collision rates.

But in this case, the compartment's pressure is already extremely low. So the number of collisions is already very low. But when the beam is on, perhaps the ions are being accelerated, causing them to move faster. If the ions are moving faster, their mean free path would increase because they can go longer before colliding. But wait, the same formula applies. Since P is same, λ same. Unless the ion's speed is higher due to acceleration.

Wait, but no, the initial calculation of λ1 already accounted for thermal velocities. If the ion is accelerated, their speed is higher, so the mean free path would increase because they can go further before a collision. So λ2 would be higher than λ1.

But the mean free path formula assumes that the particles are moving at their thermal velocities. If the beam is imparting additional energy, making them move faster, then the average speed would be higher, leading to a longer mean free path.

Wait, but that's a bit of a stretch. The initial calculation was under thermal equilibrium conditions. If you have an external acceleration, like from the electric field, then the speed distribution is no longer thermal. So the average speed increases, so the mean free path increases.

In that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1. So the correct option would be either A or D, depending on how much it increases.

But I'm not sure about the exact factor. The factor given is 1.22. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path is determined by the interaction with the electron beam. When the beam is on, the electron scattering is more frequent. So the mean free path for the gas molecules (now as ions) might be shorter because they are being scattered by the electron beam.

Wait, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules due to electron scattering. So when the beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be hit by the beam's electrons, causing them to change direction, which would reduce their mean free path.

Ah, that makes sense. So the presence of the electron beam introduces an additional scattering mechanism. So the gas molecules (ions) are hit by the electrons in the beam, leading to more frequent scattering events. So the mean free path λ2 would be less than λ1.

In that case, the correct option would be C) λ2 < λ1.

But I'm a bit torn because earlier I thought about the effect of the beam on ion density. But perhaps the main effect is the increased scattering due to the beam.

Wait, the initial λ1 was calculated without the electron beam. When the beam is applied, the gas particles are subjected to more scattering events from the beam's electrons, leading to a shorter mean free path. So Mike would see λ2 < λ1.

So the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment (< 10⁻⁹ Torr) to minimize gas molecules. Despite this, some gas particles remained, and Mike calculated their mean free path as λ₁. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to λ₂, even though the temperature remained constant.

The mean free path (λ) is determined by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is the temperature, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(P\) is the pressure. Since the temperature remained the same, the primary factors affecting λ would be changes in pressure or molecular interactions.

Initially, λ₁ was calculated under the assumption of a neutral gas in thermal equilibrium. When the electron beam was applied, the gas molecules became ionized due to interactions with high-energy electrons. Ionization introduced charged particles (ions and electrons) into the system, which behave differently from neutral molecules. Charged particles are influenced by electric fields, leading to altered scattering dynamics.

Key considerations for the change in mean free path (λ₂) include:

1. **Ionization Effects**: Ionized gas particles may experience additional forces due to the electric fields in the microscope. This can alter their motion and collision rates.
2. **Scattering by the Electron Beam**: The electron beam introduces an additional scattering mechanism. Gas molecules (now ions) are more likely to interact with the beam's electrons, leading to more frequent scattering events and a shorter mean free path.
3. **Pressure Changes**: While the vacuum pumps maintain a low pressure, the ionization process could lead to changes in the effective pressure or particle density. However, the dominant effect appears to be the increased scattering due to the electron beam.

Given these factors, the presence of the electron beam increases the frequency of scattering events for the gas molecules, reducing the mean free path. Therefore, λ₂ is less than λ₁.

**Analysis of Options**:
- **A) λ₂ ≥ 1.22λ₁**: This implies an increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the increased scattering caused by the electron beam.
- **B) λ₂ = λ₁, indicating a discrepancy in Mike's observation**: This is incorrect because Mike's observation of a change in λ is valid due to the effects of ionization and scattering.
- **C) λ₂ < λ₁**: This aligns with the increased scattering caused by the electron beam, leading to a shorter mean free path.
- **D) λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22λ₁**: This suggests a moderate increase in the mean free path, which is inconsistent with the observed effects.

The correct conclusion is that λ₂ < λ₁ due to the increased scattering caused by the electron beam.

**Answer: C**
