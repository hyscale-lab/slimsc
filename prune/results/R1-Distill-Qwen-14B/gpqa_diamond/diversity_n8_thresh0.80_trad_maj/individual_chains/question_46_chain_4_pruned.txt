Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is involved in olefin metathesis reactions. Let me think about what that involves.

First, I need to understand what racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene looks like. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So pent is five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, let me count again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the double bond is between 1 and 2. The third carbon (number 3) has a methyl group. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. That makes sense. Now, the molecule is racemic, meaning it's a 50-50 mixture
