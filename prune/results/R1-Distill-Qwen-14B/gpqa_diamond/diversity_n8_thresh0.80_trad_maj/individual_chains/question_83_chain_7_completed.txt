Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Here's what's given: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which we dilute with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should figure out the concentrations after dilution. Let's break it down.

Original acetic acid: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be moles / total volume. 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Oh yeah, because when you mix two volumes, the moles stay the same but the volume increases. So 20 mL of 0.05 M is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Diluting to 40 mL (0.04 L), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's right.

Next, the titration. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So when we titrate, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid originally present.

So, the moles of acetic acid we have after dilution is 0.001 mol (as calculated earlier). So, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question asks what the pH is at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's tackle each part.

First, 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³ (since equivalence is at 10 cm³). So at 25%, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Let me think about the reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (which is OH-) to form acetate (CH3COO^-) and water.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So initially, before adding any NaOH, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, how much NaOH is added in moles?

Moles of NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, in the 40 cm³ solution (diluted acetic acid), the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. When 0.00025 mol of NaOH is added, it will react with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.00025 mol of acetate.

So after reaction:

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- = 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution after adding NaOH? Hmm. The original solution is 40 cm³, and we've added 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ Let me calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So now we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, wait. No, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Let's compute pKa. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) which is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Looking at the options, that's around 4.26. Let me check the options: option A is 4.26 and 8.52. But wait, the options are two answers each, so the first part for 25% is about 4.26? Let me think again.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I'm thinking that 25% of the equivalence point is 25% of the NaOH needed. So when 25% of the NaOH is added, it's the same as 25% of the equivalence volume. So perhaps that's correct.

But another approach: the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when you add 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 2.5 cm³, you have to calculate the moles reacted.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the buffer solution. Because at 25% titration, we're in the buffer region, so using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is valid.

Wait another thing: when adding a strong base to a weak acid, the pH at 25% of the way to equivalence is when 25% of the acid has been neutralized. So, which gives the buffer ratio of [A^-]/[HA] = 0.25. So the log of 0.25 is -0.602, so pH = pKa - 0.602 = 4.733 - 0.602 ≈ 4.131. Hmm, that's about 4.13. But in my previous calculation, I got 4.256. So which is correct?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio. Because when you add 25% of the NaOH, you're adding 0.00025 mol, which is 25% of 0.001 mol. So the moles of HA go from 0.001 to 0.00075, and A^- from 0 to 0.00025.

So the ratio is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. So the log(1/3) is -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So yes, option A's first value is 4.26. But wait, let me think about the setup again.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute using the dilutions and exact concentrations. Let me try that.

After adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution, the total volume is 42.5 cm³.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Then, pH = pKa + log (0.005882 / 0.017647) → same as before, ratio 0.333 → pH ≈4.256.

So that seems correct. So the first part is about 4.26.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and strong base, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate ions will be determined by the moles of acetate and the total volume at equivalence.

At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH, so total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid has been neutralized).

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 → approximately 0.5405e-9 or 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. We can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since Kb is so small, x will be much smaller than 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)= -5 +0.017= -4.983.

So pOH≈4.983 → pH=14 -4.983≈9.017.

Wait, but wait, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Because when you have a solution of sodium acetate, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the acetate ion. But sometimes, people use the formula pH = pKa + 1/2 pKa2 or something like that? No, no, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, another approach: the pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak base.

Alternatively, the formula for the solution of a salt of a weak acid and strong base is:

pH = pKa + log (C / sqrt(Kb * C)) )? No, perhaps it's better to proceed with the Kb approach.

Wait, I think the approach I took earlier is correct. Let me go through it again.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

Concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.02 M.

Set up the equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial: 0.02 M, 0, 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium: 0.02 - x, x, x.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 -x) → x² / (0.02) ≈ 5.405e-10.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Then [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH= -log(1.04e-5) ≈4.983 → pH=14-4.983=9.017.

Wait, but none of the options have pH around 9.02. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52 → pH at equivalence is 8.52. But I calculated around 9.02.

B) 3.17; 6.73 → 6.73.

C)4.73;7.00 →7.00.

D)4.57;6.92 →6.92.

Hmm. So according to my calculation, the equivalence point pH is around 9.02, which isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of Kb. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5 → Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 → 0.5405e-9 → 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration at equivalence. Let's see: the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³ =50 cm³. So 0.001 mol / 0.05 L =0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me compute x² again.

x² = Kb * C = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx. 3.287e-6.

Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait a second. 1e-5 is 1e-5. So 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = (1.081)^0.5 * 1e-5.5.

Wait, 1e-5.5 is 1e-5 * 1e-0.5 → approx 3.16e-6.

Wait, sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04, so 1.04 * 3.16e-6 is approximately 3.28e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.28e-6.

Wait, wait, wait! No, wait, wait. Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2 → 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6.

So, x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.29e-6 → pOH= -log(3.29e-6) → log(3.29)=0.517, so pOH=5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517.

Wait, that's around 8.52. Oh, that's option A's second value. So why did I get 9.017 earlier? Because I miscalculated the square root.

Wait, let me recompute the square root of 1.081e-11. Let's compute it accurately.

sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) → sqrt(1.081)=1.0398, sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5 = approx 3.1623e-6.

So 1.0398 *3.1623e-6 ≈ 3.283e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.283e-6 → pOH= -log(3.283e-6).

Let me calculate that more accurately. Log(3.283e-6) is log(3.283) + log(1e-6) → ≈0.5165 -6= -5.4835.

So pOH=5.4835 → pH=14-5.4835=8.5165, approximately 8.52.

Ah! So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52. So option A is pH 4.26 and 8.52.

But in the options, option A is (4.26, 8.52).

Wait, but earlier, I calculated the 25% titration point as pH≈4.26. So option A has both values.

But looking back, when I thought of the 25% titration, I got pH≈4.26, and at equivalence, pH≈8.52. So option A is the one that matches.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the initial steps?

Wait, another approach for the equivalence point: at equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. The pH can be calculated using the formula for the pH of a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The formula is pH = pKa + 1/2 (pKa - pKw + pKa2?), no, wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the pH of the acetate ion in solution.

Wait, another way: the pH can be found using the formula for a weak base.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, and Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, the pH calculation would be based on the Kb and the concentration.

The same way as before, which gives pH around 8.52.

So, option A's equivalence point is 8.52.

But looking at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but in the 25% titration, I got 4.26, which is the first part.

So option A would match both.

But wait, my initial calculation for equivalence point was wrong because I miscalculated the square root. So the correct pH at equivalence is about 8.52.

So, the first part (25% titration) is about 4.26, and the equivalence point is 8.52. So option A.

But let me look at the other options to see if any match.

Option D is 4.57;6.92. That would be if the equivalence pH was around 6.92, which doesn't match.

Option B is 3.17;6.73 → doesn't match.

Option C:4.73 (which is pKa) and 7.00. But at equivalence, pH is higher than 7, so 7.00 doesn't make sense.

So only option A has the correct equivalence point.

Wait, but wait, let me think again about the 25% titration. Another way to think is that 25% of the acid has been neutralized, so the ratio of A^- to HA is 0.25 (since 25% has been converted).

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa + log(0.25) → pKa is 4.733. Log(0.25)=−0.602 → pH=4.733−0.602=4.131.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the actual concentrations, I got 4.256. Which is more accurate?

Hmmm. Let me think: when you have a buffer with a certain ratio, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives pH based on the ratio of concentrations, regardless of the actual concentrations, as long as the solution behaves ideally (which it does here since the concentrations are not too high).

So in this case, the buffer ratio is [A^-]/[HA] = (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3 ≈0.333. So log(0.333)=−0.477. So pH=4.733−0.477=4.256.

But according to the 25% neutralization, the buffer ratio should be 0.25 (since 25% of the acid is neutralized, so 1:3 ratio of A^- to HA). Wait, no. When 25% of the acid is neutralized, the ratio of A^- to HA is (0.25) : (0.75) → 1:3 → 0.333. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial understanding. So 25% of the acid is neutralized.

Wait, the initial moles of acid are 0.001. 25% of that is 0.00025. So moles of A^- are 0.00025, and HA is 0.00075. So the ratio is 0.00025/0.00075 = 1/3. So the log(1/3)=−0.477 → pH=4.733−0.477=4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's correct. So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.26.

So that matches option A.

Wait, but another approach: the 25% titration is when you've added a quarter of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence. So how does that translate into the buffer ratio?

Yes, I think it's correct as we've calculated.

So the equivalence point is 8.52, and the 25% is 4.26. So option A is correct. But wait, looking back at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52.

But wait, the initial setup: when you mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, you get 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. That part is correct.

Wait, but when you add 2.5 cm³ (25% of 10 cm³) of NaOH, the solution's volume is 42.5 cm³, so the concentrations are as we calculated. So the initial approach is correct.

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, looking back, another mistake: when you add 25% of the NaOH needed, the moles of NaOH are 0.00025. But the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. So when you add 2.5 cm³, the total volume is 42.5 cm³, and the moles are correct.

So the correct pH values would be 4.26 and 8.52, so option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. Initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume has been reached. The equivalence volume is calculated as:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}, \quad \text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

Thus, 25% of the equivalence volume is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added at 25% titration} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.0059}{0.0176} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base in water, with a \(K_b\) calculated as:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \(K_b\):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
[OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 4.26; 8.52**

ANSWER: A
