Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and I need to figure out the structure based on that. Then, the compound undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each of these signals could represent. Starting with the downfield region, the 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's usually indicative of an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm. So there's probably an aldehyde group in the molecule.

Next, looking at the aromatic region. The 6.98 ppm is a doublet (2H) and 6.51 ppm is another doublet (2H). These might correspond to a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, in a para-substituted aromatic compound, you get two doublets: one for the two protons ortho to the substituent, and another for the para positions. But wait, if the substituent is in the para position, the coupling would be between the two protons, so maybe each is a doublet. Alternatively, this could be a meta-substituted ring, but that usually leads to more complex splitting.

Wait, let me think again. For a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent would each be equivalent and each have a certain coupling. No, wait, wait. If you have a substituent at position 4 (para) on a benzene ring, the two adjacent positions (2 and 6) would each have a proton. These would be equivalent and each would couple with the neighboring protons. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene ring, but more specifically, maybe it's a meta-substituted ring. No, the splitting into two doublets for 2H each might suggest a para-substituted ring, maybe with another substituent elsewhere.

Alternatively, this could be a case where the molecule has a substituent that's causing the ring to split into two doublets for each pair of protons. Let me think of a structure that could cause this.

Another point: the 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad singlet suggests perhaps an enol proton or something that's exchanging quickly, like an -OH group or conjugated protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton that's part of an enol system. But wait, in the NMR, the chemical shift for a vinyl proton is usually around 5-6 ppm. Hmm, 6.27 is a bit higher but possible for an aromatic or conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. Since each H is a doublet, it suggests coupling with another set of two protons. So maybe a methylene group attached to something else, perhaps an oxygen. For example, OCH2CH2... but wait, the integration is 2H, so perhaps it's -OCH2- something.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group, a benzene ring with substituents, an -OCH2 group, and some additional protons.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

We have C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens. Here, X=0, N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=(10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation.

That could be: one ring (benzene, which is 3), an aldehyde (a double bond, that's another, so 4), and another double bond or ring. Wait, five degrees. Benzene is 3, aldehyde is 1 (as a double bond), so that leaves one more. Could be another double bond or a ring.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 is an aldehyde. The 6.98 and 6.51 could be part of a benzene ring. The 6.27 is perhaps another set of protons, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or part of a conjugated system. The 3.66 is OCH2, perhaps connected to another group.

Wait, another approach: the presence of NaNO2 and HCl
