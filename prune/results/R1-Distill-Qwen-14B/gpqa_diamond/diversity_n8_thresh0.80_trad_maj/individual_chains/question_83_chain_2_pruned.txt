Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Since we're mixing two solutions of the same volume, the total volume doubles. So the initial concentration after dilution would be half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Wait, let me check that. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). Oh wait, because both are 20 cm³, V1+V2 is 40, so M2 = (0.05 *20)/(40) = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's right.

Next, the titration part. The first part is at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. I think I need to find out how much NaOH is added at this point. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) initially: Molarity * Volume (L) = 0.025 M * 0.02 L = 0.0005 moles. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, yes. So 0.025 * 0.02 = 0.0005 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.0005 = 0.000125 mol of NaOH has reacted with the acetic acid. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid, this will neutralize 0.000125 mol of CH3COOH, producing 0.000125 mol of acetate (CH3COO^-).

So the remaining moles of acetic acid will be 0.0005 - 0.000125 = 0.000375 mol. And the moles of acetate will be 0.000125 mol.

Wait, but what about the total volume at this point? Because when we add NaOH, the volume increases. Hmm, this might complicate things. Because the initial solution is 40 cm³ (20 +20), and when we add 25% of the required NaOH volume, perhaps I should calculate the volume
