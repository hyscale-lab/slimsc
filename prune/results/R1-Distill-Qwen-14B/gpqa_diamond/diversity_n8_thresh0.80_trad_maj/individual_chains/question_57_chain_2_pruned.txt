Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is related to the differential cross-section. Oh right, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas.

The problem gives me the phase shifts for different angular momentum states. The phase shifts are δ₀ = 90 degrees, δ₁ = 67 degrees, δ₂ = 55 degrees, δ₃ = 30 degrees, and δ₄ =13 degrees. Oh, and we're told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess higher l values beyond l=4 don't contribute here.

Wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I think that the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) has a dependence on the phase shifts. From what I remember, the scattering amplitude for each partial wave is given by something like f_l(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * (something with spherical harmonics). Oh wait, but since we're along the incident direction, θ is zero degrees, right? Because in the lab frame, the incident beam is along, say, the z-axis, so the scattering angle θ = 0 would be along that same direction.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam would be when the angle θ is 180 degrees, because that's the opposite direction. Or wait, no. No, the incident beam is along the initial direction, say, the z-axis. When the electron scatters, the angle θ is measured from the incident direction. So if θ is zero, the electron isn't scattered at all, which is the forward direction. But in reality, in the forward direction, the scattering amplitude is the largest because that's where the wave is mostly going straight. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused about that.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0, which is the direction of the incident beam. So I should focus on that.

The general expression for the scattering amplitude is a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [
