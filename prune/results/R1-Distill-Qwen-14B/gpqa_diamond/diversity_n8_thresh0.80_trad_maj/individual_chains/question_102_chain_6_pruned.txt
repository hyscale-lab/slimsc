Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about a genetics experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and some fluorescent markers. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate by using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two coding regions, so they're probably using it to express both the ligand and the receptor under certain conditions.

The vector details: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which I remember is an internal ribosome entry siteâ€”so that allows for the expression of two proteins from a single mRNA, with the second one being expressed after the first via ribosome landing on the IRES.

Then, there are these stop cassettes. Between ligand and mCherry, it's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Wait, I think loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites used in Cre/lox recombination. So the idea is probably that the Cre will recombine at specific lox sites, allowing the stop cassettes to be removed, thereby allowing expression of the downstream genes.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture, and used antibodies for Western blot. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, right? So the Cre is likely to be active in neural crest cells or their derivatives.

The problem is that when they look under the confocal, they don't see a green signal. The green would be from eGFP on the receptor. So why aren't they seeing it?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but that doesn't directly explain the lack of GFP expression in the transfected cells. Unless the construct isn't expressing, but I don't see how this option explains the Western blot result or the lack of GFP.

B) Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficking correctly, it wouldn't fluoresce. But why would the Western blot show it? If the protein is made but not secreted, maybe. But how would the Western detect it? Unless the blot is in the cytoplasm. But I'm not sure.

C) The enhancer for expression is missing. Wait, the CBA promoter is for the ligand, I think. The receptor's expression is under the IRES, which doesn't require a promoter but uses the ribosome. So maybe the enhancer is missing for the receptor? Or for the ligand? If the enhancer is missing, maybe the ligand isn't expressed, but how does that affect the receptor? Wait, the vector's design: the ligand is first, under CBA, then the IRES for the receptor. So if the CBA promoter isn't working, the ligand isn't expressed. But the question is about the receptor's eGFP not showing up. If the IRES isn't working, the receptor might not be expressed. But I'm not sure.

D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, then the eGFP might not be properly expressed, or the receptor might not be. Wait, but I'm thinking about the way the construct is made. The receptor is at the 3' end, so maybe the IRES is for the receptor's expression. If the eGFP is in a separate ORF, then the frame shouldn't matter because they are separate. Unless there's a translational readthrough. But I'm not exactly sure how the IRES and ORF fusions work.

Wait, the design: The vector is bicistronic. The first ORF is ligand with mCherry, then IRES, then receptor with eGFP. The stop cassettes are in between. So for the ligand, the stop is loxP, and for the receptor, it's lox2272. They probably used Cre to delete the stop cassettes so that the ligand and receptor can be expressed.

But in this case, they used SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, so the Cre would recombine at the lox sites. So, in the neural crest cells, the stops would be removed, allowing expression of both ligand and receptor.

But after crossing, they don't see GFP. So maybe the Cre isn't working correctly, or the construct isn't recombining. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Wait, but the initial question is about the mouse model. They made a mouse that's homozygous for the construct, so presumably the construct is in the genome. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would cause the lox sites to recombine, removing the stop cassettes.

If the stops are correctly removed, the ligand and receptor should be expressed. Then, the mCherry and eGFP should be expressed. So in the offspring, which are presumably expressing Cre under SOX10, the constructs would be active.

But they don't see eGFP. So maybe the IRES isn't working. Because the ligand is under CBA, which
