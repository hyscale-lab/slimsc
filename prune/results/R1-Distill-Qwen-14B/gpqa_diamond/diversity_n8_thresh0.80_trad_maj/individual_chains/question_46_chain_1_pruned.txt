Okay, so I have this problem where racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to figure out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let's think this through.

First, let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2 because it's pent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, right? But with a methyl branch at C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule is CH2=CH–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3? Wait, I'm getting confused. No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So numbering from the double bond, which is at position 1, so:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5
Structure: CH2=CH–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH3? Wait, that can't be because if it's pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CH–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3. Wait, but wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. Yes,
