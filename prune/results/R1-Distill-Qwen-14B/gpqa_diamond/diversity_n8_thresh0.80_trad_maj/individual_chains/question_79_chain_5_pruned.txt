Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to figure out what X was.

Wait, the reaction conditions: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? It's commonly used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh, wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh, right! Epoxides can be opened by nucleophiles. But wait, the solvent is nonpolar. Hmm, sometimes these conditions are used for ring-opening of epoxides via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, but wait, in nonpolar solvents, maybe it's a different scenario. Or perhaps it's an elimination reaction? Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening with a base. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is a strong, bulky base, so perhaps it's used for deprotonation, leading to ring-opening of the epoxide?

Wait, but if X is the starting material, and the product's NMR is given, maybe the reaction is an epoxidation? Or is X an epoxide and it's undergoing some reaction? Hmm, no, wait, wait. Let me think. The product has a certain structure, and the starting material is something else that reacts to form this product.

Wait, the product's NMR is given, so I need to figure out the structure of the product and then backtrack to find X. Because the question is asking for X, the starting material.

So the product's 1H NMR is:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

And the 13C NMR has a lot of signals, but I'll have to see the integration. Let me list them.

1H NMR:
- 2.28 and 2.31 are two singlets, each 3H. So two methyl groups, probably attached to something that doesn't cause splitting.
- The aromatic region: 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). So that's a total of 1+2+1+2 =6H. Wait, but wait, wait, 1H, 2H, 1H, 2H. So maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring, where one substituent is a substituent that causes a doublet of 2H, another substituent causing another doublet, and perhaps some coupling across. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted styrene or something like that.

Wait, let's map the aromatic signals. The 6.75 is a doublet, perhaps a proton adjacent to two others. Alternatively, let's think about a structure where two substituents are in the para positions. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group attached to a substituent.

Wait, the product is the result of a reaction between X and 1,4-diazabicyclooctane. So perhaps X is an epoxide and the reaction is ring-opening. Or perhaps X has a double bond and the reaction is an epoxidation.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. So molecular formula is C11H12O. If X is an epoxide, then its structure would have an oxygen in a three-membered ring. For example, styrene oxide would be an epoxide derived from styrene, but that's C8H8O. Hmm, but X is C11H12O, which is larger. So perhaps X is a substituted epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe X is an epoxide plus some substituents. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Wait, oxirane is another name for epoxide. So that's an epoxide attached to a styryl group. So styryl is a vinyl benzene group. So option A is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, which would be an epoxide where one of the oxygens is attached to a styryl group that has a methyl in the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So that's an epoxide where one oxygen is attached to a propenyl group that's substituted with a phenyl. So like a substituted allyl group with a phenyl group attached to the middle carbon.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So another epoxide, but the substituents are different. The oxirane ring has a methyl on carbon 2 and a styryl group on carbon 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide is attached to a styryl group (vinyl benzene) on the 2 position.

Wait, but the product's NMR is that of a compound that's the result of the reaction. So perhaps the product is an epoxide that was opened? Or perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation.

Wait, the reaction conditions: 1,4-diazabicyclooctane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K. I think that's a Swern oxidation condition, but no, Swern uses oxalyl chloride and then a base. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Wait, the base could be causing deprotonation, leading to an attack on the epoxide. Wait, but if X is an epoxide, then after reaction with the base, it would open. But the product's NMR shows an epoxide, perhaps?

Wait, in the 13C NMR, I see a signal at δ 197.7, which is quite high. That might be a carbonyl group. Wait, but epoxides don't have carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps an ester or ketone? Hmm, but the starting material has an oxygen, so maybe the product is an epoxide.

Wait, no, the product is from X reacting with the base. Let me think again. The reaction is X with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane (a base) in a nonpolar solvent. So, perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. For example, if X is an epoxide, the base could open it. But then, the product would have something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, but the product has a 197.7 ppm carbon. What's that? That’s a very deshielded carbon. Maybe a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. Hmm, but let's check the molecular formula. The product would have the same number of carbons as X, unless some groups are lost. But if X is C11H12O, and the product is from a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane (which is C8H16N2), but perhaps it's a neutral reaction. Wait, but
