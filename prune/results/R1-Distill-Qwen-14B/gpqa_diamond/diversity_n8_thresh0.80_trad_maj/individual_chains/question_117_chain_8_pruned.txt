Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they aren't superimposable on their mirror images. These compounds are said to be chiral and can rotate plane-polarized light, hence the term optical isomers.

The question gives four moieties, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
Hmm. Biphenyl compounds can have different isomerism possibilities. The [1,1'-biphenyl] part suggests that the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 position of each. Now, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, but biphenyls can have two types of isomerism: geometric (cis-trans) if there's a double bond, but in this case, the connection is single bond. So maybe it's about the arrangement of substituents around the bond. But wait, can a biphenyl have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it might not be chiral.

Wait, the molecule has nitro groups on the 6 positions of each ring (so in the meta position relative to the connecting bond) and carboxylate groups on the 2 positions (ortho to the connecting bond). So each ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Let me imagine the structure. The two benzene rings are connected at position 1, each with substituents at 2 and 6. So for each ring, the substituents are opposite each other? Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to position 1. So if the connecting bond is at position 1, then in each ring, 2 is adjacent, and 6 is across from that. So on each ring, substituents are at positions 2 and 6â€”so the nitro is at 6, which is para to the connecting bond, and the carboxylate is at 2, which is ortho.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. If the biphenyl has substituents in such a way that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, it can exhibit optical isomerism. For biphenyls, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it can be chiral.

Alternatively, if the molecule has a center of symmetry, then it isn't chiral. For example, if substituents on each ring mirror each other, then it's not chiral.

In this case, the substituents are 6-nitro and 2-carboxylate on each ring. So each ring has one nitro and one carboxylate. Are these substituents arranged symmetrically? Let me draw it mentally. The biphenyl is connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro at
