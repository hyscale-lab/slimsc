Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled into a solution of product 2 at -78°C, and then dimethylsulfide is added to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum. The options are various splitting patterns.

Hmm, I remember that when alkanes react with KOH, especially under high temperatures, elimination reactions can happen. Since we started with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, heating with a strong base like KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. So product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar, but wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. Oh, wait, elimination of two HBr molecules would form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene, specifically 1,3-adamantadiene or perhaps a bridge structure.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 is given. Let me look at that. The 1H NMR for product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. IR peaks around 1720 usually indicate carbonyl groups, like ketones or esters. Wait, but product 1 is formed from elimination, so perhaps it's an epoxide? No, wait, KOH is a base, maybe it's forming an epoxide? Or perhaps it's an elimination to form an alkene and maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxide? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Each Br is on a different carbon. When treated with KOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is probably dehydrohalogenation. Each Br would eliminate, so two HBr molecules are removed, forming a double bond between the two carbons. So product 1 should be 1,3-diene, but wait, I think the structure of adamantane has four bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgeheads. Eliminating two HBr would produce a conjugated diene in the adamantane structure. But wait, in adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are usually sp³ hybridized and not very flexible. Forming a double bond between bridgehead carbons might not be feasible due to angle strain. So maybe the elimination occurs in a way that doesn't involve the bridgeheads. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the Brs are on adjacent bridge carbons, and elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, another thought: when dihalides undergo elimination with a strong base, they form alkenes. So if 1
