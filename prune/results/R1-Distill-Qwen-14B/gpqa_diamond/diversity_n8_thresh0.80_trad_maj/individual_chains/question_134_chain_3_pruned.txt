Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The problem states: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but this is when a monoprotic acid reacts with a monobasic base. But here, we have different acids and a base, so I need to calculate the moles involved.

Wait, but wait. I think the first thing I need to do is figure out how much acid and base are present and which is in excess. Because if one is in excess, the neutralization will only go as far as the limiting reagent allows.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, find the moles of each acid and base.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole provides one H+ ion. The formula is HCl, so n = Molarity × Volume (L). So for HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 H+ ions. So the moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. So the moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the neutralization reaction is between H+ and OH- to form water. So I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- from each solution.

So total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol H+.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH-.

Now, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So 1:1 ratio.

So compare the moles of H+ and OH- to see which is the limiting reagent.

H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting reagent. That means all 0.2 mol OH- will react, and there will be excess H+ left.

So the amount of H2O formed is 0.2 mol H2O. Wait, but each H2O requires one H+ and one OH-, so yeah, 0.2 moles of H2O.

But wait, wait. Let me recheck. HCl gives 0.1 H+, H2SO4 gives 0.18 H+ → total 0.28. Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So OH- is less, so all OH- will react. The remaining H+ will be 0.08 mol.

So the neutralization reaction will proceed to use up 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH-.

The enthalpy change for this reaction can be calculated based on the moles of H2O formed. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the standard enthalpy is per mole of H+ neutralized. So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, it releases about 57 kJ.

But wait, no: The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form one mole of H2O. So per mole of H2O, it's about -57 kJ.

So in this case, the moles of H2O formed is 0.2. So the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the stoichiometry.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully ionized. H2SO4 is also strong, so it donates both H+ ions. So for 0.09 mol H2SO4, we get 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- will react, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options given are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the units.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so option B is about -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

Wait, 0.2 mol ×57 kJ/mol is 11.4 kJ, which is approximately -11.4 kJ. So that's about -11.4 kJ. But the options have D as -16 kJ, which is different. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid and see how much Ba(OH)2 is there.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the equivalents of acid and base.

For HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 equivalents (since each HCl gives one H+).

For H2SO4: 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 equivalents.

Total acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 equivalents.

Base is Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 equivalents.

So the acid has 0.28 equivalents, the base has 0.2. So the base is the limiting reagent, with 0.2 equivalents.

So the neutralization will proceed with 0.2 equivalents, which is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, producing 0.2 moles of H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.
