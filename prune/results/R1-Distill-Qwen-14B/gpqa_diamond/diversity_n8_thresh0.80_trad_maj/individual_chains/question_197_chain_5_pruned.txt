Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about identifying a final product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm given the IR and NMR data for Compound X, and I need to figure out what it is and what happens when it reacts under those conditions.

Hmm, the IR data shows strong absorption. Let's think about the peaks. The 3400–2500 cm-1 region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But in this case, since there's a 1720 cm-1 peak, that's more likely a carbonyl group. Wait, 1720 is around the range for esters, maybe a ketone? Or maybe an acid? Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is in the first peak. So the 3400–2500 might be the O-H from a carboxylic acid. But wait, 1720 is more like an ester or possibly a ketone. Hmm, but another peak at 1610 cm-1 suggests maybe conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Looking up, aromatic C=C stretching is around 1450-1600 cm-1. So the 1610 could be that. Also, the 1450 might be another aromatic peak or maybe a carbonyl in a conjugated system.

Now the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10. Also, carboxylic acids have O-H protons around 10-12, but they are usually broad. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like from an enol, but that's less likely. So perhaps this is a phenolic -OH? Wait, no, phenols are around 5-7 ppm. So maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Or another possibility: an aromatic proton adjacent to an electronegative group? Or maybe it's a ketone's alpha proton? Hmm, not sure yet.

Next peak: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets with 2H each suggest two sets of protons, each being two equivalent
