Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read through it again.

So, the question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Alright, let's break down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents is a big number. Maybe that's a clue about the stoichiometry. Bright red product... I'm thinking metals that form colored compounds. Copper maybe? Or maybe something like sulfur, but I'm not sure.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Oh, extremely hazardous makes me think of something like sarin gas, but probably not. Maybe something like phosgene? Or perhaps a very reactive compound, maybe a strong acid or a highly toxic gas.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. Strong and weak. Hmm... So maybe C is a sulfide or something that can hydrolyze into different acids.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include things like water, ethanol, maybe something like DMSO, or maybe a chloride solvent. Wait, but D and B react 1:1. D is a gas, B is a gas. So perhaps they form something like HCl? Or another acid or base. But H is a solvent, so maybe H2O if B is H2O, but that doesn't fit because B is a gas in the first reaction.

Wait, let me think again. Let's try to figure out what each compound could be.

Looking at the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). If B is a gas, perhaps O2, but wait, 8 equivalents? Wait, 8 B per A? Maybe B is O2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when a metal reacts with O2 in a certain ratio, it forms a particular oxide. For example, copper can form CuO (1:1) or CuO is black. Wait, but the product C is bright red. Hmm, maybe it's a sulfide? Like CuS? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is something else.

Wait, in the third reaction, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So C is probably a salt. Wait, when a salt reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into an acid and a base, but here it's producing two acids. Oh, wait, unless it's producing two different acids. So maybe C is a metal sulfide, which when hydrolyzed forms a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, for example, if C is FeS, hydrolysis would give Fe(OH)3 and H2S? But that's two different things. Or maybe it's a different sulfide. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a sulf
