Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH, and finding the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. Hmm.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the initial volume is 40 cm³. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I need to figure out what the concentrations are after dilution. So, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial moles of acetic acid would be volume times concentration. So, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So, moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles/volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Next, I need to find the pH at 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? Oh, right, 25% of the equivalence point. So I should calculate how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point, then take a quarter of that volume.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they react in a 1:1 ratio. So, moles of acetic acid are 0.001, so moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, at equivalence point, we add 10 cm³ of NaOH. 

At 25% titration, we're adding 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So, the volume added is 2.5 cm³. 

Now, when we add NaOH to the acetic acid solution, it will neutralize some of the acid, producing acetate ions and water.

At 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, let's calculate the moles of NaOH added. 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. Moles of NaOH is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. 

Since the reaction is 1:1, this means 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. So, initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, so remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate ion produced will be 0.00025.

But wait, the total solution volume at this point is the initial diluted solution plus the added NaOH. The initial was 40 cm³, and we added 2.5 cm³, so total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations after reaction are:
[Acetic acid] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[Acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, I think I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here for the pH at this point. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1.85e-5 is about 1.85 x 10^-5. The log of 1.85
