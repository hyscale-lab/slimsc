Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. The options given are A to D with various concentrations.

Alright, so first, I think I need to find out the molarity of each of those salts in the solution. Then, figure out what's going on with the phosphate species in solution.

Wait, both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are phosphate salts. I remember that these are related to the different protonation states of phosphate. H3PO4 can lose protons to form H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Specifically, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When it dissolves in water, I think it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, I believe it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, plus the water of course, but since it's already hydrated, maybe those are just spectator ions and the main point is the HPO4^2-.

Wait, but H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. So the first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3). The second is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). The third is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12). 

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. I think these can interconvert based on the pH of the solution. So the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-? Wait, no, the orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it's deprotonated, the
