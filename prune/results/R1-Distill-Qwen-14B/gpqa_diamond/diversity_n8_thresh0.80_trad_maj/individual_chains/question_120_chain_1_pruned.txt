Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, uniform distribution, right? I remember that in astronomy, parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d), so p ≈ 1/d in parsecs, I think. But wait, I'm not entirely sure, maybe it's p = 1/d or d = 1/p? Let me think. Oh right, parallax is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is the reciprocal. So d = 1/p, that makes sense.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does the number of stars per unit plx change with plx? The options are 1 over plx to some power.

I think I need to model this. Let's see, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density is constant. So, the number should depend on the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance.

The volume of a spherical shell between distance d and d + dd is (4π/3)( (d+dd)^3 - d^3 ). For small dd, this approximates to 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But wait, the question is about number per unit parallax. Parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let me substitute that. So d = 1/p, and dd would be something in terms of dp. Let's see, because d = 1/p → when p changes by dp, d changes by dd = - (1/p²) dp. But when dealing with positive increments, maybe I can relate the thickness in d to the thickness in p. Hmm, perhaps I should express the volume in terms of p.

So, the volume element in terms of p would be 4πd² dd = 4π (1/p²) dd. But dd is related to dp. Let's compute that. Since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, but when p increases, d decreases. So the shell's thickness in d is negative, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps I can take the absolute value. So, the volume element becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp, because dd = (1/p²) dp in magnitude? Wait, no. Let me think again. If d = 1/p, then dp = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² dp. So, substituting, the volume element becomes 4π d² dd = 4π d² (- d² dp) ) → but that would be negative, but since we're considering the magnitude, we can ignore the negative sign.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's write everything in terms of p.

d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp → but when p increases, d decreases, so to get the thickness in d terms, we have dd = - (1/p²) dp → so the volume element is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * ( - 1/p² dp ) = -4π (1/p^4) dp. Since dp is positive if p increases, but the volume would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I should take the absolute value. So the volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The volume element in terms of d is 4π d² dd. So, in terms of p, since d = 1/p, the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * ( - (1/p^2) dp ). So, substituting, the volume is 4π (1/p²) * ( -1/p² dp ) = -4π (1/p^4) dp. But the negative sign just indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but the absolute value is what we want for the number of stars. So the number of stars in a small change in p is n * volume. So the number per unit p is (n * 4π (1/p^4) ) * (dp). So the number per unit p (differential) would be proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit parallax interval is the number density multiplied by the volume element in terms of p. So, the number N in a small dp is N = n *
