Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound based on its NMR data after a reaction. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they give the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. I need to figure out what compound X was from the options given.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait, no, Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides? Or wait, no, maybe it's more about the conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms an epoxide. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually the base used in the epoxidation reaction, perhaps like the Prilezhaev oxidation? Or maybe it's used as a base in an epoxide ring-opening or something else. Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction details.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is known as DBU, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed process, but with DBU, so perhaps it's a base-catalyzed reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in epoxide formation. Wait, but how does DBU fit into that?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed epoxidation, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think about what the product's NMR tells me. Let's look at the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

The signals are:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ7.08 (2H, d)
- δ7.68 (1H, d)
- δ7.71 (2H, d)

The 13C NMR:
δ 21.3 (1C, s)
28.4 (1C, s)
126.9 (2C, s)
127.1 (1C, s)
129.1 (2C, s)
130.3 (1C, s)
141.5 (1C, s)
144.1 (1C, s)
197.7 (1C, s)

Hmm, okay. Let me try to interpret this.

First, the 1H NMR. Two singlets at around 2.3 ppm, each integrating to 3H. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signal. Maybe they're attached to oxygen or another quaternary center.

Then, the aromatic region. The signals are a doublet at 6.75 (1H), then two doublets at 7.08 (2H) and 7.68 (1H), and another at 7.71 (2H). That's a bit confusing. Wait, let me think of a pattern. Maybe it's an ABX system or something like a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents causing splitting.

Wait, let me consider the coupling. The 6.75 (1H, d) could be a proton that's coupled to one other proton. The 7.08 (2H, d) suggests two protons that are each coupled to one proton, perhaps as a para-substituted group. The 7.68 (1H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) could be another set of substituents, maybe in a meta or para position.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic region is a styryl group. Styryl groups have a conjugated double bond attached to a benzene ring. So maybe the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that's a double bond, like CH2=CHPh or similar.

Wait, but looking at the 13C NMR:

198 ppm is a strong indicator. That's a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone or an ester, but wait, 197.7 is more likely a carbonyl in a carbonyl group like a ketone. Wait, but wait, epoxide rings have carbons that are attached to oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but the product after reaction with DBU could be an epoxide. So, compound X might have been an alkene, and the reaction forms an epoxide. So, perhaps in the product, the NMR shows an epoxide.

Wait, but looking at the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7. That doesn't look like an epoxide carbon. Hmm. Epoxide carbons are usually around 50-70 ppm or so. Wait, maybe I'm mistaken. Wait, let me think: epoxide carbons are typically deshielded because of the ring strain, so their chemical shifts are upfield compared to alkenes. Wait, no, wait, no: I think in 13C NMR, the carbons adjacent to oxygen (like in epoxides) are usually around 50-60 ppm. So 197.7 is way higher. That's more like a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester.

Wait, but wait, if the product is an epoxide, where is that carbonyl from? Hmm, maybe the reaction isn't forming an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an
