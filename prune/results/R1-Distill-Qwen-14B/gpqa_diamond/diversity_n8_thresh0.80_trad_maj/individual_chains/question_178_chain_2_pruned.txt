Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I remember that γ matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices in the spinor representation.

Wait, but wait. The mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important because the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since the action is dimensionless, being integrated over spacetime). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because the integral of [Lagrangian] over four dimensions (d^4x) gives something dimensionless. Oh wait, no, wait. The Lagrangian density itself has mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over four dimensions, the integral's dimension must be zero. So each term must have mass dimension 4.

So to find the dimension of κ, I need to find the dimensions of each part of the term and see how they contribute.

Let's break down each part:

1. ψ̄ (the adjoint spinor): I think spinors have mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac Lagrangian is something like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, and each derivative has dimension 1. So, ψ̄ has [ψ̄] = 3/2, ψ is same. Then, ψ̄ γ μ ∂_mu ψ would be (3/2)*2 + 1 = 4, which fits.

2. σ_{μν}: It's (i/2) [γ_mu, γ_nu]. Since each γ is dimensionless, σ is dimensionless as well.

3. F^{μν}: That's the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar. The field tensor F is made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 (since the kinetic term for A is (∂A)^2, which has dimension 4, so each ∂A is dimension 2. Wait, wait. No, the term would be like (∂A)^2 which would have dimension (1 + 1) * 2 = 4. So each derivative has dimension 1, each A has dimension 1. So F^{μν} is ∂_μ A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So F has dimension 2. Because each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so each term in F is dimension 2.

Putting it all together. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me write out the dimensions:

Each ψ̄ and ψ contributes 3/2 each. So 3/2 * 2 = 3. σ is dimensionless,
