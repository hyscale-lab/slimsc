Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds have the ability to rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds show optical isomerism.

The question lists four moieties, and the options are combinations of them. Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, the structure here has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. Wait, so each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate group. But the question is about stereoisomerism. So, can this structure have chiral centers?

Wait, the biphenyl group. Each ring is connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents on each ring are at 6 and 2 positions. Let me visualize this. The central bond is single, so the two rings can rotate relative to each other. But for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some other form of asymmetry. Are there any chiral centers here?

Looking at the substituents on the biphenyl, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester. Wait, the carboxylate ester is OMe group. Each ring has two substituents—so the substituents are in positions 2 and 6. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the rings are substituted at positions 2 and 6 on each, with the same substituents on each ring. 

Wait, but the biphenyl linkage might allow for some kind of stereoisomerism. Wait, if the two rings are connected, can they have enantiomeric forms? That depends on whether the substituents create a chiral plane around the central bond. Oh, wait, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then no. But if the arrangement is such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, perhaps it can have enantiomers.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the biphenyl could have some kind of axial chirality. Axial chirality refers to the arrangement of substituents around a central axis, like in binaphthyl compounds. For example, BINOL has axial chirality because the two naphthyl groups are connected in such a way that they can't be superimposed on their mirror image.

But in this case, the substituents are on the biphenyl. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Are the substituents arranged symmetrically? Let me think. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Because the rings are connected at 1 and 1', the positions 2 and 6 are across from each other. If both rings have the same substituents (nitro and carboxylate) at 2 and 6 positions, does that create a plane of symmetry? Hmm.

If both rings are identical in substitution, then perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. But wait, the substituents are in the same positions on each ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. So when connected via a single bond, can the substituents on each ring be arranged in a way that leads to a lack of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the arrangement leads to axial chirality. For example, if the two substituents on each ring are arranged such that their positions are not mirror images, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, maybe I should think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers. Let's look for any carbon atoms with four different substituents. The ester groups (OCH3) are on each ring—so the carbons attached to the oxygen in the ester would be connected to the benzene
