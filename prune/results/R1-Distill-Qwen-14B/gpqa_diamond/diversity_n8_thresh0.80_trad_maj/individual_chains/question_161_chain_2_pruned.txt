Okay, so I just came across this electron microscopy question, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about the mean free path of gas molecules in a transmission electron microscope's sample compartment. Mike created an ultra-high vacuum, but some gas particles are still present. Initially, the mean free path is λ1. Then, when he turns on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is about the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

First, I need to recall what the mean free path (MFP) is. The MFP is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, with lower pressure, the MFP increases because molecules don't collide as often. So higher MFP means the gas is less dense, which makes sense for ultra-high vacuum.

In this scenario, Mike's setup uses a high accelerating voltage (1000 kV), so it's a high-resolution TEM. The vacuum is really good, less than 1e-9 Torr, but some gas remains. The MFP is λ1 under these conditions.

Now, when he starts the electron beam, the MFP becomes λ2. Why would that change? The temperature is the same, so that factor (like thermal motion) shouldn't affect the MFP. But wait, the electron beam might interact with the gas molecules.

I remember that electron scattering can cause gas molecules to move. When the electron beam is on, it can cause electrons to collide with the gas molecules more frequently. Because the electrons are high-energy (1000 kV is 1 MV, so electrons are moving really fast), they can ionize the gas molecules or cause them to move. This might increase the effective number of collisions the gas molecules have, thus changing the MFP.

Wait, but the MFP equation depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where d is the mean collision diameter, P is pressure, and T is temperature. Oh wait, or another version: λ = 1/(nσ√2), where n is number density and σ is the collision cross-section.

So if the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize or perhaps increase their velocity, maybe their number density increases. Wait, no, the pressure was already measured. Or maybe the electron beam causes more ionization, leading to charged particles which are more likely to be affected by the electric fields in the microscope, thus being accelerated and perhaps leaving the sample compartment. Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be more likely to collide with other molecules.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it can cause electrons to be scattered by gas molecules, leading to more frequent collisions. So the effective number of collisions would increase, which would decrease the mean free path.

Wait, but wait. The MFP is calculated based on molecular collisions. The electron beam introduces another factor: electron-molecule interactions. These interactions can cause the gas molecules to move more, perhaps increasing their effective speed or causing more frequent interactions.

So if the gas molecules are being hit by electrons, they might gain energy and move faster. Faster-moving molecules would have shorter mean free paths because they collide more often. Or wait, no, if they're moving faster, the time between collisions might be shorter, meaning the MFP would be shorter.

Wait, the MFP is inversely proportional to the number density and the collision cross-section. If the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize or break apart, then perhaps the number of gas particles increases, but that seems unlikely because the pressure is already so low.

Alternatively, the electrons hitting the gas molecules might cause them to be more likely to collide with each other. Because when a gas molecule is hit by an electron, it could gain enough energy to break apart or become a charged particle, but in a ultra-high vacuum, maybe the gas is mostly neutral. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the walls of the chamber. But the sample compartment is under vacuum, so if gas molecules are energized, they might have a higher chance of being pumped out or hitting the walls, thus leaving the system. But that would decrease the number of gas particles, which would increase the MFP.

But wait, the initial MFP is λ1. If the MFP is now
