Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's like a cage-like molecule with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The starting material has bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and heating with it usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, but I also recall that when two adjacent bromines are present, especially in a structure like adamantane, heating with KOH might lead to ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement. Or maybe it's a double elimination forming an alkene.

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which I think is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but the starting material is di-bromo-adamantane. If two eliminations occur, each elimination forms a double bond. Wait, but two eliminations would require two H's being abstracted. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is eliminated, each forming an alkene. Wait, but in adamantane, the positions are such that maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons, so eliminating both could form a diene? But wait, the IR peak is at 1720 cm^-1, which is more like a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's not elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility is that the base causes a substitution. But with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double substitution. But substitution usually isn't the main reaction when you have strong base and heat; elimination is more likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. That region often suggests an ether or an alcohol. But wait, with KOH, perhaps it's an epoxide? Or maybe an elimination product with an oxygen somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that would have a different NMR.

Wait, another thought: If two Br atoms are adjacent, heating with KOH could lead to the formation of an epoxide. Because if each Br is on adjacent carbons, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming an epoxide ring. Epoxides typically have protons around 3-4 ppm, but wait, product 1's NMR has 4.79 (2H) as a singlet. That's a bit higher than typical epoxide protons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that seems less likely. Or perhaps it's a ketone. Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe after elimination, a ketone is formed.

Wait, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to each other, when KOH removes each Br, perhaps it abstracts a hydrogen from each
