Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're trying to understand their developmental fate. The setup involves some vectors and experiments.

First, the vectors. They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one vector, right? So, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. Oh, right, IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can function as a promoter for the second gene in a bicistronic vector. So the ligand is expressed from CBA, and the receptor from IRES.

But then there are stop cassettes. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Hmm, I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. loxP contains a stop cassette, so when Cre is present, it can excise the stop, allowing the gene to be expressed.

So, when you have a loxP site before a stop, perhaps in the ligand's case, if Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. But wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry. Oh, wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. So mCherry is a fluorescent tag, probably as a reporter for the ligand's expression.

Similarly, the receptor has an IRES upstream, then its ORF, then a stop with lox2272. eGFP is at the C-terminus. So if Cre is present, the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP would be removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed.

But wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So, I think this setup is for conditional expression. Maybe the Cre is used to excise certain regions, allowing the expression of the ligand and receptor together.

Now, they transfected primary astrocyte cultures with this plasmid and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins to check Western blot. Actin loading is proportional, so that's a control for protein loading. So, they're checking if the ligand and receptor are being expressed.

Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, like Schwann cells and some glial cells. SOX10-Cre would drive recombination in those cells.

After the offspring is born, they visualize under confocal. They expected to see a green signal (eGFP), but didn't. The question is why.

Looking at the
