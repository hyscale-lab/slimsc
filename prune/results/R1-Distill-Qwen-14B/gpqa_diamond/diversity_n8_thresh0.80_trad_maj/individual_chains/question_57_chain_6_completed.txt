Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that term from my studies. It involves electrons bouncing off nuclei without losing energy, right? The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, phase shifts in scattering... Oh right! Scattering amplitude is a concept from quantum mechanics. The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be written in terms of the phase shifts δ_l. I think the formula is something like f(θ, φ) = (sum over l) [ ( (2l+1) * (sin δ_l) ) / ( (2j+1) ) ) * e^{iδ_l} ] ... but wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe it's f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * (something with Legendre polynomials). Oh wait, I think the general form is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ), but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the question specifies that the scattering is along the incident beam direction, which I think is θ = 0 degrees because the beam is the direction of the incoming particle. So theta is zero, which would mean that cosθ is 1. So each P_l(1) term would be 1, because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for any l. Oh wait, that's correct because P_l(1) is indeed 1 for all l. So the sum reduces to summing over l terms of (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1).

But wait, the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(θ=0)]. 

Hmm, let's think about the formula again. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1]

Where k is the wave number of the electrons. Oh, right, because we're dealing with electrons, we need to calculate k using their energy. The energy is given as 50 MeV. 

Wait, how to find k. The energy of the electron is E = 50 MeV, which is kinetic. Since the mass of the electron is much smaller than the energy, perhaps we can use relativistic expressions. Wait, but for non-relativistic electrons, E = p²/(2m), but 50 MeV is way higher than the rest mass (about 0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are important. Hmm, but maybe the problem expects us to use the non-relativistic formula. Or perhaps we can find the momentum p, then get k = p/ħ.

Wait, sorry, for electrons, the momentum p is related to the energy. The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 ). But since E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than mc^2, we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E/(c). 

Wait, but units are a bit tricky here. Let me think: E is given in MeV, which is 1e6 eV. Planck's constant ħ is about 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħc ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm). So using E in MeV, and ħ in MeV·fm, we can find k.

Wait, so k = p/ħ. Because the wave number k is p divided by ħ. Since p is in units of MeV/c (from E≈pc), and ħ is in MeV·fm, so let's compute p.

Wait, from E ≈ pc (since E is much larger than mc^2), p = E/(c). But E is in MeV, and c is in units that make E/c in units of MeV/(c), but when you divide by ħ (MeV·fm), you get (MeV/(c)) ) / (MeV·fm) ) = 1/(fm c) ?

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. Then E (in MeV) is equal to p (in MeV/c) multiplied by c, so p = E (MeV) / c. But perhaps it's easier to compute k in units compatible with the given data.

The wave number k is given by k = p/ħ. But ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm. So let me compute p. For E=50 MeV, we have p ≈ E/c (relativistic). But in natural units, c=1, so p=50 MeV.

Wait, but in that case, k = p/ħ = (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute that: 50 / 197.33 is approx 0.253. So k ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but the units of k should be inverse femtometers, right? Because ħ has units of MeV·fm.

So k = p/ħ = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (c) )? Wait, no, because in the expression, p is in units MeV/c, and ħ is in MeV·fm. So (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) = 1/(fm c). Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, perhaps I should think in terms of E = ħ c k. Because for a free particle, E = ħ k. Wait, but only if the units are set correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is E = ħ c k. Because in natural units, ħ c is in units of MeV·fm, and k is 1/fm, so E = (MeV·fm) * (1/fm) )= MeV, which works.

So E = ħ c k → k = E/(ħ c). Wait, but ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm, so k = E / (ħ c) → which would be 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm ) → 50/(197.33) 1/fm → approximately 0.253 fm^-1. So that's correct.

Okay, so k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Now, back to the scattering amplitude. So f(θ=0) is (1/(2ik)) sum_{l} (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ]

But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond the given ones. Wait, the given phase shifts are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. So l goes from 0 to 4, inclusive. So we sum for l=0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, but what is the expression for the imaginary part of f(θ=0). Let's compute f(θ=0) as:

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ]

Let me compute each term (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1). Then sum them all, multiply by 1/(2ik), and take the imaginary part.

So let's compute each term step by step.

But wait, δ_l is given in degrees, so I need to convert them to radians to compute e^{iθ} correctly.

Wait, because e^{iθ} uses θ in radians. So for each δ_l, I'll convert degrees to radians.

So let's make a table:

l | δ_l (degrees) | δ_l (radians) | 2 δ_l (radians) | e^{2i δ_l} -1 | (2l+1) * [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] | Imaginary part of that term
---|-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------
0 | 90          | π/2           | π               | e^{iπ} -1 = (-1) -1 = -2 | 1 * (-2) = -2 | Im(-2) = 0? Wait, because e^{iπ} is -1, so e^{i2π*0.5} is i, wait wait wait, no, wait. Hold on. Wait, δ_l is the phase shift, and in the formula, it's e^{2i δ_l}.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. For l=0, δ0=90°, which is π/2 radians. Then 2 δ0 = π radians. So e^{i 2δ0} = e^{iπ} = -1.

So e^{2i δ0} = -1. So e^{2i δ0} - 1 = (-1) - 1 = -2.

So the term for l=0 is (2*0 +1) * (-2) = 1*(-2) = -2.

Imaginary part of this term is Im(-2) = 0, since it's a real number.

Hmm, but wait, no. Wait, the term (2l+1) times (e^{2i δ_l} -1). So e^{2i δ_l} is a complex number, so (e^{2i δ_l} -1) is also a complex number. So when I compute (2l+1) multiplied by this, I get a complex number, whose real and imaginary parts contribute to the overall sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) term as a complex number, then multiply by (2l+1), then sum all terms, then multiply by 1/(2ik), and then take the imaginary part.

So let me proceed step by step.

Compute for each l:

l=0: δ0=90° → π/2 radians.
2δ0= π → e^{i π} = -1 → e^{i2δ0} -1 = -1 -1 = -2. So (2l+1)=1, term is (-2). So real part is -2, imaginary part 0.

l=1: δ1=67° → convert to radians: 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.16937 radians. 2δ1 ≈ 2.33874 radians.
e^{i 2.33874} → cos(2.33874) + i sin(2.33874). Let me compute that:

cos(2.33874) ≈ -0.68. sin(2.33874) ≈ 0.732. So e^{i 2.33874} ≈ -0.68 + i 0.732.

So e^{i2δ1} - 1 = (-0.68 -1) + i 0.732 = (-1.68) + i 0.732.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3: 3*(-1.68) + i 3*(0.732) → -5.04 + i 2.196.

So the imaginary part of this term is 2.196.

Wait, but the overall term is (2l+1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) → which is a complex number, so when we sum all terms, each term contributes to the real and imaginary parts. Then f becomes [sum of (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1)] multiplied by 1/(2ik). But when taking the imaginary part, we need to consider the contributions from all terms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each term's real and imaginary parts, sum them all, then multiply by 1/(2ik), and then take the imaginary part of that.

So let me proceed for each l.

l=0:
δ0=90° → 2δ0=180° → e^{iπ} =-1 → e^{i2δ0} -1 = -2 → real part -2, imaginary part 0.
(2l+1)=1 → term is -2 → real: -2, imag:0.

l=1:
δ1=67° → 2δ1=134° → which is in radians 134 * π/180 ≈ 2.341 radians.

Compute e^{i2.341}:
cos(2.341) ≈ cos(134°) → cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈ -0.6947 → cos(2.341)≈-0.6947.
sin(2.341) ≈ sin(134°) = sin(46)≈0.7193 → so e^{i 2.341} ≈ -0.6947 + i 0.7193.
Thus, e^{i2δ1} -1 = (-0.6947 -1) + i 0.7193 = (-1.6947) + i 0.7193.

Multiply by (2l+1)=3 → (-1.6947 *3 ) + i (0.7193 *3) → -5.0841 + i 2.1579.

So for l=1, real part is -5.0841, imaginary part 2.1579.

l=2:
δ2=55° → 2δ2=110° → 110° in radians is 1.91986 radians.

Compute e^{i1.91986}.

cos(110°) ≈ cos(1.91986) ≈ -0.3420.
sin(110°) ≈ 0.9397.

So e^{i1.91986} ≈ -0.3420 + i 0.9397.
e^{i2δ2} -1 = (-0.3420 -1) + i 0.9397 → -1.3420 + i 0.9397.

Multiply by (2l+1)=5 → 5*(-1.3420) = -6.71, 5*(0.9397)=4.6985.

So term for l=2: real part -6.71, imaginary part 4.6985.

l=3:
δ3=30° → 2δ3=60°, which is π/3 ≈1.0472 radians.

e^{i1.0472} → cos(60°)=0.5, sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660. So e^{i60°} = 0.5 + i 0.8660.

e^{i2δ3} -1 = (0.5 -1) + i 0.8660 → (-0.5) + i 0.8660.

Multiply by (2l+1)=7 → 7*(-0.5)= -3.5; 7*(0.8660)=6.062.

So term for l=3: real part -3.5, imaginary part 6.062.

l=4:
δ4=13° → 2δ4=26° → 26° in radians is 0.4538 radians.

e^{i0.4538} → cos(26°)=0.8988, sin(26)=0.4384.

e^{i0.4538} ≈ 0.8988 + i 0.4384.

e^{i2δ4} -1 = (0.8988 -1) + i 0.4384 → (-0.1012) + i 0.4384.

Multiply by (2l+1)=9 → 9*(-0.1012) = -0.9108; 9*(0.4384)=3.9456.

So term for l=4: real part -0.9108, imaginary part 3.9456.

Now, sum all the real parts and imaginary parts:

Real parts sum:
l=0: -2
l=1: -5.0841 → total so far: -7.0841
l=2: -6.71 → total: -13.7941
l=3: -3.5 → total: -17.2941
l=4: -0.9108 → total: -18.2049

Imaginary parts sum:
l=0: 0
l=1: 2.1579
l=2: 4.6985 → total: 6.8564
l=3: 6.062 → total: 12.9184
l=4: 3.9456 → total: 16.864

So the sum of all terms is [ -18.2049 ] + i [ 16.864 ]

Then, f(θ=0) = (1/(2ik)) * (sum) → (1/(2ik)) * ( -18.2049 + i 16.864 )

Now, compute this.

First, 2ik = 2i * 0.253 fm^{-1} → 0.506 i fm^{-1}

So 1/(2ik) = 1/(0.506 i fm^{-1}) ) → which is (1/0.506) * (1/i ) * fm.

But 1/i = -i, because 1/i = -i. So,

1/(2ik) = (1/0.506) * (-i) * fm ≈ 1.976 * (-i) * fm.

So f = [ (-18.2049 + i 16.864 ) ] * ( -i 1.976 fm )

Let me compute this multiplication.

First, expand the product:

(-18.2049) * (-i 1.976) + (i 16.864) * (-i 1.976 )

Simplify each term:

First term: (18.2049 * 1.976 ) * i → Let's compute 18.2049 * 1.976 ≈ approx 36.02.

Wait, 18 * 2 is 36, so more accurately:

18.2049 × 1.976 ≈ let's compute:

18 * 1.976 = 35.568
0.2049 *1.976 ≈ 0.405
Total ≈ 35.568 + 0.405 = 35.973.

So first term is 35.973 i.

Second term: (i * -i ) = -i^2 = - (-1) =1. So the second term is 16.864 * 1.976 * 1.

Let me compute 16.864 *1.976.

16 *1.976 =31.616.

0.864 *1.976 ≈ approx 1.706.

So total is 31.616 +1.706 ≈33.322.

So the second term is 33.322.

So f = 35.973 i + 33.322.

So f = 33.322 + i 35.973.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck. Because when I multiply (A + i B) * (C + i D), it's:

A*C + i A D + i B C + i^2 B D → which becomes (A C - B D) + i (A D + B C).

But in our case, it's (sum) * (1/(2ik)).

Wait, perhaps I should think of the multiplication as:

sum = S = S_real + i S_imag.

So S * (1/(2ik)) = (S_real + i S_imag) * ( 1/(2ik) )

Earlier, I computed 1/(2ik) as (1.976) * (-i) fm.

So,

(S_real + i S_imag) * (-i 1.976 fm) = 1.976 fm [ (S_real)(-i) + i S_imag (-i) ]

= 1.976 fm [ -i S_real -i^2 S_imag ]

= 1.976 fm [ -i S_real + S_imag ]

Because i^2 is -1, so -i^2 is 1.

So,

= 1.976 fm [ S_imag + (-i S_real) ]

Which means,

The real part is 1.976 * S_imag fm,

The imaginary part is 1.976 * (- S_real ) fm.

So,

Real part: 1.976 * 16.864 fm → 1.976 *16.864 ≈ Let's compute 20 *16.864 ≈ 337.28, but 1.976 is slightly less than 2, so approx 33.32.

Imaginary part: 1.976 * (- (-18.2049 )) = 1.976 * 18.2049 → approx 36.02.

So f = (33.32 + i 36.02) fm.

But the question asks for the imaginary part of f along the incident beam direction, which is Im[f(θ=0)].

So Im[f] = 36.02 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them is around 36 fm. Let me check the options again:

Options:
A) 87163.4 fm
B) 355.351 fm
C) 177.675 fm
D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, none of these is near 36. So I must have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go back and see where I went wrong.

Wait a minute, I think I messed up the formula for the scattering amplitude. Because I'm pretty sure that the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is related to the total cross-section. The optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total = 4π |f|^2 /k^2, but wait, no, the imaginary part of f is linked to the total cross-section via Im f = (k/(4π)) * σ_total.

Wait, perhaps the approach I took is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the imaginary part as Im [ (sum (2l+1) e^{i 2 δ_l} ) ].

Wait, wait, another thought: maybe the correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along θ=0 is Im[f(θ=0)] = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Oh! Because when you expand e^{i2δ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l), so e^{i2δ_l} -1 = (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l).

So, the imaginary part of (2l+1)(e^{i2δ_l} -1 ) is (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

So, the sum of all (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) would be the sum for the imaginary part.

Then, the imaginary part of f(θ=0) is: (1/(2k)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

So perhaps I should have calculated it this way.

Let me redo this part.

So, Im[f(θ=0)] = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

That's a simpler approach. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach by not considering that the imaginary part of each (e^{i2δ} -1) term is (sin(2δ)).

So, for each l, compute (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l), sum them all, multiply by 1/(2k), and that gives the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

This seems more straightforward. So let's try this.

Compute each (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) term.

l=0: δ0=90° → 2δ0=180° → sin(180)=0. So term is 1*0=0.

l=1: δ1=67° → 2δ1=134° → sin(134) = sin(180-46)=sin(46) ≈ 0.7193. (2l+1)=3 → 3 * 0.7193 ≈ 2.1579.

l=2: δ2=55° → 2δ2=110° → sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397. (2l+1)=5 →5 * 0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: δ3=30° → 2δ3=60° → sin(60)=√3/2 ≈0.8660. (2l+1)=7 →7 * 0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ4=13° →2δ4=26° → sin(26)≈0.4384. (2l+1)=9 →9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum these values:

0 (l=0)
+ 2.1579 (l=1) → sum=2.1579
+4.6985 → sum=6.8564
+6.062 → sum=12.9184
+3.9456 → sum=16.864.

So sum =16.864.

Then, multiply by 1/(2k) → which is 1/(2 * 0.253 fm^{-1}) ) = 1/(0.506 fm^{-1}) ) = (1 / 0.506) * fm → ≈1.976 fm.

So, Im[f] = 16.864 * 1.976 fm ≈ let's compute 16.864 * 2 = 33.728, subtract 16.864 * 0.024 (since 0.506 is approx 0.5, and 2-0.506=1.494, but perhaps it's easier to compute 16.864 *1.976.

Wait, 16 *1.976 = 31.616.

0.864 *1.976 ≈ 1.706.

So total approx 31.616 +1.706=33.322 fm.

Wait, but the options don't have 33.3 fm. The closest option is C)177.675 fm, which is about 5.3 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me double-check that.

Earlier, I had E=50 MeV, and I used E=ħ c k → so k= E/(ħ c). But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = 50/197.33 (1/fm) ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

But wait, perhaps I confused MeV and MeV/c. Because E is 50 MeV, which is in units of energy, and p=E/c for relativistic particles.

Wait, let me think about the units again. The momentum p is E/(c) when E is much larger than the rest mass. So p = E/(c) → in units of MeV/c.

Then, k = p/ħ → so p is in MeV/c, ħ is in MeV·fm.

So, k = (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) = 1/(fm c) → but that's not correct, because units should be (1/fm) as k has units of 1/length.

Wait, perhaps I should express p in units of MeV/c. So,

p = E/(c) → E=50 MeV → p=50 MeV/c.

Then, ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = p/ħ → (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → the MeV units cancel, c is in units of fm per second? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write in terms of units where c=1, so that p is in MeV.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In natural units where ħ=1 and c=1, E (MeV) is equal to p (MeV). So, k = p/(ħ c) → but if ħ and c are set to 1, then k = p.

But when using SI-like units, perhaps we can write:

k = p / (ħ c) → but p is in units of MeV/c.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) ) → with ħ c=197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → units: (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) → (1/(c·fm)).

Wait, but c is in units of fm per some time unit? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute the numerical value:

k = 50 / (197.33) → approx 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's what I did before. So, 1/(2k) is 1/(2 * 0.253) = 1/0.506 ≈1.976 fm.

So sum is 16.864 → Im(f) = 16.864 * 1.976 ≈33.322 fm.

But the options don't have this value. The closest is option C) 177.675 fm, which is about 5.3 times higher.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)) ) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, I think I might have missed a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) )/(2ik) ) * P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1. So,

f(0,φ) = [ sum_{l} (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1) ]/(2ik) )

Then, f(0,φ) = [ sum (2l+1)(e^{2i δ_l} -1) ]/(2ik) )

The imaginary part is Im(f(0,φ)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]/(2k) ).

Wait, because (e^{iθ} -1) = e^{iθ/2} (e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2} ) = e^{iθ/2} * [ 2i sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, no, perhaps better to write:

e^{iθ} -1 = e^{iθ/2} [ e^{iθ/2} - e^{-iθ/2} ] = e^{iθ/2} * 2i sin(θ/2).

So, e^{iθ} -1 = 2i e^{iθ/2} sin(θ/2).

So, the imaginary part of (e^{iθ} -1) is Im(2i e^{iθ/2} sin(theta/2) ) = 2 sin(theta/2) * Im( i e^{i theta/2} )

Im( i e^{i theta/2} )= Im( i (cos(theta/2) + i sin(theta/2)) )= Im( i cos(theta/2) - sin(theta/2) )= cos(theta/2).

So, Im(e^{iθ} -1 ) = 2 sin(theta/2) * cos(theta/2) ) = sin(theta).

So, Im( e^{i theta} -1 ) = sin(theta).

Wait, but in our case, theta is 2 δ_l. So, the imaginary part of (e^{i 2δ_l} -1 ) is sin(2 δ_l).

Ah, so that's correct. So, the imaginary part of each term (2l+1)(e^{i 2δ_l} -1) is (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

So, the sum of all such terms is sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

So, Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

So, the calculation of the sum was correct, leading to 16.864.

But then, 16.864 * 1.976 fm ≈33.322 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is k = p/(ħ), not p/(ħ c). Because earlier, I thought E=ħ c k, so k=E/(ħ c) → but perhaps it's E=ħ k, which would give k=E/ħ.

Wait, this confusion arises from unit systems. Let me clarify.

The correct relativistic relation is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

For E much larger than m c^2, E≈p c → p ≈ E/(c).

Then, k = p/(ħ), because p = ħ k.

So, substituting p = E/(c), we have k = (E/(c)) / ħ = E/( ħ c ).

Yes, which is what I did earlier. So k = E/( ħ c ) → 50 MeV/(197.33 MeV fm) ) → 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that part seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Let me recheck the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l):

l=0: 1 * sin(180) = 0.

l=1:3 * sin(134) → sin(134)=sin(46)≈0.7193 → 3 * 0.7193 =2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 * 0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

So sum is 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456 = 16.864.

Hmm, that's correct.

So 16.864 * 1/(2*0.253) → 16.864 / 0.506 ≈33.322 fm.

Hmm, but the options are way off. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere in the unit conversion.

Wait, no. Because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters. But all the calculations are in fm, so perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, wait, let's think about what the scattering amplitude's units are. The scattering amplitude f has units of length, typically in fm.

So, the result I obtained is about 33.3 fm, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/k).

Because in the initial formula, f = [sum term ] / (2ik). So the imaginary part would be [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

Wait, but earlier I thought the imaginary part was [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

Yes, that's correct. So 16.864 * (1/(2*0.253)) → 16.864 / 0.506 ≈33.32 fm.

But the options don't have this. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(k)).

Because I might have made a mistake in the factor.

Wait, let me re-express the formula:

f = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{i2δ_l} -1 )

= (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1)(e^{i2δ_l} -1 ) ]

Each term is (2l+1)(e^{i2δ_l} -1 ) → which is (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So, the sum is [ sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l)-1 ) ] + i [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

So, f = (1/(2ik)) [ real_part + i * imaginary_part ]

= (1/(2ik)) real_part + (1/(2ik)) i imaginary_part.

= real_part/(2ik) + imaginary_part/(2k)

So, the imaginary part of f is (1/(2k)) * imaginary_part.

Which is (1/(2k)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So yes, that's correct. So I'm confident in that.

But I'm getting about 33.3 fm, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in a different way. Let me compute the momentum p more accurately.

E = 50 MeV, which is the kinetic energy. But wait, the problem states that the electrons are 50 MeV. Are they 50 MeV per electron, or 50 MeV total? No, it's the incident energy of 50 MeV electrons. So it's the kinetic energy, but for electrons, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger, so relativistic.

So, E = gamma m c^2.

But for high energies, E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/(c) → p = 50 MeV/c.

Yes.

Then, k = p/ħ → p is 50 MeV/c. ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → 50/(197.33) [1/(fm c) ].

Wait, but the units don't seem right. Because p is MeV/c, and ħ is MeV·fm, so (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) = 1/(fm c) → which is not 1/fm.

Wait, perhaps I should express ħ in units of MeV·fm/c. Because ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm, so ħ = (197.33 MeV·fm) / c.

So, k = p/(ħ) → p is in MeV/c, ħ is (197.33 MeV·fm) / c → so,

k = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV·fm) / c ) ] ] → the c terms cancel, and MeV cancels.

k = 50 / 197.33 (1/fm) → which is 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is 33.3 fm, but it's not an option, so I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) [something].

Wait, because in some texts, the scattering amplitude is written as f = sum (2l+1) (e^{2i δ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ) (sinθ/(1-cosθ))^l ... No, wait, that's for the partial waves. No, perhaps I'm confusing with the partial wave expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I have is correct, but there's a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, but I treated them as radians. Let me recheck that.

Yes, I converted the δ_l from degrees to radians, so that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-calculate the sum:

sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l):

l=0: 0

l=1:3 * sin(2*67°) = 3*sin(134°) → sin(134) is sin(46)=0.7193 → 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, correct.

So, 16.864 * (1/(2*0.253)) → 16.864/(0.506) ≈33.322 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts.

Wait, the phase shifts given are δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°.

But I used them all. Wait, perhaps the problem statement says to ignore rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4, but I think I included all given phase shifts.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

Wait, then, 1/k would be in units of fm, since k is in 1/fm.

Wait, let me re-express the formula.

I think the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

So, at θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)[ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ].

Thus, the imaginary part of f(0) is [ ∑ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

Which is what I calculated.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the magnitude, but the question clearly asks for the imaginary part. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option C) 177.675 fm. Which is about 5.3 times the value I obtained.

Wait, 33.322 *5.3≈177.675. Hmm, exactly! So perhaps I missed a factor of 5.3 somewhere.

Wait, where could that factor come from? Oh! Because I computed 1/(2k) as 1.976 fm, but perhaps I should have multiplied by something else.

Wait, wait, perhaps I forgot that 1/(2k) is in units of fm, but k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/k is in fm.

Wait, but 1/(2k) = 1/(2*0.253) =1.976, which is in fm.

So, 16.864 *1.976 fm → 33.322 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is exactly 33.322 *5.333.

Wait, 5.333 is 16/3. So perhaps I missed a factor of 16/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual value of k is different. Let me recompute k.

If the correct k is 0.253 /5.333 → approx 0.0475 fm^{-1}, then:

1/(2k) = 1/(2 *0.0475) → approx 10.526 fm.

Then, 16.864 *10.526 → approx 177.67 fm, which matches option C.

But why would k be different?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recompute k correctly.

The correct formula for k is k = p/ħ.

Given that p = E/(c), and ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, p = E/(c) → E=50 MeV.

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm → so, p = E/(c) = (50 MeV) / c.

Then, k = p/ħ → (50 MeV/(c)) / (197.33 MeV·fm /c) ) → the c's cancel, MeV cancels, leaving 50/(197.33) 1/fm → ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the sum should include all phase shifts up to a certain l_max, not just the given ones. But the problem states to ignore the rest beyond δ4, so l goes up to 4.

Hmm, perplexing. I've checked every step and can't find a mistake. Perhaps the correct answer is 33.3 fm, but it's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 in the calculation of units.

Wait, think again about units. If k is in 1 fm, then 1/k is in fm. So all the steps are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] * (1/k) → which would give Im(f) =16.864 * (1/0.253) ≈66.64 fm. Still not matching any options.

Wait, 66.64 is about 66.6, which is about 66.6 fm, still not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts' values. Let me recheck the phase shifts:

δ0=90° → 2δ0=180°, sin=0 → term 0.

δ1=67° → 2δ1=134° → sin=0.7193 → 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

δ2=55 →110 → sin=0.9397 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

δ3=30 →60 → sin=0.866 →7 *0.866=6.062.

δ4=13 →26 → sin=0.4384 →9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum is 16.864. Correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects the answer in meters instead of fm, but that would be 33.3e-15 m, which is way smaller than the options given.

Wait, the options are in the order of hundreds of fm, so perhaps I missed a factor of something.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should have considered the sum up to l=4, but the problem says to ignore the rest beyond δ4. So, perhaps I included all phase shifts, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. Oh no! That would change everything.

Wait, the problem says the phase shifts are given in degrees: 90°,67°, etc. But what if I treated them as radians by mistake?

Wait, for example, take δ0=90°, which is π/2 radians. If I treated it as 90 radians, which is impossible, but perhaps I thought it was in radians.

Wait, but no, the problem states the phase shifts are in degrees, so I correctly converted them to radians.

Wait, but if I forgot to convert to radians, then for each l:

Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l in degrees).

But that would give wrong values, leading to a wrong result.

But in that case, for l=1, 2δ1=134 degrees → sin(134)=0.7193.

Which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute Im(f) as (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l)) * (1/(2k)).

Which would give a different result.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l):

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1 →1.

l=1:3*sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 *sin(55)=5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.0245.

Sum=1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0245=13.382.

Then, 13.382 * (1/(2 *0.253)) )=13.382 *1.976 → approx 26.46 fm. Still not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I've done everything correctly and the result isn't matching any of the options. But perhaps I should recheck the calculation steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have taken the sum of (2l+1) * (e^{2i δ_l} -1 ), and then compute the imaginary part of that sum, multiplied by 1/(2ik).

Wait, this would mean:

sum = sum (2l+1)*(e^{2i δ_l} -1 )

= sum [ (2l+1)*(cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

So, the imaginary part of the sum is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

Then, f = (1/(2ik)) * [ sum (real parts) ) + i sum (imaginary parts) ]

So, the imaginary part of f is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

Which is what I did earlier.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 33.3 fm, which isn't among the options. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is exactly 5.333 times my result.

Wait, 33.322 *5.333 is about 177.675.

So, perhaps the correct formula includes a factor I missed, like a factor of 5.333, which is 16/3.

Wait, but why would that be the case? I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation of k was done incorrectly. Let me recompute k using E = 50 MeV in a different way.

Another approach: The relation between energy and wave number is E = ħ c k → k = E/( ħ c )

But perhaps I forgot to convert E from MeV to another unit.

Wait, ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, E=50 MeV → k=50 /197.33 → approx 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] * ( ħ c )/(2 E )

Because 1/k = ħ c / E.

So,

Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] * (ħ c )/(2 E )

= [16.864 ] * (197.33 MeV·fm) / (2 *50 MeV )

= 16.864 * (197.33 /100 ) fm → 16.864 * 1.9733 → approx 33.3 fm.

Again, same result.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is 5.333 times larger than my calculation. But I can't find where that factor would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that the formula for the imaginary part is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

But that would give:

sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) = 1*1 +3*sin67 +5*sin55 +7*sin30 +9*sin13.

Which is 1 +3*0.9205=2.7615 → sum=3.7615

Plus 5*0.8192=4.096 → sum=7.8575

Plus 7*0.5=3.5 → sum=11.3575

Plus 9*0.22495=2.0245 → sum=13.382.

Then, 13.382 * (1/(2*0.253)) )=13.382 *1.976 → approx 26.46 fm.

Still not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the real part. But the question asks for the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I have to consider that the sum is only up to l=4, but I don't see how that would change anything.

At this point, I think I've done everything correctly, but the given options don't match my result. But perhaps I should look at the options and see if any of them match any possible calculation.

Wait, option C is 177.675 fm, which is 5.333 *33.322.

5.333 is 16/3. So, perhaps I missed a factor of 16/3.

But I don't see where that would come from. Perhaps the problem intended to include higher phase shifts, but the question states to ignore them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and my calculation missed a factor due to a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum:

sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l):

l=0: 1 sin(180)=0 → 0.

l=1:3 sin(134)=3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for a mistake in the k calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use E=50 MeV as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But in that case, E_kinetic = (gamma -1) m c^2.

But for E_kinetic=50 MeV, and m c^2=0.511 MeV, gamma would be about 50 /0.511 +1 ≈98.63 +1=99.63.

So, gamma ≈99.63 → p= gamma m v, but v≈c for high gamma.

So, p=gamma m c → p=99.63 *0.511 MeV/c → approximately 50.88 MeV/c.

Then, k=p/ħ =50.88 /197.33 →≈0.257 fm^{-1}.

Which is close to my earlier calculation of 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that wouldn't change much.

At this point, I think I've done everything correctly, but the answer doesn't match any of the options. However, based on the calculations, the correct answer should be around 33.3 fm, which isn't an option. But since the closest option isn't present, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] * (1/k ) → then Im(f)=16.864 * 3.952 fm → which is about 66.6 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is multiplied by (ħ c)/(2 E ), which would be (197.33)/(2*50) → 1.9733.

So, 16.864 *1.9733 ≈33.32 fm.

Hmm.

In conclusion, based on the calculations, the correct answer should be approximately 33.3 fm, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is 5.333 times larger. But I can't see where that factor would come from.

But given the options and the calculations, perhaps I should reevaluate. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct Im(f) is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l) ] * (1/k ), leading to 16.864 /0.253 =66.64 fm. Still not matching, but option D is 251.271 fm, which is 3.78 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for ħ c, but I used 197.33 MeV·fm, which is standard.

Wait, perhaps I should use k = (E/(ħ c)) → but that would be same as before.

Hmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest possible is option C) 177.675 fm, which is 5.333 times my calculated value. But I'm not confident.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude for elastic electron scattering at an energy of 50 MeV, given phase shifts $\delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ$. The scattering amplitude $f(\theta, \phi)$ is expressed in terms of phase shifts $\delta_l$ as:

\[
f(\theta, \phi) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \left(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1\right) P_l(\cos\theta),
\]

where $P_l$ are Legendre polynomials, $k$ is the wave number, and $\theta = 0^\circ$ corresponds to the incident beam direction. At $\theta = 0$, $P_l(1) = 1$, simplifying the expression to:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \left(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1\right).
\]

The imaginary part of $f(0)$ is given by:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Step 1: Compute $k$
The wave number $k$ is related to the energy $E$ by $E = \hbar c k$, where $\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}$. For $E = 50 \, \text{MeV}$:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the sum $\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$
The phase shifts are given for $l = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. For each $l$, compute $(2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)$:

- $l = 0$: $\delta_0 = 90^\circ \implies 2\delta_0 = 180^\circ, \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \implies 1 \cdot 0 = 0$.
- $l = 1$: $\delta_1 = 67^\circ \implies 2\delta_1 = 134^\circ, \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \implies 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579$.
- $l = 2$: $\delta_2 = 55^\circ \implies 2\delta_2 = 110^\circ, \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \implies 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985$.
- $l = 3$: $\delta_3 = 30^\circ \implies 2\delta_3 = 60^\circ, \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \implies 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062$.
- $l = 4$: $\delta_4 = 13^\circ \implies 2\delta_4 = 26^\circ, \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \implies 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456$.

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) = 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\text{Im}[f(0)]$
Using the formula:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{1}{2k} \sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

substitute $k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}$ and $\sum (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 16.864$:

\[
\text{Im}[f(0)] = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.506} \approx 33.322 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated value of $\text{Im}[f(0)] \approx 33.3 \, \text{fm}$ does not match any of the provided options. However, option C ($177.675 \, \text{fm}$) is approximately $5.333$ times larger than the calculated value. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the problem setup or a missing factor in the calculation. Given the options, the closest match is:

**Answer: C**
