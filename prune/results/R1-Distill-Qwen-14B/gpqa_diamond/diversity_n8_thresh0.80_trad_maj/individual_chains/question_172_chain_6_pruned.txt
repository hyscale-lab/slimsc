Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the effective temperatures of two stars, star_1 and star_2. The key point is that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels to temperature. The formula I remember is something like the ratio of populations N_i to N_j equals exp(- (E_j - E_i)/(k T)). So if E_j is higher than E_i, the exponent is negative, meaning fewer atoms in the higher level.

In this case, the excited state must be the higher energy level. Let's say E_2 is the higher energy level, and E_1 is lower. So for star_1, the population in E_2 is twice that of star_2. So N_2(star1)/N_2(star2) = 2.

So according to Boltzmann, N_i/N_j = exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k T) ), because E_j is higher. Wait, no, let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is usually written as (N_i) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if E_i is higher than E_j, then the exponent is positive, but since it's in the denominator as (E_i - E_j), it's negative. So the ratio N_i/N_j is exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ).

Wait, in our case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote delta E as E_2 - E_1 = 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the ratio of the excited state (E_2) to the lower state (E_1) is proportional to exp( -delta E/(k T) ). Because N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) assuming same g factors, which I think we can assume for this problem.

But star_1 has N2/N1 = 2. Wait, no, wait: the problem says that the excited level
