Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 mL. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

First, I'll think about the initial step. When we dilute the acetic acid solution, the concentration will change because we're adding more volume. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. The dilution will affect its concentration, which in turn affects the pH.

Let me calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid before dilution can be found using Molarity × Volume. So, M = moles / volume (in liters). The volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So, moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 mL of water, the total volume is 40 mL (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, forming the acetate ion (CH3COO⁻), which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. The pH at equivalence depends on the hydrolysis of the acetate ion in water.

But the question isn't just about the equivalence point. It's also about the pH at 25% titration. So I need to find two pH values.

Let me think about each part separately.

First, the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, a quarter of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the amount of NaOH added is 25% of the moles of acetic acid present.

Wait, the moles of acetic acid after dilution are 0.001 moles (from earlier). So 25% of that is 0.00025 moles. So, moles of CH3COOH reacted = 0.00025 moles, and moles of CH3COO⁻ (acetate) formed = 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but the total volume at this point depends on how much NaOH solution has been added. Because each mole of NaOH is in a certain volume. Let me think. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume of NaOH needed to provide 0.00025 moles is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. So the total volume at 25% titration is the initial 40 mL plus 2.5 mL, totaling 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the solution after mixing. Alternatively, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation could be helpful here. Because at 25% titration, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1/1.85) + 5. Let me calculate that.

Wait, more accurately, pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that. The log of 1.85 is about 0.267, so pKa = 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. Approximately 4.73.

At 25% titration, the amount of HA (acetic acid) is 75% of initial, and A⁻ is 25% of initial. Wait, because when you titrate 25% of the acid, you've converted 25% of HA into A⁻. So the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] is (0.25)/(0.75) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So plugging into Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log(1/3) = 4.73 + log(0.3333)
Log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253. Which is about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 for the first value. Option D has 4.57, which is higher, so maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if I'm correctly considering the dilution when calculating the concentrations. Because the total volume increases when NaOH is added. But since the amount of HA and A⁻ are in the same ratio, the volume might not affect the ratio, so the Henderson-Hasselbalch should still apply correctly. So the pH calculation should be correct as about 4.25.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute pKa precisely.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute this:

log(1.85) = 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(1/3) → log(1/3) is -0.477. So 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So approximately 4.26. So the first part of the answer would be around 4.26.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it without using the approximation.

Another approach: in the diluted solution, the concentration is 0.025 M. When we titrate 25% of this, the moles of NaOH added is 0.00025 moles.

So the moles of CH3COOH initially are 0.001. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO⁻ (A⁻) formed = 0.00025.

Now, the volume at this point is the initial 40 mL plus the volume of NaOH added. The NaOH solution is 0.1 M, so the volume V is moles / M = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. So same as before.

So the pH would be 4.733 + log(1/3) ≈ 4.256. So about 4.26.

So the first pH is approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26, option D is 4.57, which is higher, so not matching
