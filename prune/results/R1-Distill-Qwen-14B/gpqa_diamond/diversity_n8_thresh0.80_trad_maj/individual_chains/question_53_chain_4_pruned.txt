Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. They mention the FTIR shows ester groups. Ester groups have carbonyl (C=O) stretches around 1740 cm⁻¹, I remember that from my notes. So the molecule has an ester, which is O connected to two carbonyls or something like that.

Then the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's break them down. Two aromatic-H signals. So the benzene ring has two sets of protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that cause different environments for the aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are para, there would be two sets of equivalent protons (like two doublets), but if they're ortho, maybe more splitting. Hmm, but the question says two signals, so maybe it's para substitution? Or maybe the substituents are different, leading to two different sets.

Next, two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, another a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are on a double bond. So maybe there's an ester group attached, which is O-C-O, and the other part is an alkene. Or perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl group attached? Wait, esters are usually like R-O-C-O-R', but the vinyl would be part of the substituent?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituent on the benzene is an ester group, which itself has a vinyl group. For example, perhaps the substituent is something like O-CO-O-R, but that doesn't include a vinyl. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an acyl group attached to the ring, but that might not account for the vinyl protons. Hmm, maybe the substituent is an ester and a vinyl group attached.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH, so if it's a mono-substituted double bond, maybe it's like a trans or cis configuration. The doublet could mean coupling with one adjacent proton, and the doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two different sets. Maybe it's a vinyl group attached to an oxygen, like an allyl ester or something.

Then there are two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. And no –CH2 signals. So the molecule has two methyl groups, but no methylene groups. That suggests that any CH2 groups are either not present or perhaps in a position that's not split or maybe they are part of a larger structure.

Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, right? So the substituent on the aromatic ring could be an ester, which would have an O connected to a carbonyl, and then another oxygen connected to an R group. If that R group is a vinyl group, then perhaps the structure is something like benzene with an ester substituent where the R is a vinyl CH2CH2 group? Wait, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a phenyl ester with some branching. Let me think: the compound has an ester group, so the formula must include an OCOOR group. That would come from, say, a carboxylic acid and an alcohol reacting.

The
