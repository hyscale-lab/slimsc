Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what I remember about NMR and reaction mechanisms.

The molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNp. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m -x -p)/2. So for C8H9NO:

n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), p=1 (N). So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18-11)/2=7/2=3.5. Wait, that can't be right because the degree of unsaturation has to be an integer. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, for each molecule, the general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Oh wait, X would be halogens, but here X is O and N. So maybe I should adjust for N. Wait, I might be getting confused here.

Alternatively, another way: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where X is halogens. But in this case, no X. So:

DoU = (2*8 + 2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2. Because N counts as +1. So 18-9=9, 9 +1=10. 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. So that could be, for example, one ring and four double bonds, but that's unlikely. More probably, a combination like rings and double bonds. Let's think about the NMR data.

The 1H NMR is given as:
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

So the peaks: A triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So that's likely a CHO group.

Then, there's a doublet at 6.98 ppm, integrating to 2H. That might be a pair of equivalent aromatic protons. Then another doublet at 6.51 ppm, also 2H, maybe another set of aromatic protons, perhaps meta or para to something else.

Then a broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange, like an -OH proton? Wait, no, because OH protons are usually broad, but they're usually downfield around 1-5 ppm depending on exchange. Alternatively, maybe some conjugated system. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton in a di-substituted double bond.

The 3.66 ppm d (doublet) for 2H. That's a bit upfield, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like -OCH2- or something similar. Or maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Putting this together. Let's think about the structure. If there's an aldehyde (CHO), then an aromatic ring, maybe with substituents. The aldehyde is at one end, and a benzene ring attached somewhere.

Looking at the NMR, the two aromatic doublets could suggest a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the two protons would be equivalent and split into a doublet. So, maybe the aromatic ring is attached to something else.

Wait
