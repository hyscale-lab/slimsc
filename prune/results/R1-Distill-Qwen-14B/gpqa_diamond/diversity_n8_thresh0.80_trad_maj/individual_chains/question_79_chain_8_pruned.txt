Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step.

The question involves identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. The starting material is Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Oh wait, no, Sharpless uses a different reagent, maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in epoxide opening or another type of reaction. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reagent is used for epoxidation. Oh right, I think that 1,4-diazabicyclooctane derivatives are sometimes used as bases in some reactions, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, could it be a ring-opening of an epoxide? Or perhaps it's a catalyst for some kind of cyclization.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So maybe the reaction is an epoxidation? Because Compound X has an oxygen, so perhaps it's an alkene that's being epoxidized. Or maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide. Wait, no, the product's formula isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O. Let's think about the possible structure.

Looking at the options, all the options are oxiranes, which are epoxides. So perhaps the starting material is a diene or something that can form an epoxide upon reaction. Wait, no, if all the options are epoxides, that suggests that the product is the epoxide. So perhaps the starting material, Compound X, is an alkene that reacts with the reagent to form an epoxide. Or maybe it's an epoxide that undergoes some reaction, but I'm not sure. Wait, the options are A to D, each an epoxide, so the product must be an epoxide. So the reaction must have converted Compound X into an epoxide. But wait, the initial formula is C11H12O. Let me check what the options would look like.

Wait, the product's NMR is given, so the structure of the product is an epoxide. So, the starting material, Compound X, perhaps is an alkene that was epoxidized, so the product is an epoxide. So the reagent must be for epoxidation, but which reagent does that? Oh, I think mCPBA (meta-chloroperbenzoic acid) is a common epoxidizing agent. But the problem says the reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Wait, that's a base, like a crown ether. Oh, wait, maybe it's part of a specific epoxidation method. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in a different kind of reaction, like a peroxide formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxide ring-opening. But in that case, the product would have a different structure. Hmm. Maybe I should focus on the NMR data of the product and see what the structure is, then figure out what the starting material was.

So the product's NMR is given. Let's look at the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So the peaks at 2.28 and 2.31 are two singlets, each integrating to 3H. So that's two methyl groups attached to something that's deshielded but not near any other protons. Perhaps attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or in a conjugated system.

The aromatic region has several peaks. 6.75 (1H, d), then 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down. Let's say we have two doublets of 2H each and two doublets of 1H each. Wait, no: for the 1H NMR, the peaks are:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, that's a total of 1+2+1+2=6H, but the starting formula is C11H12O, which is 12 H, so the product has 12 H? Wait, the product is the result of a reaction, but I don't know its formula. Hmm, maybe the product is the epoxide, which would have two more oxygen atoms? Or maybe it's another structure. Maybe I should look for substituents on the aromatic ring.

In the 13C NMR, the data is:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Hmm. Let's see. The 21.3 and 28.4 are quaternary carbons, likely from methyl groups attached
