Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations yet. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we add water, it'll dilute, so the concentration will decrease. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. 

So the initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) with 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So M2 is (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me calculate that: 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001, divided by 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (which provides OH-) will be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. 

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So I need to find out how much moles of acetic acid are present initially, then find out how much has been neutralized, and then calculate the pH based on the remaining acid and the conjugate base formed.

Wait, let's compute the moles. The diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 × 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the NaOH adds OH- which deprotonates the acetic acid. So the solution at 25%
