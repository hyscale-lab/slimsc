Okay, I need to figure out the structure of Compound X based on the given IR and NMR data, and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's start by analyzing the spectral data.

First, the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But more specifically, the broadness might suggest an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, maybe the compound has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and an O-H group, possibly a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for a carboxylic acid proton. So, that makes sense if there's a COOH group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two protons on one position and another two on the opposite.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, same integration as the previous. So, perhaps it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents each in positions 4 and 1, for example. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, each proton would be a singlet if there's only one substituent. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted ring where each substituent is in the para position relative to each other. Or perhaps each substituent is para to another substituent.

Wait, maybe it's a substituted benzene with two groups. For example, a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1. So like, a benzene ring with two groups opposite each other. So each proton on the ring would be a doublet, as they are adjacent to one substituent. Like in para-xylene, but that's all CH3 groups. Or maybe a substituent with an OCH3 group or something else.

Wait, but looking at the substituents, the ring has two groups attached. Maybe it's a 4-ethylphenyl group, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a COOH group and another substituent. Let's think.

The other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break this down.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, like in an isopropyl group or a butyl chain. Wait, 1.4 ppm is a typical CH(CH3) something. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) might be a CH2 group adjacent to the branching. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH group attached to something else, perhaps an oxygen or another chain.

Putting this together, perhaps there's a substituent on the benzene ring which is a sec-butyl group or something similar. Let's see.

Wait, the substituent chain: the 0.9 triplet is likely a CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but the triplet at 0.9 would correspond to the CH2 at the end of a chain, so perhaps it's -CH2CH2CH2CH3. But then the 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 next to a branching point. The 1.4 ppm (3H) as a doublet suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which would be the case in a isopropyl group or a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent could be a pentyl group? No, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, if it's a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the protons on the CH would be the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), the CH2 next to it would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), and the CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). But wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe it's a (CH2)2CH group?

Alternatively, maybe there's a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me draw this out.

If the substituent is a propyl chain with a methyl branch, like isobutyl. Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No,
