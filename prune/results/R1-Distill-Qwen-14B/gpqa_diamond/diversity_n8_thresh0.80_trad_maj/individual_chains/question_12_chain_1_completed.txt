Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, I think. So it's a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. And the pion is stationary, which probably means it's at rest when it decays. 

The rest masses are given: the pion has 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Wait, but what about the neutrino? Hmm, I remember that neutrinos are very light. In some cases, they're considered massless. So maybe I can treat the neutrino's rest mass as zero for this problem.

So the problem is to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The options are given, each with two values. I guess each option lists the KE of the muon and the neutrino. 

Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

Let me think about energy and momentum conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. 

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass, so its energy is E_mu = gamma * m_mu c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since it's massless) plus its rest energy, which is zero, so E_nu = K_nu.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the neutrino's energy is its kinetic energy because its rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu.

But wait, wait. The total energy after decay is E_pi_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

So, 139.6 MeV = E_mu + E_nu.

But E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma * m_mu c². And m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV. So E_mu = gamma * 105.7 MeV.

E_nu is the kinetic energy of the neutrino, since the rest mass is zero. So E_nu = K_nu.

Also, the momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay is zero. So the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal. 

Momentum of muon p_mu = gamma * m_mu * v. And for the neutrino, p_nu = E_nu / c (since for massless particles, E = pc). Wait, but units here—since we're working in MeV and masses in MeV/c², probably, let me not get confused. Let me think in terms of units.

In natural units where c=1, E² = p² + m². So for the muon, E_mu² = p_mu² + (105.7)^2. For the neutrino, E_nu² = p_nu² (since m=0). 

And from momentum conservation, p_mu = p_nu. Let's call this common momentum p. So, p_mu = p_nu = p.

So, for the muon: E_mu² = p² + (105.7)^2.
For the neutrino: E_nu² = p².

So, E_mu² = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

And from the energy conservation equation: E_mu + E_nu = 139.6.

Hmm, so I have two equations:

1) E_mu + E_nu = 139.6

2) E_mu² = E_nu² + (105.7)^2

I can substitute E_mu from equation 1 into equation 2.

Wait, let me denote E_mu as E_m and E_nu as E_n for simplicity.

Equation 1: E_m + E_n = 139.6

Equation 2: E_m² = E_n² + (105.7)^2.

Express E_m from equation 1: E_m = 139.6 - E_n.

Substitute into equation 2:

(139.6 - E_n)^2 = E_n² + (105.7)^2.

Let me expand the left side:

139.6² - 2 * 139.6 * E_n + E_n² = E_n² + (105.7)^2.

Subtract E_n² from both sides:

139.6² - 2*139.6*E_n = (105.7)^2.

Compute 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6 squared: let's compute 140^2 = 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. (139.6)^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

105.7 squared: (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So the equation becomes:

19488.16 - 279.2 * E_n = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2 * E_n.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 * E_n.

E_n = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's calculate that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, approximate:

279.2 * 30 = 8376. That's a bit higher than 8315.67.

Wait, wait, maybe 29.8? Let me compute 279.2 * 29.8.

Wait, wait, perhaps I can compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is larger than 8315.67. So 29.8 is perhaps a better number.

Wait, 279.2 * 29 = let's compute: 279.2 *20 = 5584, 279.2*9=2512.8 → total 5584 +2512.8=8096.8. Now 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

218.87 divided by 279.2 is about 0.783.

So E_n is approximately 29 + 0.783 ≈ 29.783 MeV. So approximately 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 279.2 * x = 8315.67.

x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, alternatively, using a calculator approach: 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

279.2 *29 = 279.2 *30 = 8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

279.2 *0.8 = 223.36. So 29.8 gives 8096.8 +223.36=8320.16. Oh, that's close to 8315.67.

So 29.8 would give 8320.16, which is a bit higher than 8315.67.

The difference is 8320.16 -8315.67=4.49.

So, to find how much less than 29.8, let's compute 4.49 / 279.2 ≈ 0.016.

So the actual x is approx 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

So E_n ≈ 29.784 MeV ≈ 29.8 MeV.

So the neutrino's energy is about 29.8 MeV, which is its kinetic energy because it's massless.

Wait, but the problem is to find the KE of the product particles. So the muon's KE would be E_mu - m_mu c², since E_mu is total energy, which includes rest mass energy.

E_mu = (139.6 - E_n) MeV.

E_n is approximately 29.8, so E_mu ≈ 139.6 -29.8 = 109.8 MeV.

Wait, but the muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So its kinetic energy would be E_mu - 105.7.

So K_mu = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

So the KEs would be 4.1 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Hmm, that's very close. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the neutrino's energy is E_n = 29.8 MeV. So the muon's energy is E_mu = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 MeV.

So the kinetic energy of the muon is 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV. So approximately 4.1 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8. So that's a match.

But wait, perhaps the calculation was a bit more precise, leading to 4.12. Let me recompute E_n more accurately.

E_n = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 × 29.8.

Wait, 279.2 × 29 = 8096.8.

279.2 × 0.8 = 223.36.

Total is 8096.8 + 223.36 = 8320.16.

But our numerator is 8315.67, which is 8320.16 -4.49.

So 4.49 less than 29.8 *279.2.

So the value is 29.8 minus (4.49 / 279.2).

4.49 ÷ 279.2 ≈ 0.01606.

So E_n ≈ 29.8 -0.01606 ≈ 29.7839 MeV.

So E_n ≈29.784 MeV.

So E_mu = 139.6 -29.784 = 109.816 MeV.

So K_mu = 109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV, which is about 4.12 MeV.

Ah, so that's why option D is 4.12 and 29.8.

So the answer should be D.


The problem involves finding the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino in the decay of a stationary positively charged pion, given by the reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

### Key Information:
- Rest mass of the pion: \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of the muon: \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Neutrino is massless (\( m_\nu = 0 \)).

### Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the total energy of the muon (\( E_\mu \)) and the energy of the neutrino (\( E_\nu \)):  
   \[
   E_\mu + E_\nu = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum after decay must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:  
   \[
   p_\mu = p_\nu = p.
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation:
For the muon (with rest mass):  
\[
E_\mu^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]  
For the neutrino (massless):  
\[
E_\nu^2 = p^2.
\]  
Equating the two:  
\[
E_\mu^2 = E_\nu^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

### Solving the Equations:
From energy conservation:  
\[
E_\mu = 139.6 - E_\nu.
\]  
Substitute \( E_\mu \) into the energy-momentum relation:  
\[
(139.6 - E_\nu)^2 = E_\nu^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot E_\nu = (105.7)^2.
\]  
Compute the squares:  
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49.
\]  
Substitute these values:  
\[
19488.16 - 279.2 \cdot E_\nu = 11172.49.
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
279.2 \cdot E_\nu = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]  
Solve for \( E_\nu \):  
\[
E_\nu = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Thus, the neutrino's energy is approximately \( E_\nu \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), which is its kinetic energy since it is massless.

From energy conservation:  
\[
E_\mu = 139.6 - E_\nu = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The total energy of the muon includes its rest energy (\( 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)), so its kinetic energy is:  
\[
K_\mu = E_\mu - m_{\mu^+} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Refining the calculation, \( K_\mu \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. This matches **Option D**.
