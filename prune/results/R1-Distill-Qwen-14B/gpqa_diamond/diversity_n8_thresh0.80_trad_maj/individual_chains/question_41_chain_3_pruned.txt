Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? And we're told to take the speed of light in a vacuum as c=1.

Hmm, okay. So the glass is moving, and light is moving through it. I remember that when a medium is moving relative to an observer, there's some effect on the observed speed of light, right? Or maybe it's about how the medium's motion affects the light's velocity.

Wait, but wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. So in the glass, the speed of light is v_light = 1/n, since c=1 here.

But then, the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about frames of reference. The glass is moving, so maybe I should consider the velocity addition formula from relativity? But wait, the velocities here are probably non-relativistic since the problem doesn't mention anything about speeds approaching c. Oh, but wait, the glass's velocity is v, and the light's speed in the medium is 1/n. So
