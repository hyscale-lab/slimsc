Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because phosphate buffer solutions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) that contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Hmm, wait. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, right? So H3PO4 can lose three protons, becoming H2PO4^- (after first dissociation), then HPO4^2- (second), and finally PO4^3- (third). But I remember that phosphoric acid is a triprotic acid, and each dissociation has its own Ka value.

The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So all are pretty small, but especially the third one is really tiny. That probably means that the concentration of PO4^3- is quite low because it's the third dissociation step, which doesn't happen much.

The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, let me think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When dissolved in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So that's H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So that gives us HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Oh wait, so this is a buffer solution because it's a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So the buffer is between the second and third dissociation steps.

Hold on, the problem is about finding the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the third ionization. But wait, in this buffer solution, we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the buffer equation would be H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+.

But wait, the H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, using Ka2.

But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is a further step. So the HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+ again, with Ka3. So that's the third dissociation.

So, perhaps the concentration of PO4^3- comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But wait, the buffer solution is made from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in higher concentrations. The PO4^3- is much less because Ka3 is so small.

So, to find [PO4^3-], I might need to consider the dissociation of HPO4^2-.

But first, perhaps I should calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- to find
