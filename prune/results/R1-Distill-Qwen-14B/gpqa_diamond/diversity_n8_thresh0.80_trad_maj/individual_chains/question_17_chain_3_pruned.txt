Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. And we're given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so the metal ion is more tightly bound.

But how does this relate to the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution? Oh right, when EDTA complexes with Ca²+, the free Ca²+ ions in the solution should be low because most of them are tied up in the complex.

So the formula for the formation constant is probably key here. The general equation for the complex formation is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this problem, the EDTA is in excess, I think. Because when you have a 1:1 complex like this, the concentration of the complex is the sum of the free Ca²+ and the free EDTA. But wait, the problem states that the solution is "stoichiometric" Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, stoichiometric usually means the molar ratio is exactly 1:1. So if the concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, that implies that all the Ca²+ and EDTA are used up in forming the complex. But wait, that can't be right because some dissociation must occur. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because even when the solution is considered stoichiometric, there's some dissociation. So the EDTA and Ca²+ concentrations aren't zero, but they are just in a complex form.

So let's model this. Let me define the variables.

Let the concentration of the complex be [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M. Let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x
