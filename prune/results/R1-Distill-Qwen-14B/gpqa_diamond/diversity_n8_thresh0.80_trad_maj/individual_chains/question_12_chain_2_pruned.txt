Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles and their kinetic energy after a decay. Let me try to wrap my head around it. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) meson decays into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The Pi is at rest, which probably simplifies things a bit.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, the conservation laws apply. So, I should think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the Pi is stationary, its initial momentum is zero. But wait, the neutrino is massless or has negligible mass, right? So the muon and neutrino have to move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But wait, the muon has rest mass, so maybe that's the way to approach it.

The rest masses given are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. So the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so I can treat it as zero.

Hmm, so the total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, each product will have their rest masses plus kinetic energy. So the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is effectively zero. So the total energy after decay should be the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy.

But wait, energy and momentum must both be conserved. The Pi is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But the neutrino's momentum is p_nu = E_nu / c^2, since for massless particles, E = pc. The muon's momentum is sqrt( (E_mu^2) - (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, maybe I should approach this using energy and momentum conservation equations.

Let me denote:

E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: since Pi is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the muon's momentum p_mu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum p_nu. So p
