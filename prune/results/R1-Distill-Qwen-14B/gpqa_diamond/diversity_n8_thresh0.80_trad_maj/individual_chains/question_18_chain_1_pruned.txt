Okay, so I have this question about stellar abundances and ratios. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But maybe the masses aren't directly relevant because the question is about elemental abundances, right?

The given abundances are in terms of dex, which I remember stands for decimal exponent. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) where n_X is the number density of element X relative to Y. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the notation [X/Y]_star is the logarithm of the ratio of their abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y in star) - log10(n_X/n_Y in Sun) = log10( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

The given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than the Sun by a factor of 10^0.3.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg/Si is higher in Star_2 than the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Mg abundance relative to H is same as Sun.

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.
Wait, wait, no. Wait the formula is 12 + log10(...) = value. So for Fe, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^-4.5. Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, let me double-check. The standard notation is that for the Sun, the abundance of an element X is given by 12 + log10(n_X / n_H) = something. So for example, for Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5.

Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Now, the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in
