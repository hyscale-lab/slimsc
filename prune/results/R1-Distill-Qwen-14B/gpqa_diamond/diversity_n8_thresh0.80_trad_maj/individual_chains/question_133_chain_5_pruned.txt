Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The solution has 200.00 cm³, so that's 0.2 liters. The compounds involved are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, each at 1.00 grams. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates into H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, or PO4^3- depending on the pH.

Wait, but the problem says orthophosphate ions. Oh, right, orthophosphate can refer to HPO4^2- and PO4^3- maybe. Or perhaps it's all the species, but I'm not sure. Let's check the K values.

The given K values are Ka1, Ka2, Ka3 for H3PO4. Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. Third is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

So, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are buffer solutions. KH2PO4 is a weak acid (since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid), and Na2HPO4 is
