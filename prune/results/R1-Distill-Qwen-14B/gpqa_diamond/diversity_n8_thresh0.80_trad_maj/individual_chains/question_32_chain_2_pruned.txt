Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Wait, the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So, Li normally has 3 protons, right? Oh, and 3 neutrons make it Li-6, I think. So the mass number A is 6 (3 protons + 3 neutrons). So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, I need to find the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. So we're dealing with relativistic speeds here. I remember that when velocities are a significant fraction of c, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity.

The energy in question is probably the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v²/c²). So I'll need to compute gamma first.

Let me jot down the formula. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Here, v is 0.96c. So substituting, v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28. Hmm, 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/(7/25) is 25/7 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, 25 ÷7 is about 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the rest mass energy (m0 c²) for the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is the atomic mass. Oh wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Because each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 1 u, so 6 of them would be roughly 6 u.

But wait, the exact mass might be a bit different because of binding energy, but for this problem, I think we can take it as 6 u. Because when dealing with heavy ions, the rest mass is approximated as A u, where A is the mass number.

So m0 c² is 6 u multiplied by c². But wait, we need E in GeV. I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, converting that: 6 u * 931.5 MeV/c² = 6 * 9
