Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

Wait, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene bonds. Oh right, it can cause ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis depending on the structure.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, since it's an alkene, maybe the configuration comes into play. Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2. The structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, no, wait, pent has five carbons. So 1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, let me number the carbons. 1 2 3 4 5. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the parent chain is five carbons with a double bond starting at 1. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. But 3-methyl would be a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Pent-1-ene has five carbons. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Or perhaps CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, wait. Let me structure it correctly.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. If it's 3-methyl, then a methyl group is attached to the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The molecule is symmetric? Hmm, not sure. Wait, is it symmetric? Let's see.

Wait, the molecule would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So the structure is CH2-CH2 is not possible, wait. Wait, CH2 is the first carbon, double bond to CH, which is C2. Then C3 is CH(CH3), then C4 is CH2, and C5 is CH3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Wait, does that make it a symmetric molecule? Let me see. If I look at the molecule, the groups on either side of the double bond are CH2CH2CH3 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. No, that's not symmetric. So it's a chiral molecule? Because the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 has a methyl group. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So the molecule is not symmetric because the substituents on either end of the double bond are different. So the molecule is chiral, hence why it's racemic.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think. For a molecule to be chiral, it must have a central carbon with four different groups. Wait, but this is about the double bond. Oh, wait, no. The molecule itself isn't chiral because the double bond doesn't have a central carbon with four different groups. Wait, maybe I'm confused. So wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is not a chiral molecule because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, the substituents on the double bond are CH2CH2CH3 on one side and CH(CH3)CH2CH3 on the other. So the molecule is symmetric? Wait, no. Because the left side is (CH₂)₂CH3 and the right is CH(CH3)CH₂₂CH3? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that it's actually a meso compound or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is symmetric. Let me see: if I have CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, then the groups on either end of the double bond are CH₂CH₂CH3 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Are these groups the same? No. So the molecule is not symmetric. So it's a chiral molecule because the double bond leads to a configuration that can have enantiomers. Wait, but double bonds with different substituents on each side can lead to E and Z isomers. Or wait, no, because it's about the substituents around the double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. So it's a mixture of E and Z isomers? Or perhaps it's a single isomer but in enantiomeric forms. Wait, no, wait. For a molecule to be racemic, it must have a chiral center or a plane of symmetry. Wait, maybe 3-methylpent-1-ene is a non-polar molecule with a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. So the reaction would break and reform the double bonds. Metathesis can lead to different products based on where the catalyst breaks the bonds.

In this case, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So when treated with Grubbs, which is a transition metal catalyst, it will facilitate the metathesis.

So the possible sites for metathesis would be the breaking of the C1-C2 double bond, and then the catalyst would rearrange the fragments.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo ring-closing metathesis if possible, but with such a structure, I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might undergo cross metathesis if another alkene is present, but since the problem says racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene, perhaps it's a self-metathesis.

Wait, but without another alkene, the main reaction would be the breaking and reforming of the same double bond, which would lead to possible rearrangements.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a ring. Let me think: from 3-methylpent-1-ene, can it form a ring? The chain is five carbons, but with a double bond at the first position. If it undergoes ring-closing, perhaps a five-membered ring would form.

Wait, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. If the Grubbs catalyst causes the double bond to break and reform, perhaps the ends could connect to form a ring. Let me see. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So during metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond and exchange substituents.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs is used on a simple alkene, it can cause the molecule to undergo ring-closing, but for that, the structure needs to have two ends that can connect. For example, in a diene, the catalyst can bring the two ends together to form a ring.

Wait, but 3-methylpent-1-ene has only one double bond. So perhaps the metathesis would involve breaking that double bond and then recombining the fragments. So the molecule could break into two parts, but since it's a five-carbon molecule, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis could lead to different products based on where the bonds break and re-form. Let me think. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the catalyst could perform a ring-closing by connecting the end of the chain to another part.

Wait, in the molecule CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, the CH₂=CH- is one end, and the -CH₂-CH3 is the other. To form a ring, the end CH₂-CH3 would need to connect back to the beginning. But that would require a very long chain, which I don't think is possible here. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis could form a smaller ring, like a four-membered ring.

Wait, maybe the molecule can form a four-membered ring via ring-closing metathesis, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a metathesis that results in a different alkene structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst would cause the double bond to shift. For example, the initial double bond is between C1 and C2. Metathesis could lead to a shift in the position of the double bond.

Wait, but metathesis can lead to the formation of different alkenes based on the positions where the catalyst facilitates the exchange. So in this case, the possible products would be the result of different rearrangements.

Another possibility is that the catalyst could cause an isomerization of the starting alkene, but I think Grubbs is more about breaking and reforming double bonds rather than isomerizing.

So, considering all this, how many different products would form when the racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs?

Wait, another thought: the molecule could undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic product. Let me consider that.

If the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, the Grubbs catalyst could cause the double bond to break and then the ends (CH₂ and CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3) could recombine to form a ring. Wait, but how many carbons would that involve?

If the double bond breaks, the two ends would be CH₂ and CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, perhaps the CH₂ from one end and the CH(CH3) from the other end could form a new double bond, creating a smaller ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism here. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis would produce a smaller alkene and ethene as a byproduct. Because Grubbs can lead to the release of ethene when a ring closes.

Wait, the question specifies to exclude ethene. So, the number of possible products (excluding ethene) would depend on how many different alkenes can form.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting molecule can undergo more than one type of metathesis, leading to different products.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible alkenes that can form from 3-methylpent-1-ene via metathesis.

The starting molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

When Grubbs catalyst is used, the double bond can break and recombine in different ways.

Option 1: The same double bond reforms, but that wouldn't produce a new product, so perhaps that's not a product.

Option 2: The double bond shifts position. So what positions could the double bond shift to?

If the double bond shifts from C1-C2 to, say, C2-C3, or C3-C4.

Wait, but in metathesis, the catalyst facilitates the breaking of the double bond and the exchange of substituents. So perhaps the product could have the double bond in a different position.

So, let's consider possible positions where the double bond could move.

Original structure: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Possible shifts:

1. Shift to between C2 and C3: CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, but that would require a single bond, so maybe the double bond moves to C2-C3, making CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, during metathesis, the double bond can break, and the ends can rearrange. So for the initial structure, breaking the C1-C2 double bond gives two fragments: CH₂ (from C1) and CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3 (from C2 to C5).

Wait, but how would that recombine? The Grubbs catalyst can bring together different ends to form new double bonds. So, perhaps the CH₂ fragment could connect to a different part of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could undergo a ring-closing metathesis, forming a cyclic product and releasing ethene.

So, let's consider that. For ring-closing, the molecule would form a cycle, and ethene would be released as a byproduct. So the product would be a cyclic alkene, and ethene is excluded, so that counts as a product.

Alternatively, perhaps multiple rings can form, leading to different products.

Wait, but let's think about the starting molecule: it's five carbons long. So ring-closing could form a 4-membered ring (if the ends connect at two carbons apart) or a 5-membered ring (connecting the first and last carbons).

Wait, maybe the 5-membered ring would be more favorable, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. So the chain is: C1 (CH2), C2 (CH), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH2), C5 (CH3). To form a 5-membered ring, the double bond would need to connect C1 and C5, but I don't think that's possible here.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a four-membered ring by connecting C1 and C3 or something like that. But I'm not exactly sure how.

Alternatively, maybe the metathesis doesn't form a ring but instead rearranges the double bond to a different position.

Another possibility is that the molecule could break and form two smaller alkenes. But since the starting material is a monoene, perhaps it would produce a smaller alkene and ethene. But ethene is excluded, so we'd count the smaller alkene.

Wait, let's think about possible alkenes that could result.

If the double bond shifts from C1-C2 to C3-C4, would that be possible? Let me see.

Original structure: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

After metathesis, maybe it becomes CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, but that would just be a single bond. So that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond shifts to C2-C3.

So, the structure would be CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right because the positions don't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks and reconnects in a way that a new double bond forms elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst causes the double bond to shift to a more substituted position, leading to more stable alkenes.

Wait, another thought: the metathesis could lead to the formation of different stereoisomers, but since the starting material is racemic, perhaps the products would also be a mix of stereoisomers, but the question asks for the number of possible products, not considering stereochemistry.

Alternatively, maybe the number of possible products is determined by the possible structures that can form.

Wait, let me think about the possible products. Each product would be an alkene with a different structure, excluding ethene.

Option 1: The starting material remains as is. But I think this is not a product since the question is about products formed.

Option 2: The molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclic alkene, along with ethene. But ethene is excluded, so the ring product counts.

Option 3: The molecule undergoes a shift in the double bond position, forming a different mono-alkene.

So, how many different alkenes can form?

If the starting molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, after metathesis, possible products could be:

1. The same molecule (but not a product, as it's the starting material).

2. A ring-closed product, such as cyclopentene (but substituted) or another cyclic structure.

3. A different open-chain alkene.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact structures. Let me try to think of how the metathesis could proceed.

In olefin metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond and recombines the ends in different ways. So, for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond could break, and the two ends could exchange partners, leading to different products.

Let me imagine the starting molecule as:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

When the double bond breaks, the Grubbs catalyst would have two ends: one is CH₂- and the other is CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Wait, but I'm not entirely clear on how the catalyst works. Alternatively, perhaps the two ends could exchange, leading to different combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can undergo a cross metathesis, but without another alkene, it's more likely to undergo ring-closing or a shift in the double bond.

Another possibility is that the starting molecule can undergo a ring-closing metathesis to form a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should count the possible products systematically.

Possible mechanisms:

1. Ring-closing metathesis leading to a cyclic product. How many such products are possible?

2. Open-chain metathesis leading to a different position of the double bond.

So, for ring-closing, how many different rings can form?

If the molecule forms a five-membered ring, that would require the ends to connect in a way that forms a ring. Let me see: the chain is five carbons, so connecting C1 and C4 would form a four-membered ring, perhaps, or C1 and C5 would form a five-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

Structure: C1 (CH2), C2 (CH), C3 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH2), C5 (CH3).

For a ring-closing metathesis, the double bond would need to form between two carbons that are not adjacent. For example, between C1 and C3, or C2 and C4, etc.

Wait, but during metathesis, the double bond breaks, and the ends are reconnected. So perhaps the catalyst would cause the original double bond (C1-C2) to break, and then the ends (CH2 and CH(CH3)CH2CH3) would recombine in different ways.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the possible products are determined by the different possible alkenes that can form from the metathesis.

So, the starting molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3.

Possible products after metathesis could include:

1. 1,3-diene: but I don't think metathesis would produce that from a single alkene.

2. The same structure (but not a product, so not counted).

3. A different mono-alkene.

4. A cyclic diene (if ring-closing happens).

Wait, perhaps the possible products are the result of shifting the double bond to different positions.

In the starting material, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Possible shifts could be to between C2 and C3, or C3 and C4, but I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Wait, let's think about the possible alkenes that can form:

- 3-methylpent-1-ene (the starting material).

- 3-methylpent-2-ene.

- 3-methylpent-3-ene.

Wait, but wait, are these possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond can shift to form 3-methylpent-2-ene or 3-methylpent-3-ene.

Wait, but shifting the double bond from 1-ene to 2-ene or 3-ene would require the catalyst to enable that.

Alternatively, the metathesis could produce 3-methylpent-1-ene and ethylene, but ethylene is excluded.

But perhaps another product is possible when the double bond shifts.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule can form a more substituted alkene, which is more stable, so the double bond could shift to a more substituted position, like between C3 and C4.

Wait, but let me think about the possible alkenes.

1. 3-methylpent-1-ene (same as starting material, so not a new product).

2. 3-methylpent-2-ene: structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not possible because the double bond can't be in the middle without substituents.

Wait, no, 3-methylpent-2-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's actually the same as the starting material. Because the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, which is 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me think again.

Wait, if the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene, which is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, then the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

If the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, that would be 2-pentene, but with a methyl group on C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't make sense because the double bond would be between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not possible because the double bond would have to be between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure would be CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, but that's a single bond. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis could produce a more substituted alkene. Let's think about the possible alkenes that are more substituted.

In the starting material, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents are CH3 on C3 and two methyl groups on C4 and C5.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Let me think about the number of possible products. The options are 2,4,6,8.

Wait, another possibility: since the starting material is racemic, each enantiomer might produce the same product upon metathesis, so the number of products depends on how many different structures can form, regardless of stereochemistry.

So, perhaps the metathesis leads to multiple products based on the way the catalyst recombines the fragments.

Wait, another approach: Grubbs can cause the molecule to undergo ring-closing metathesis, forming a cyclic product. Let's say a four-membered ring or a five-membered ring.

A four-membered ring would have a double bond between two adjacent carbons, perhaps leading to a substituted cyclobutene.

A five-membered ring would form a cyclopentene derivative.

So, each ring size would be a different product.

Additionally, perhaps the molecule can also undergo a shift in the position of the double bond in the open-chain structure, leading to different alkenes.

So, counting:

1. 4-membered ring product.

2. 5-membered ring product.

3. Open-chain product with double bond at position 2.

4. Open-chain product with double bond at position 3.

Wait, but how many are possible?

Alternatively, perhaps the open-chain product can have different positions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of each possible product.

Option 1: The molecule undergoes ring-closing metathesis to form a cyclobutene derivative.

Structure would be something like CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it forms a five-membered ring, which would be more likely.

So, cyclopentene derivative, which would be a new product.

Option 2: The molecule undergoes a shift in the double bond to form a more substituted alkene.

So, for example, moving the double bond from C1-C2 to C2-C3 or C3-C4.

If the double bond moves to C2-C3, the structure would be CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3: CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, but that's impossible because you can't have two single bonds in a row. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure becomes CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, but with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, that's the same as the starting material. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the double bond shifts to between C3 and C4, making it CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, structure would be CH₂-CH₂-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3, but with a double bond between C3 and C4: CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH3, but that's not possible.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I think the key is that Grubbs can cause the molecule to undergo ring-closing metathesis, which would form a cyclic product, and then another product where the double bond shifts elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form two different cyclic products.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis can form two different four-membered rings or a four-membered and a five-membered ring.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can form a single cyclic product and a few open-chain products.

But considering the possible structures, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible products again.

Another angle: Grubbs catalyst can lead to the formation of different alkenes based on the possible ways the ends can recombine.

In the starting molecule, after breaking the double bond, the two ends are CH₂ and CH(CH3)CH₂CH3.

These two ends can recombine in different ways:

1. CH₂ and CH(CH3)CH₂CH3 can form a new double bond, leading to a four-membered ring or a different open-chain product.

Wait, perhaps the recombination could form a new double bond between what were the CH₂ end and a different position in the chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH₂ can connect to the third carbon, making a new double bond.

So, the new product would have a double bond between C1 and C3, but that's not possible because that would require a three-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps I'm not thinking correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of 3-methyl-1-pentene and ethylene. But ethylene is excluded, so 3-methyl-1-pentene is the product, but that's the same as the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different product.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-methylcyclopentene, a five-membered ring with the double bond.

So, the product would be cyclopentene with a methyl group on one of the carbons.

How many such structures are possible? Well, in a five-membered ring, the methyl group could be on C1 or C2, etc., but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing metathesis leads to a single product.

So, if I have one ring product and perhaps another open-chain product, that would be two products.

But the options don't have 2 as the correct answer.

Wait, the options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is racemic, so it's a mixture of two enantiomers. But since Grubbs doesn't change the configuration, the products would also be racemic, but the question is about the number of possible products, not regarding their stereochemistry.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecule can form different products based on the possible sites of ring closure or double bond shifts.

If the molecule can undergo ring-closing at two different positions, leading to two different ring products, and also form two different open-chain products via double bond shifts, that would give a total of four products.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible products is 2: one cyclic and one open-chain.

But then the options have D as 2, but I think I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: since the starting molecule is racemic, each enantiomer would produce the same product. So any products would be the same regardless of the starting enantiomer.

So, if there are two different products (cyclic and open-chain), that would be two products.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of products is four. Let me think: perhaps the molecule can form two different cyclic products and two different open-chain products, leading to four products.

But I'm really not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 2. Because the metathesis could either form a ring (like cyclopentene derivative) or a different open-chain alkene, leading to two products.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the number is 4, considering different possibilities.

Wait, thinking again, Grubbs can cause the molecule to undergo metathesis in two different ways:

1. Ring-closing to form a four-membered ring.

2. Ring-closing to form a five-membered ring.

3. Breaking and forming a new double bond in the open-chain structure.

Wait, but how many different open-chain products can form?

If the double bond shifts to between C2 and C3, and between C3 and C4, that would be two different alkenes.

Plus, the two ring products, that's four products.

So, that would make four possible products, excluding ethene.

But I'm not sure if all of these are possible.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two possible open-chain products and two possible ring products, leading to four products.

So, the answer would be option A)4.

But I'm not entirely confident.


The problem involves treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst can break and reform double bonds, leading to the formation of new products. The starting material, 3-methylpent-1-ene, has a double bond between C1 and C2, and the molecule is chiral due to the presence of a methyl group on C3. The racemic nature of the starting material means it is a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers, but stereochemistry does not affect the number of possible products.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM):**
   - Grubbs catalyst can promote ring-closing metathesis, where the double bond breaks, and the ends of the molecule recombine to form a cyclic product. 
   - Two possible cyclic products can form:
     - A **four-membered ring** (cyclobutene derivative).
     - A **five-membered ring** (cyclopentene derivative).

2. **Open-Chain Metathesis:**
   - The double bond can shift to different positions in the open-chain structure, leading to new alkenes.
   - Two possible open-chain products can form:
     - A double bond between C2 and C3, forming **3-methylpent-2-ene**.
     - A double bond between C3 and C4, forming **3-methylpent-3-ene**.

3. **Exclusion of Ethene:**
   - Ethene, which can be released as a byproduct during metathesis, is explicitly excluded from the count of products.

### Conclusion:
The total number of possible products, excluding ethene, is **four**:
- Two cyclic products (four-membered and five-membered rings).
- Two open-chain products (3-methylpent-2-ene and 3-methylpent-3-ene).

Thus, the correct answer is **4**.

Answer: A
