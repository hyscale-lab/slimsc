Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about the distribution of stars with parallax. Hmm, let's see. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are a bunch of inverse powers of plx.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance, which means distance d = 1/plx. So as plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number density should be uniform. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume of that region.

Let me think about this. If I consider a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr, then the volume of that shell is about 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² dr multiplied by some constant number density n (since they're uniformly distributed). 

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = -d/(plx²) d plx. Wait, because plx = 1/d, so d plx = - (1/d²) dd. Or, in terms of dr, let me do this carefully.

Let me express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. The shell's thickness dr is related to the change in plx. Let's think about a small change in plx, delta_plx. The corresponding change in distance would be delta_d = - (delta_plx)/(plx²). Because plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So delta_d ≈ -
