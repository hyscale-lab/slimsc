Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through each step carefully. Hmm, the question involves several reactions, so I'll need to track each transformation.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with excess KOH, I think this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, probably eliminating HBr. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. Heating with a strong base like KOH should lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So the product after KOH is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar.

Wait, the product is called product 1 and its NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where an OCH2 group might appear. Oh wait, wait, KOH is a base, but maybe it's an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. Alternatively, if it's dehydrohalogenation, perhaps it's forming an epoxide? No, because KOH isn't typically used for epoxidation. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form a double bond, but the NMR data suggests something else.

Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of an ester or ketone. Oh, wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, which is a strong base. Oh, wait, perhaps it's an example of the Hofmann elimination? No, Hofmann is more about amines. Alternatively, maybe the base is abstracting a proton, leading to the elimination of HBr twice, creating a diene. But the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe I got it wrong.

Wait, could the reaction be a hydrolysis instead? If both bromine atoms are eliminated as HBr, maybe forming an alkene. But why the IR shows a carbonyl? Oh wait, wait, perhaps it's a dehydration to form a ketone? No, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane doesn't have adjacent Hs to form a ketone upon elimination. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, another approach: the NMR data. The product has 1H NMR peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is likely an -OCH2- group, but wait, in what context? Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong peak, likely an ester (about 1740) or a ketone (around 1720). So, maybe the product is an ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a base-induced elimination that forms an epoxide. But then why the IR? Alternatively, maybe the base is causing a substitution to form an ether. Wait, if it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH, it's more likely an E2 elimination, forming a double bond. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Hmm, maybe the elimination forms something else.

Wait, perhaps the base is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane. Oh! Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br's across the structure. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming an alkene. So the product would be 1,3-diamantadiene or something similar. But the IR would show a peak around 1650 for a double bond, not 1720. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. How? If elimination happens, but maybe it's a cyclic ketone. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but
