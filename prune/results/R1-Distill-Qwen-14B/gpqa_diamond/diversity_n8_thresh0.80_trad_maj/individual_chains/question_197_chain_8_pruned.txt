Okay, I need to figure out the structure of Compound X based on the given IR and NMR data, and then determine what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the IR data: strong absorption between 3400-2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an alkyne. Also, the peak at 1720 cm-1 indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic ringsâ€”C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Then the 1H NMR data: Let's break it down.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid, which is usually a broad peak. But the integration is 1H. Alternatively, maybe an enol form? Or maybe it's an O-H from something else. Hmm.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. For example, if there's a substituent at para position, the H's on either side would be in two doublets. So maybe the structure has a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.

Looking at the integration, 2H each, so maybe two substituents in para positions, each having two equivalent H's. So perhaps a para-disubstituted benzene.

What about the other peaks?

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet. Maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. Or perhaps a methine (CH) group adjacent to a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for two protons, maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl or part of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet. A geminal group, maybe a CH(CH3)2 or something like that. Wait, a doublet with 3H usually means a methyl group attached to something that splits into a doublet. Oh, like a methyl group attached to a CH2, so maybe a CH(CH3) group. Alternatively, maybe a (CH2CH2CH3) structure.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with a substituent that is a chain leading to a carbonyl group. Let me think.

The IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which is a bit high for an ester (usually around 1740-1720 for esters, and maybe lower for ketones). But wait, 1720 could be a ketone or an ester. If it's a ketone, then the aldehyde proton at 10.5 might make sense if it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzoyl group attached to something else.

Wait, the IR also has a peak around 3400-2500. That might suggest an alkyne (sp-hybridized C-H stretch, which is higher) but more commonly, an O-H stretch. Oh, but the NMR doesn't show a broad peak that could be an O-H. Wait, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet. Could that be an aldehyde? Aldehyde protons are deshielded and appear around 9-10 ppm. A broad peak could suggest some hydrogen bonding, but aldehydes usually are sharp. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like a phenol, but then the aromatic ring would have more substituents.

Wait, perhaps the IR peak is due to an alkyne. Let me think about that. If there's an alkyne, the IR would show a strong peak around 3300 cm-1 for the C-H stretch. But the given IR starts at 3400-2500. Hmm, maybe it's an alcohol. But I don't see any broad peak in the NMR except at 10.5, which is higher than typical O-H (which is usually around 1-5 ppm). Wait, maybe that's an enol tautomer or a conjugated aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde. Let's think about the other NMR data.

Looking at the aromatic region: 8.0 and 7.2 as doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, a para-disubstituted benzene. So maybe the substituents are in para positions, perhaps a carbonyl group and another substituent.

Wait, but how does the carbonyl fit in? Let's think about the substituents on the benzene. If it's a para-substituted benzene, with substituents at positions 1 and 3 (wait no, that's ortho), wait, no, positions 1 and 4 are para. So substituents at 1 and 4.

Wait, perhaps the benzene is substituted with a carbonyl group and another group. Let me think about possible groups attached.

The 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde group attached to the benzene ring. So maybe a benzaldehyde derivative.

But then, looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's say, perhaps a CH group next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone. Wait, but then the carbonyl would be part of a ketone group.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an aldehyde and another substituent that's a chain leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group or something similar. Let me try to sketch this.

If the substituent is a propanoyl group (CH2CH2CO-), but that might not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group with a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the molecular formula. I don't have it, but perhaps the integration can help. The NMR has:

1H: 1 (10.5), 2 (8.0), 2 (7.2), 1 (2.9), 2 (1.7), 3 (1.4), 3 (0.9). So total H: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3 = 14 H. So molecular formula could be C10H14O? Or something else.

Wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so O is present.

Let me think about the substitution pattern. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, so probably a para-substituted benzene with
