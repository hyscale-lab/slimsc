Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me see. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions when there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex present. The given data includes the concentration of the complex and the formation constant, K. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions, right? So when EDTA binds to Ca²+, it forms a complex, and the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would depend on the formation constant and the total concentration of the complex.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think the formula for this complex is probably CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA part. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M.

I also remember the formation constant, K, which is given as 5x10^10. The formation constant is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA²−. The K expression for this would be K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, we may not need to worry about the EDTA concentration separately because the solution is stoichiometric, which I think means that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex. Oh, wait, no, not necessarily. Because some might dissociate.

So the question is, what's the free [Ca²+] in the solution? Since the complex is formed, some of the Ca²+ is in the complex and some is free. But the total concentration of Ca would be the sum of the free Ca²+ and the Ca in the complex. But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps that's the total concentration of Ca in the solution, which is all from the complex, meaning that the initial concentration of Ca²+ is zero, and the complex is formed from it. Or maybe the 0.02 M is the concentration of the complex, and some of it dissociates.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So I think that the total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. That is, [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. We can assume that the solution is such that the pH is ideal, so the EDT
