Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Alright, so I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), right? So in this case, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) depends on the temperature.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think the ratio n1/n2 (or maybe n2/n1) is given as 2. Let me think: If the excited level is higher, then n2 is the number in the excited state, and n1 is the lower. So if in star_1, n2 is twice that of star_2, then n2_1 = 2 * n2_2. Or wait, wait. The question says the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. So maybe it's the ratio n_excited /n_lower. So for star_1, that ratio is 2 times that of star_2. Or wait, maybe star_1 has twice the excitation as star_2. So n2_1 = 2 * n2_2.

Wait, but we're talking about the same energy levels for both stars, I think. So the energy difference is the same for both, E. So the ratio for each star is n2/n1 = exp( -E/(k T) ), but wait, which way is it? Because E is higher for the excited state, so the exponent would be negative. So n2 is the higher energy level.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), but I think the question is assuming that the statistical weights (g factors) are the same for both stars since it's the same element. So the ratio of populations is just exp( - delta E / (k T) ), where delta E is E2 - E
