Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D. Alright, let's break this down.

Wait, so the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. So the relative speed isn't simply 0.6c - 0.5c because that would be 0.1c, but I remember that's not how it works when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), right? But wait, wait, the problem says both are moving in the same direction. So the astronaut with the higher speed (0.6c) is moving faster than the other (0.5c). So from the perspective of the slower one, the relative speed is the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no. Let me think. If I'm on the slower astronaut's frame, the other is moving at (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/c²). So here, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. Wait, but wait, no: the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, but which one is u and which is v? Wait, the formula is for the velocity of an object as seen from a frame moving at velocity v relative to the original frame. So if I'm the 0.5c astronaut, the other is moving at 0.6c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate that.

So 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c², which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.142857c, so about 0.143c. So that's the relative speed. Looking at the options, option C has 0.14c as the relative speed, and option D also has 0.14c. So that part is either C or D. Let me note that.

Now for the total energy. The system's total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's total energy. Each one's energy is gamma times m c squared. So for each, we calculate their gamma factor.

Wait, let's compute each's energy. The first astronaut has mass 2m moving at 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So for 0.6c: v² = (0.6c)^2 = 0.36 c². So denominator in sqrt is 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Sqrt(0.64)=0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So energy is gamma * mass * c². So 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the astronaut's energy is gamma * m_rest c². So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m. So E1 = gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait a second. No, wait. Wait, no: the formula is E = gamma * m c², where m is the rest mass. So for the first astronaut, m is 2m, so E1 = gamma * 2m c². So let me compute gamma for 0.6c: 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25 c²/c²))= 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² = approx 3.464 m c².

So total energy is E1 + E2 = 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c, which matches with our earlier calculation of 0.1428 which is about 0.14c.

So the correct answer should be option C. Let's check the options again. Looking at option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Yes, that's what I calculated.

Wait, but why is option D's E=5 mc²? That seems too low. Let me recheck the calculations. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in gamma.

Wait, for the first astronaut:

v=0.6c.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25. Correct.

E1 = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c². That's correct.

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. gamma=1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2= gamma *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total E = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², which is approx 5.96 mc². So option C matches.

Wait, but why is option B's E=4.96 mc²? Maybe if I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.464. 2.5 + 3.464 is 5.964. So yeah, that's correct. So option C is the one with E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocities more accurately. Let me compute the relative speed exactly. So:

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ) = (0.1 c) / (1 - (0.3 c²)/c² ) = 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = 0.142857... c. So 0.142857c is approximately 0.14c. So yes, option C has 0.14c.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction with velocities \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), velocity \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), velocity \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).
- The total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**
