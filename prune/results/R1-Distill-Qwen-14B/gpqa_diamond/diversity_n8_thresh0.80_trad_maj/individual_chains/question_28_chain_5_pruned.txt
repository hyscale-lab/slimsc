Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to organic chemistry, but I'll give it a shot.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. So, I imagine a cyclohexenone ring with a hydroxyl group in the 4 position. The configuration is S, which I think I need to consider during the reactions.

The first step is treating this with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSCl) and triethylamine. I remember that silylation usually protects hydroxyl groups. So the hydroxyl on the cyclohexenone will get a silyl protecting group. The product 1 should have the hydroxyl replaced by a TBS group. So the structure becomes 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 2. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which probably does a conjugate addition. The cyclohexenone has a conjugated double bond, so the Gilman reagent would add to the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. The addition would occur in a way that the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, giving a new substituent on the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, the cuprate adds to the ketone. So the cyclohexenone (2-en-1-one) would have the enone structure. The cuprate would add to the carbonyl, making a new carbon-carbon bond. The addition orientation: for a conjugate addition, I think the cuprate adds to the beta position. So, the reaction would form a new single bond in the ring.

But wait, I might be mixing things up. Gilman reagents do 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) to alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. So the structure would add a benzyl group (from benzyl bromide) at the beta position.

Wait, no. Wait, the reagent is Ph2CuLi. When you add to the enone, the cuprate will attack the carbonyl carbon. The addition would lead to the formation of a new ring substituent. So the cyclohexenone would have the TBS group at C4, the ketone at C1, and the double bond between C2 and C3.

So, the cuprate (Ph2Cu-) would add to C2, the same as the double bond? Or wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. The enone has the structure where the carbonyl is at C1, the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the hydroxyl is at C4 (now protected as TBS). So the enone is cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

So, when Ph2CuLi is added, the cuprate will attack the carbonyl at C1, opening the enone. Then, after workup with benzyl bromide, which I think is an alkylation step. Hmm, maybe the cuprate adds, and then the benzyl group comes in.

Wait, the sequence is treatment with Ph2CuLi followed by benzyl bromide. So perhaps the first step is a conjugate addition. Wait, no, because the cuprate would do a 1,2-addition or 1,4? I think in this case, it's a 1,2-addition because the enone is part of a ring, and the TBS group is in a specific position.

Alternatively, maybe it's a hydride shift followed by addition. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

When you have an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone), a Grignard or organocuprate reagent will typically add in a 1,4-manner (conjugate addition), adding the nucleophile to the beta carbon, and the alkoxide to the alpha carbon. So the cuprate would attack the beta position (C3 in this case), and the oxygen would take a proton from somewhere.

So starting with cyclohex-2-en-1-one, the cuprate adds to C3, making a new bond there. Then, after the workup with benzyl bromide, which is an alkylating agent, perhaps we get some kind of alkylation.

Wait, no. Oh, wait, the process is: first, the organocuprate adds to the enone, forming an alkoxide. Then, when you add benzyl bromide, it's an SN2 reaction, where the benzyl group would substitute the leaving group (but wait, in that case, what is the leaving group?) Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another possibility: the cuprate adds to the carbonyl oxygen, making a new carbon-carbon bond at the alpha position, and then the benzyl bromide acts as an electrophile. Maybe the cuprate adds a benzyl group to the alpha position.

Alternatively, perhaps the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, forming a new carbon center, and then the benzyl bromide is a methylating agent? No, wait, benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, so perhaps it's adding a benzyl group.

Wait, let's think in terms of the mechanism. The starting material is 4-TBS-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Step 1: Ph2CuLi adds to the enone. The cuprate is a strong nucleophile. It will attack the carbonyl carbon, performing a 1,2-addition. That would form a new single bond at C2, and the oxygen would have a negative charge. Then, perhaps the benzyl bromide would protonate the oxygen, but more likely, maybe the benzyl acts as an electrophile in an alkylation step.

Wait, perhaps the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, giving an intermediate that can then undergo a substitution. Or maybe the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, making an enolate, which can then react with benzyl bromide.

Alternatively, the cuprate adds to the alpha position, leading to a new substituent. So, perhaps the product after the first step (cuprate addition) would have the benzyl group added to the ring.

Wait, another thought: when the cuprate adds to an enone, it can perform a conjugate addition (1,4) or a direct addition (1,2). In this case, since the ring is small, perhaps the 1,2 addition is favored. So the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, making a new substituent.

Wait, perhaps the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, and then the benzyl bromide provides a benzyl group as a substituent.

Wait, maybe I should think of this as a two-step process:
