Okay, so I've got this question here about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question lists four compounds and asks which of them can exhibit optical isomerism. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each combining numbers 1-4. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has a chiral center, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So I need to check each compound for the presence of such centers.

Let me go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, that's a mouthful. So it's a biphenyl structure, right? The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. Now, substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' on the nitro groups. I'm thinking about if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetrical, maybe it's not chiral. Wait, the substituents are on both rings. Let's see: each phenyl has two substituents, methyl esters and nitro groups. If the arrangement is such that there's no symmetry, then maybe it's chiral. Or maybe the biphenyl itself can have E and Z configurations? Wait, no, biphenyls have rotation around the central bond, but if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and has a central point of inversion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents cause the molecule to have a chiral center. Wait, the substituents are on the phenyl rings. But the ester groups are at 2 and 2', so are those positions symmetric? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I'll come back to this one.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, the structure is an ester. The propanoate part is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COO- with a methyl ester. So, the structure looks like: O=COCH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Let me draw it. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Its ester would be CH2CH2COO-R. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the molecule would have a hydroxyl group on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons. Wait, wait: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)COOCH3 attached to another CH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-, and when esterified with methyl, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)CH2-

Wait, no, perhaps it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? No, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's count the carbons. Propanoate has three carbons. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the acid, and the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but looking at the central carbon: the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon. So the carbon chain is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but the carbon with the hydroxyl is the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, because propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the hydroxyl on the first carbon of the propanoate. Oh wait, I'm getting the numbering wrong. Propanoate is:

Carboxylic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the ester is CH3CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate. Wait, the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so numbering from the COO group. So the first carbon is the CH2 adjacent to COO, the second is next. So 2-hydroxy would be on that second CH2. Wait, but that's the same as the first CH2 in the chain?

Wait, perhaps a better approach: for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)-CH2-

Wait, no, I'm getting myself more confused. Maybe it's better to imagine the molecule. The propanoate is a three-carbon chain, with the COO group on the end. So the carbons are:

COOCH3 – CH(OH) – CH3? Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate: the COO is on C1, C2 is the OH-bearing carbon, and C3 is methyl.

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the carbon with the OH is the second carbon. Now, looking at that carbon: it's connected to OH, two CH3 groups (one from the adjacent C, and the other from the C-OCH3?), wait no. Let me draw it:

The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- One CH3 (from CH3-CH(OH)-)
- One COOCH3 group (from -CH(OH)-COOCH3)
- One OH group
- And another CH3? Wait no, that can't be. Wait, no, the central carbon is CH, connected to:

- CH3 (the first carbon)
- COOCH3 (the third carbon)
- OH
- And a H? Because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, I think the carbon with OH has four substituents. Let me count:

- One CH3 (from CH3-)
- One CH2 (from CH2-COOCH3? No, wait. Maybe it's more like:

The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon, CH3-)
- CH(OH) connected to the first and third carbons.
Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the molecule as:

The propanoate group is: O-CO-OCH3 attached to a CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

No, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but that would make the propanoate have a longer chain. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

But regardless, if the molecule has a carbon with four different substituents, it's a chiral center. So, for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the central carbon (the one with OH) has:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- One COOCH3 group
- One OH group
- And one hydrogen?

Wait, that would make four different substituents. So that carbon is chiral, which means the molecule can have optical isomerism. So compound 2 can exhibit optical isomerism. So it's positive.

3. Benzophenone. That's a ketone, with two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. Structure is Ar-CO-Ar, where Ar is phenyl. So the molecule is (Ph)2CO. Now, does this have any chiral centers? The carbonyl is in the middle, and both sides are phenyl groups. So the molecule is symmetrical. There's a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group, so the molecule is achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism. So compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is an ester derived from fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Its structure is (Z)-1,2-dihydroxyethylene dicarboxylic acid. When esterified with methanol, dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2(COOCH3)2, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, which has the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides, making it a trans-diepoxy structure. Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans-diepoxy. So the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

But wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is CH2CH(COOH)2 in trans configuration. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2CH(COOCH3)2 in the trans configuration. Alternatively, it's two ester groups on opposite sides of a double bond. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. Let me think: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but in the trans configuration across the double bond. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the ester would be OMe groups instead of OH. So the structure would be MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, but in the trans configuration.

So dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, and each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. Now, can this molecule have stereoisomerism? Well, since it's a diastereomer, but does it have any chiral centers? Let's see: each of the carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. Wait, each C of the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? No, wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2-COOCH3

No, wait, that's not right. Fumarate has a double bond between the two carbons. So each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and perhaps a CH2. Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides (trans). So the ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the same trans configuration. So each of the CH carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups attached. So each of those carbons is bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3), the double bond, and a hydrogen. Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure: each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a hydrogen. So each of those carbons has substituents: COOCH3, COOCH3, H, and the double bond. Wait, no, a double bond is between two carbons, so each carbon is bonded to two substituents. So each C in the double bond is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs. Wait, no, because it's a trans configuration.

Wait, maybe it's more accurate to say that each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a COOCH3 group on each end, and a hydrogen on each. So each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs. So each of those carbons has the same substituents, so they are not chiral centers. So the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, because it's a double bond, can it have E/Z isomerism? Yes, but that's a different type of isomerism, not optical isomerism.

Wait, but optical isomerism comes from chiral centers. So if a molecule has a double bond but no chiral centers, it can't exhibit optical isomerism. However, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule itself is chiral due to some other arrangement, even without a chiral center. Wait, can a molecule without any chiral centers be chiral? Yes, like benzene with certain substituents, but in this case, I think dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. Because the two substituents on each end are the same (COOCH3 groups), and the molecule is symmetric across the double bond. So maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, but in this case, it's symmetric.

Wait, wait. Let me think: for a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry. So in dimethyl fumarate, because the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same (two COOCH3 groups each), the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism because it's not chiral. Wait, but wait a second—could there be another reason? Like, if the molecule has a center of inversion or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is actually a meso compound. Wait, no, because fumarate itself is not a meso compound. Fumarate (the acid) is a trans-dicarboxylic acid, and when esterified, the ester would still have the same arrangement. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same. Wait, in this case, the substituents are both COOCH3 groups. So each end is the same, making the molecule symmetric. So no chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, could the molecule have a double bond and some type of stereoisomerism other than optical?

Wait, maybe the question is about whether any of the compounds exhibit stereoisomerism, but the question specifically says optical isomerism, which is about enantiomers. So since dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't have optical isomerism. So compound 4 won't show optical isomerism. Wait, but wait—I might be mixing up things. Let me think again: maleic acid is cis, fumaric is trans. When they form the diesters, maleic becomes a meso compound (dimethyl maleate is a meso compound, so it's achiral), while fumarate is a trans diastereomer. Wait, no—dimethyl maleate is a meso compound, so it's achiral, but dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer and also a trans isomer. But does that make it chiral?

Wait, actually, no. Because in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two central carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So each of those carbons has two identical substituents, so they're not chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule as a whole doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not chiral. Therefore, it cannot exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought: what about the possibility of the molecule being a planar structure, making it non-chiral? Or is there any possibility that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the structure of dimethyl fumarate. It's (Z) or (E)? Wait, no, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer. So the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
C=C
    /
COOCH3

But arranged in a trans configuration. So each of the central carbons has two COOCH3 groups and two Hs. So each is bonded to two of each, making them not chiral. So no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about if the molecule is not symmetrical? For example, if the substituents are different on each end, but in this case, they're the same. So yeah, it's symmetrical. So no optical isomerism.

So reviewing the four compounds:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I need to check if this has a chiral center. So the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 2' positions (dicarboxylate groups) and 6,6' have nitro groups. Let me imagine the structure: Each phenyl ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. Now, the biphenyl can have a certain arrangement. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule might be chiral.

Wait, the biphenyl has two rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it can be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, if the two rings each have a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, but arranged in a way that the substituents on each ring are symmetric around the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For example, if substituents on each ring are mirrored across the central bond, then the molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that the substituents are not symmetric, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and thus be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Hmm, how can I assess this? Let's think of the positions. The 6 and 2 positions on each ring are across from each other in a phenyl ring. So if the substituents are at 6 and 2 on each ring, and the rings are connected such that substituents are opposite each other, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. But without a clear structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two rings, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are in such a way that when you rotate one ring relative to the other, the arrangement is mirrored, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So I'm not sure about this one. Maybe I should look for another way.

Another approach: if the compound has a stereogenic center. Are there any carbons in the molecule that have four different substituents? Let me think.

The biphenyl rings themselves don't have chiral centers because they're flat, but maybe the ester groups are attached in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere.

Each ester group is a carbonyl connected to an oxygen. So the ester groups are O-CO-OCH3, attached to the biphenyl rings. The point of attachment is at position 2 on each ring. So the carbons attached to the ester groups are each connected to:

- The biphenyl ring (two substituents, as it's a benzene ring)
- A COOCH3 group.

Wait, but the carbon attached to the ester would have three substituents: two from the benzene ring and one from the ester. No, wait, in the biphenyl, each ring's carbon is part of the aromatic ring. So the carbon at position 2 would be attached to the ring, a COOCH3 group, and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, but in an aromatic ring, each carbon is bonded to three other atoms (like in benzene). So the position 2 in the biphenyl would have the ring bonds, the ester group, and a hydrogen. So that carbon would have four substituents: two from the ring (each as part of the benzene), the ester group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but in reality, each ring is a benzene ring, so each position has a single bond. The carbons in the ring are sp2 hybridized, so each has three substituents. So the carbon at position 2 would have:

- Two other carbons from the ring (as in, the ring structure)
- The ester group (as a substituent)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but that's three substituents plus a hydrogen, making four? No, wait, perhaps I'm muddling that up. Each carbon in the benzene ring is bonded to three other carbons in the ring and a substituent. So position 2 would have the substituent (like COOCH3), and two adjacent ring carbons, and a hydrogen. So that's four substituents: two from the ring (as part of the ring structure), the substituent, and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent is on a sp2 carbon. So, is that carbon a chiral center? No, because sp2 hybridized carbons can't be chiral centers. Chiral centers must be sp3 hybridized with four different substituents. So the carbon in the benzene ring is sp2, so it's not a chiral center.

So the ester groups are attached to the benzene rings, but their points of attachment are sp2 carbons, which can't be chiral. Are there any other carbons in the molecule that are sp3 and have four different groups?

The ester group is O-CO-OCH3. The oxygen is connected to the carbonyl, which is connected to another oxygen, which is connected to a methyl group. So the carbonyl is a double bond, so the carbons in the ester group are not chiral.

Wait, but the carbon in the ester group (the one attached to the oxygen) is part of the carbonyl, so it's sp2 hybridized. So no chiral centers there.

So, if the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, then it can't exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not 100% confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere, but I can't see it.

Wait, another thought: the biphenyl structure itself can have different conformations, but unless there's a fixed configuration that leads to chirality, it's not relevant. The question is about isomerism, which is about the structure of the molecule, not conformation.

So, I'm starting to lean towards thinking that compound 1 doesn't have any chiral centers either. Thus, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another angle: maybe the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in a way that causes the molecule to be chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say definitively.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral axis or something else. But I'm not certain, so maybe it's better to make an educated guess.

So, revisiting the four compounds:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: I'm unsure, but perhaps it's not chiral.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Definitely has a chiral center, so yes.

3. Benzophenone: No.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: No.

So if that's the case, which options include 2 but not others? Looking at the answer options, option A says 1,2,4. Option D says 1 and 2. But I'm not confident about 1.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. Let me think again: if the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged asymmetrically, making the molecule chiral.

Wait, in the biphenyl, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The 6 position is opposite to the point where the two rings are connected. So, if the substituents are arranged such that on each ring, the nitro and ester groups are on opposite sides relative to the connecting bond, perhaps the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the central bond, making it achiral.

Hmm. Another approach: if the substituents are at positions that are symmetric relative to the central bond, then the molecule would be achiral. For example, if each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2, and the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that no plane of symmetry exists, the molecule would be chiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the nitro groups and ester groups on each ring creates a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are mirror images. For example, if the nitro and ester groups are arranged symmetrically on each ring, the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that each ring is identical, making the entire molecule symmetrical. So, perhaps each ring has a nitro group and an ester group, and the arrangement on each ring is the same. So the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral.

In that case, compound 1 would not exhibit optical isomerism.

So, based on all that, the only compound that definitely shows optical isomerism is compound 2.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me look at the options again:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → So A includes 2, which is correct, but also 1 and 4, which I thought are incorrect. But I'm not sure about 1.

B) 3 and 4 → both incorrect as per my analysis.

C) 2 and 3 → 3 is incorrect.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 may or may not.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me re-examine it.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2. No, wait, it's (E) configuration across the double bond. But the issue is whether it has any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups. So each of those carbons has two identical substituents, so they’re not chiral centers. Thus, the molecule doesn’t have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So the only compound that definitely has optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options, option A includes 2, but also 1 and 4. None of the options have only 2 as correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to revisit compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So each phenyl ring has nitro groups at 6 and 6', and ester groups at 2 and 2'. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1'.

So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other (since in a benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are across from each other).

Wait, let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 (which is across from position 1) and an ester group at position 2 (which is adjacent to position 1).

So on each ring, substituents are at position 2 (ester) and position 6 (nitro), which is the position opposite to the connecting bond.

So, for each ring, the ester is at 2 (adjacent to the connecting bond) and the nitro at 6 (opposite). Now, if the two rings have their substituents arranged in a way that they mirror each other, the molecule could be symmetrical.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, then it's achiral. Suppose the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically across the central bond. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side relative to the central bond, and the ester groups are on the opposite side, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tough. However, in some cases, such compounds can be chiral. For example, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. If so, it would be achiral.

I think I'm stuck on this one, but based on what I know, the only compound that definitely shows optical isomerism is 2.

But looking at the options again, option A includes 2, but I'm not confident about 1 and 4. Let me look for another angle.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 can exhibit geometric isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. So it's not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility that compound 1 is a diastereomer. But that's still not optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center somewhere else, perhaps in the ester group. But the ester groups are attached to the benzene rings, which are sp2, so no chiral centers there.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups create a chiral center elsewhere, but that's not likely.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but looking at the options, I can't find an option that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me recheck compound 4. Dimethyl fumarate. Structure: (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, no. Fumarate is (E)-1,2-dicarboxyethyl ester. So the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
C=C
    /
COOCH3

In the E configuration. So each of the central carbons is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs. So each of those carbons is bonded to two identical groups. Therefore, no chiral centers. So no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that definitely can show optical isomerism is 2. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again: is dimethyl fumarate a chiral molecule? Or is it not, because it's a meso compound?

Wait, no, because all four substituents on each carbon in the double bond are identical (two COOCH3 and two Hs), so they are not chiral centers. So the molecule as a whole isn't chiral.

So, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2.

B)3 and4→ both incorrect.

C)2 and3→ 3 is incorrect.

D)1 and2→ 1 is questionable.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. Let me think again. Maybe the molecule is chiral.

In compound 1, the biphenyl has substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents are nitro and ester groups. If the arrangement of these groups is such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral.

Imagine that on each phenyl ring, the nitro group is on one side and the ester group is on the opposite side relative to the central bond. If the arrangement on each ring is such that the substituents are not mirrored across the central bond, the molecule would be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on both rings are arranged in a way that they're not symmetrical, the molecule would have a chiral center. But wait, the biphenyl itself doesn't have a chiral center; the substituents are on the rings.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule has a chiral axis or a plane, but that's more about symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has multiple stereogenic centers.

Wait, maybe the biphenyl structure has a certain configuration that leads to chirality. For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry.

But without a clear understanding of the structure, it's hard to say. However, let's consider that if the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

So, if the substituents on each ring are in a way that they're not mirror images, the molecule would be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, perhaps compound 1 does show optical isomerism, as it's a chiral molecule.

If that's the case, then which options include 1 and 2?

Looking at the options, option A includes 1,2,4; option D includes 1 and 2.

But if only 1 and 2 are correct, then option D would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 doesn't show optical isomerism, so option A would include 4, which I think is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D: 1 and 2. Because both 1 and 2 can exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely certain about 1. Alternatively, perhaps only 2 is correct, but none of the options match that.

Wait, another angle: maybe compound 4 doesn't have optical isomerism, but it can have geometric isomerism (E and Z). But that's different from optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option A (1,2,4) or option D (1 and 2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism, making only 2 correct, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Let me think again about compound 4. Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)2. No, wait, no. Wait, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Each of the carbons in the double bond has two COOCH3 groups. So each carbon has two identical substituents. So no chiral centers. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options. The only compounds that have optical isomerism are 2 and possibly 1.

So, if option D is 1 and 2, that's the choice.

But if I'm unsure about 1, perhaps the correct answer is only 2, but since that's not an option, I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me consider if dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Wait, that's not possible because each of the central carbons has two identical substituents. So, no.

So, perhaps only 2 and 1 are correct, making option D the choice. But I'm not 100% sure about 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that compound 1 doesn't have any chiral centers, making only 2 correct, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating and should make a decision based on the analysis.

So, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 2 and possibly 1. Among the options, the only one that includes 2 is A and D and C.

Wait, option A includes 1,2,4. But 1 and 4 I'm unsure about.

But based on the analysis, I think only 2 is correct, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about compound 4. Let me think again: is there any possibility that dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center?

Wait, no. Because each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs. So, each of those carbons has two identical substituents, so they are not chiral centers.

Thus, the only compound that definitely shows optical isomerism is 2.

Wait, but looking again at the options, none of them have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that compound 4 has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, but perhaps another factor makes it chiral.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think the most confident answer is that only 2 shows optical isomerism, but since none of the options is just 2, perhaps I'm mistaken elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: maybe compound 1 is chiral because the substituents on the biphenyl create a chiral environment. For instance, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Thus, I'll go with option A: 1,2,4. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is A) 1, 2 and 4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps only 2 is correct, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, another angle: if the biphenyl has substituents that are in a non-symmetrical arrangement, it would have a chiral center. For example, if the substituents are arranged so that one ring's substituents are mirror images of the other, then the molecule would be achiral. But if not, it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But without knowing for sure, perhaps I should choose the option that includes 2, which is option A and D.

If I have to choose between the options, and considering that in my analysis only 2 is correct, but none of the options match, perhaps the correct option is A.

Wait, but option A includes 4, which I believe is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is only 2, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think: which of these compounds can have enantiomers?

Enantiomers arise from chiral centers.

So:

1. If the molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers.

2. Definitely has a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

So, if 1 has a chiral center, then it can have enantiomers.

Thus, the answer would include 1 and 2.

So, looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

Thus, the answer is D.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other features that make the molecule chiral.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents include nitro groups and ester groups. The biphenyl structure can lack a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, making the molecule chiral. Based on this reasoning, **this compound can exhibit optical isomerism**.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon atom at the second position (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center. Therefore, **this compound exhibits optical isomerism**.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The molecule is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry through the carbonyl group. Since it is achiral, **this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2 in the trans (E) configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical groups (COOCH3 and H), so there are no chiral centers. While it exhibits geometric isomerism (E/Z), it does not exhibit optical isomerism. **This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism**.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1: Exhibits optical isomerism.  
- Compound 2: Exhibits optical isomerism.  
- Compound 3: Does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
- Compound 4: Does not exhibit optical isomerism.  

The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **1 and 2**. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: D**
