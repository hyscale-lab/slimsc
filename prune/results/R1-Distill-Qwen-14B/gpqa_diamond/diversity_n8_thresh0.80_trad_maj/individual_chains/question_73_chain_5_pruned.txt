Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. So, they're moving in the same direction, which is important for calculating the relative speed.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the speeds normally because that would give an answer faster than the speed of light, which isn't possible. So I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity must be used here. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Or is that when they're moving in opposite directions? Wait, no, I think that's correct. Because when they're moving in the same direction, their relative speed is (u - v) divided by (1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared).

So let me plug in the values. The first astronaut's speed is u = 0.6c, and the second is v = 0.5c. So the numerator would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that: 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, multiplied by c squared, so 0.3c² over c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) = 0.142857... c, which is approximately 0.143c. So looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c, which is close. So that's one part done.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, so I need to calculate their energies and sum them. The relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
