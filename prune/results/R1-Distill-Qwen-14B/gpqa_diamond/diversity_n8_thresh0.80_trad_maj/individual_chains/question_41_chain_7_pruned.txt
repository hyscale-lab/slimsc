Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things get a bit tricky, especially with relativity and all.

The question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. So the observer is watching the light beam go through this moving glass.

I recall that the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? Because when the medium is moving, the observed speed might change, but wait, noâ€”because according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But here, the light is in a medium, so maybe it's different.

Wait, but what about the glass's motion. So, in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, what's the speed?

I think this is a problem where I need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because we're dealing with relative velocities.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula applies to objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, but here, the medium is moving at velocity
