Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, the setup is that we have a large number of identical systems—10,000 particles, each in the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position of these particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a.' The options are A through D, with some numbers.

Alright, let me think. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding the particle at a particular position. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

The wave function given is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex function. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So, the modulus squared is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because |ψ|² is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. Oh right, because when you have a complex number ψ = A + iB, then |ψ|² = A² + B².

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. The integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me break this integral into two parts. Let's call the first part Integral 1 and the second part Integral 2.

Integral 1: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

Integral 2: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3.

Compute Integral 1: The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. Evaluated from 1 to 3.

So, Integral 1 = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Integral 2: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So, the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): I know ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So, a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 → 0.5 divided by about 0.6931.

Let me calculate that: 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7208.

So, a² ≈ 0.7208 → a is the square root of that. sqrt(0.7208) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer?

Wait, but wait a second. The question says that none were found at x <1 or x>3. So the wave function must be zero outside of 1 and 3. However, the given wave function is ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. Wait, but this wave function is given for the region where the particles can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So I think the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, but within 1 to 3, it's this function.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So perhaps this is only valid in the region x between 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero elsewhere. But when we normalized, we integrated from 1 to 3, which is correct.

Wait, but when I set up the normalization condition, I correctly integrated over the region where the wave function is non-zero, which is between 1 and 3. So the calculation should be correct.

So a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is proportional to \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), so the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \),
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \).

For the first integral, \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx \), the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

For the second integral, \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \), the result is:

\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7208 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7208} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
