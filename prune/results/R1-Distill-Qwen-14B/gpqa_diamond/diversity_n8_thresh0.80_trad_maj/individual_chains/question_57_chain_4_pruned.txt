Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the electrons have 50 MeV of energy. I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, which are all in fm, so whatever the calculation is, the units must come out to that.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, especially in the context of partial waves, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed as a sum over all the partial waves. The general formula is something like f = (1/k) * Σ (2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} * sin(δ_l), where the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum value, and k is the wave number. Oh wait, but the problem specifies to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond those given. So in our case, l goes from 0 to 4, I think.

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So what's the direction of the incident beam? I think that's when the scattering angle θ is zero, because the beam is along the initial direction. So the scattering is head-on? Or maybe it's when the scattered particle moves in the same direction as the incident beam. Hmm... but for the amplitude, I think when θ=0, the direction is along the beam.

Wait no, maybe I should think about the form of the scattering amplitude. The scattering amplitude f is a complex function, and in the case of elastic scattering, it's often expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) [e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. Oh wait, no, more accurately, it's (1/(2i)) times something, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the formula I'm recalling is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), where δ_l are the phase shifts for each l.

Wait, but another approach: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the total cross-section. Because the optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total is (4π/ k²) times the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (k is the wave number). So Im(f) at θ=0 is (k²/(4π)) * σ_total / (4π) ? Wait, no, the optical theorem states that 4π k Im(f(0)) = σ_total. Because f(0) is the forward scattering amplitude.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recap. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section is given by σ_total = (4π/k²) Im(f(0)), where f(0) is the scattering amplitude at θ=0. So if I can compute f(0), then I can take its imaginary part to find σ_total. But wait, wait, the question is directly asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, which is f(0) itself. Because the scattering amplitude is a function of θ and φ. So the question is essentially asking for Im(f(0)).

So, how do I compute f(0)? Well, f(θ) is given by the sum over l of (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), all multiplied by 1/(k) ?

Wait, no, the exact formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ
