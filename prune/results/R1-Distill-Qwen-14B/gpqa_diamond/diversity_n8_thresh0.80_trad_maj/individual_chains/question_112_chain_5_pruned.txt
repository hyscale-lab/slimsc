Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, not necessarily normalized. Oh wait, right, in quantum mechanics, states are vectors, and to find probabilities, we need to normalize them so that the total probability is 1.

So let's denote |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a is (1+i) and b is (2-i). The normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. So I need to compute |1+i|^2 and |2-i|^2.

Calculating |1+i|^2: the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for a complex number z = x + iy, |z|^2 is x^2 + y^2. So (1)^2 is 1, (1)^2 is 1, so 1+1=2.

Then |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 is 4, (-1)^2 is 1, so 4+1=5.

Adding these together, 2 +5 =7. So the total magnitude squared is 7. Therefore, the normalized state is (1+i)/√7 |up> + (2-i)/√7 |down>.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it just says the state is proportional to that, so the actual state is that divided by sqrt(7), right?

Next part of the problem: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix Aij. Aij is given as hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So let's think about what this matrix looks like.

Wait, since |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the spin-z operator, the basis is two-dimensional. So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix.

A matrix where A_ij is hbar/2 for i≠j and 0 otherwise. So in a two-dimensional basis, the matrix would be:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0    ]

Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, that matrix looks familiar. Oh wait, that's similar to the Pauli X matrix, except scaled. The Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply by hbar/2, this operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, but the question says the eigenstates of this operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Because the measurement probabilities depend on the projection of |alpha> onto these eigenstates.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since we're dealing with operator A, which is a linear operator, the possible measurement outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared modulus of the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenvector.

So first, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is:

0       hbar/2
hbar/2 0

So to find the eigenvalues, solve det(A - λI)=0.

The determinant is [0 - λ][0 - λ] - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar^2/4) =0.

So λ^2 = hbar^2/4 → λ= ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenvectors for each eigenvalue can be found. Let's do that.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - (hbar/2) I) v = 0.

The matrix becomes:

(-hbar/2)
