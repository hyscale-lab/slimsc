Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} would be the field strength tensor, which in electromagnetism is the Maxwell tensor. So this looks like a term involving the interaction between fermions (since there's a ψ and ψ̄) and some bosonic field, probably the photon because of F^{μν}.

I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension equal to 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ=c=1). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 since the integral over spacetime (which has dimension 4) times the Lagrangian must be dimensionless.

So the Lagrangian term here is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break down the dimensions of each part.

The Dirac fields ψ and ψ̄ have mass dimension 3/2 each because ψ has dimension (3 - 1)/2 = 1, wait no. Wait, Dirac spinor fields ψ have mass dimension (3 - 1)/2 + 1? Let me think: the action is ∫ L d^4x, so each term in L has dimension 4. The kinetic term for a Dirac field is something like ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So ψ̄ i γ ∂ ψ would have dimensions: ψ̄ has [ψ̄] = 3/2, ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. So (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 (from ∂_μ) = 4. So that works. So each ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, what about F^{μν}? The field strength tensor F is defined as ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each A has dimension 1, since ∂ is dimension 1, and A is a vector potential. So F^{μν} has dimension 2, because each derivative is dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, so each term in F is ∂A, which is 1+1=2. So F has dimension 2.

Next, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is just a matrix, so its dimension is 0. So when we look at the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ, each ψ is 3/2, so 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then multiplied by F^{μν} which is 2, so the whole term is 3 + 2 =5. But wait, the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4. So the product κ (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must have dimension 4. But wait, the product is (κ) [ψ̄ σ ψ] [F], which is [κ][3][2] = [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5 = 4. So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, that makes sense. So the mass dimension of κ is -1, which matches option A or C.

Now, about renormalizability. For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimension. Because if a coupling has a negative mass dimension, it implies that the interaction is relevant or irrelevant. Wait, wait: Wait, actually, in terms of renormalization, the coupling's dimension affects the superficial degree of divergence and the renormalizability. If a term in the Lagrangian has a coupling with a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because each vertex would bring in a high momentum factor. Let me think more carefully.

In general, a term in the Lagrangian has a structure like g φ^n, where g is the coupling. The dimension of the coupling is [g] = D - (d φ), where d φ is the dimension of each field φ. For renormalizability, we need [g] ≥ 0. Because if [g] is negative, each vertex contributes a factor of g, which would be like 1/(momentum)^|D|, leading to bad high-energy behavior. So in this case, [κ] is -1, which is negative. So the interaction term is non-renormalizable, which means the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ] is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking back at the options, option C says [κ]_M = -1 and theory isn't renormalizable. Option A says the theory is renormalizable, which would be incorrect.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields and operators
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, defined as $F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu$, has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The operator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a product of gamma matrices and is dimensionless, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units. Breaking down the dimensions of the term:
\[
[\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [F^{\mu\nu}].
\]
Substituting the known dimensions:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[\kappa] + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
For a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. A negative mass dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
