Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about two reactions with different reducing agents, and I need to find the starting materials A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, wait. Let me think. So each starting material A and B is treated with a different reducing agent. The products are enantiomers because one is R and the other is S. That makes sense because the configuration is opposite.

The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in THF or similar solvents. BH3, on the other hand, is a milder reducing agent. Oh wait, no, actually, BH3 is typically used in the formation of alcohols from ketones via hydroboration. Wait, no, hydroboration uses BH3 followed by something else.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the context. The products are tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one derivatives. That structure—pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, right? So it's a cyclic ether with a ketone group. The substituents are ethyl and the ring is tetrahydro, so it's a saturated ring—like a tetrahydropyran (THP) ring.

The product is 4-ethyl, meaning there's an ethyl group on carbon 4. The starting materials must then be something that, upon reduction, would form this THP ring. Oh, wait, maybe the starting materials are ketones or esters?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible mechanisms. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters, ketones, maybe even some other groups. BH3, though, I think in some cases is used in the formation of alcohols from carbonyl groups, but wait, when BH3 is used, it's often in the context of hydroboration, which is more about adding to alkenes, not carbonyls.

Wait, no. Alternatively, BH3 might be a reducing agent for esters or ketones. Wait, LiBH4 is more reactive and can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, an ester RCOOR' would be reduced by LiBH4 to RCH2OH and R'OH. Wait, but in this case, the product is a ring, so perhaps the starting material is
