Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this embryology question about creating a mouse embryonic chimera using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Hmm, let me break this down. 

The question describes an experiment where iPSCs from various tissues are labeled with mRaspberry under a lineage-specific promoter. They're injected into a 32-cell blastocyst and then tracked over 48 hours. They're using TUNEL-FITC staining and looking under a confocal microscope every 12 hours. The options are about what the first thing they notice would be.

Wait, okay, let me think about each part. So, the iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry, which is a red fluorescent protein, right? And this is under a lineage-specific promoter, which means each cell type (like maybe muscle, liver, etc.) will have a specific promoter driving the expression of mRaspberry. So each iPSC type should glow red in their specific tissues.

They're injected into a blastocyst at the 32-cell stage. I remember that the blastocyst is the stage where the inner cell mass (ICM) is present, which will form the embryo, and the trophectoderm, which forms the placenta. When you inject foreign cells into the blastocyst, they can integrate into the ICM and contribute to the embryo's tissues. Since these are iPSCs, they should be pluripotent and can differentiate into various cell types.

Now, the tracking is done every 12 hours for 48 hours, so four time points. They're using TUNEL-FITC. Oh, TUNEL is Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, which is used to detect DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells. So the green signal (FITC) is where apoptosis is happening. 

So what's the first thing they'd notice? Let's think about the timeline. When iPSCs are injected into the blastocyst, they might start migrating and differentiating. But initially, perhaps before they've started differentiating, maybe there's some stress or cell death happening. Or maybe the process of integrating into the blastocyst triggers some apoptosis.

Wait, but TUNEL detects apoptotic cells. If the injected iPSCs are undergoing apoptosis, then where would the signals be? The red is the mRaspberry in the iPSC derivatives. So if the cells are dying, would the red and green signals colocalize? Or perhaps the host cells are dying?

Alternatively, maybe the iPSCs are not dying, but the host embryo is undergoing normal cell death processes. But wait, in the early embryo, I'm not sure how much apoptosis occurs. But if the green is TUNEL, which is apoptotic events, and the red is the iPSCs, perhaps at the first observation, the iPSCs are not yet involved in apoptosis.

Wait, but the question is about the first thing you notice. So perhaps when you first look after injection, maybe within the first 12 hours, the cells have started to die. Alternatively, maybe the host cells are undergoing apoptosis, but the red cells are not. Or perhaps the red cells are colocalizing with the green.

Alternatively, perhaps the mRaspberry is in the nucleus, and if the cells are apoptotic, the nucleus would be undergoing condensation. But I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, another angle: the mRaspberry is under lineage-specific promoters. So each cell type would have different expression. If the cells are just injected, maybe they haven't started differentiating yet. So perhaps the red signal is present but not in any specific pattern. But why would the green signal be present?

Alternatively, if the cells are apoptotic, then in the initial stages, maybe the injected cells are undergoing apoptosis. So the red (mRaspberry) would be in the cells, and the TUNEL (green) would be in the same cells, leading to colocalization. So option B says green colocalizes with red. That would mean the same cells are both red and green, indicating apoptosis in the iPSC-derived cells.

But wait, why would the iPSCs die so quickly? I thought that iPSCs are pluripotent and can integrate into the embryo, but maybe the process of injection or the environment is causing stress. Alternatively, maybe the host blastocyst is undergoing its own cell divisions and the cells are differentiating, leading to apoptosis in some areas.

Wait, but the question is about the first thing you notice. So perhaps within the first 12 hours, some of the injected cells have died. Or perhaps the TUNEL staining isn't present yet because apoptosis hasn't started yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the red signal is present but the green isn't. Because if the cells are just starting to migrate but not yet undergoing apoptosis, you wouldn't see green. So option C says there's no green signal. But that depends on whether apoptosis is happening in those cells at that time.

Wait, during the initial phases, maybe the cells are just integrating and starting to divide, so apoptosis isn't occurring much. So perhaps the first thing you see is the red signals, which are the iPSCs, but no green. So option C would be the case.

Alternatively, if the process of cell injection into the blastocyst causes some damage or stress, leading to cell death in the injected cells, then the red and green would colocalize. So which is more likely?

I'm not entirely sure, but I remember that when you inject foreign cells into the blastocyst, there can be some immune response or stress, but in mice, I think the embryo's environment is somewhat permissive. However, perhaps in the initial 12 hours, the cells are still alive. So the first observation would be red signals but no green. So option C says there is no green signal. That would be the first thing noticed.

Wait, but the question also says that they are tracking the iPSC fate and their co-localization with apoptotic events. So perhaps the first thing is that when the cells are injected, they haven't started to die, so only red is present. So the first observation would be the red signals without green.

Alternatively, if the cells are dying, then the first thing would be red and green together. But I think in the initial stages, perhaps the cells are just present, not undergoing apoptosis yet. So the first thing you notice is the red signals, and no green. So option C is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options: option C is 'there is no green signal.' So if the cells are not undergoing apoptosis, then green (TUNEL) is not present. So that would make sense as the first observation.

So, based on that, the first thing noticed would be no green signal. So the answer is C.


The experiment involves injecting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) labeled with mRaspberry (a red fluorescent protein under lineage-specific promoters) into a 32-cell blastocyst. The goal is to track the iPSC fate and their co-localization with apoptotic events using TUNEL-FITC staining (green signal for DNA fragmentation) over 48 hours. The question asks what the first observation would be.

Key considerations include the timeline of the experiment and the behavior of the iPSCs and TUNEL staining. At the 32-cell blastocyst stage, the iPSCs are pluripotent and expected to integrate into the inner cell mass (ICM) and potentially differentiate. However, during the initial 12 hours, the iPSCs are likely still alive and not undergoing apoptosis. TUNEL-FITC staining specifically detects apoptotic cells, and if apoptosis has not yet occurred in the injected iPSCs, no green signal would be observed.

Option A suggests that red signals label different organelles, but this is irrelevant to the first observation. Option B implies that red and green signals colocalize, which would require apoptosis in the iPSCs, an event unlikely to occur so early. Option C states there is no green signal, which aligns with the expectation that apoptosis has not yet begun. Option D refers to cytoplasmic localization of the red signal, which is not relevant to the first observation.

Given that the first observation is likely focused on the presence or absence of apoptotic events, and apoptosis is unlikely to occur within the first 12 hours, the most reasonable conclusion is that there is no green signal at this stage.

Answer: C
