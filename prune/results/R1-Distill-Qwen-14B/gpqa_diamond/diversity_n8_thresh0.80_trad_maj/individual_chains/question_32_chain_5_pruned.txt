Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so this must be about calculating the energy required to accelerate a specific nucleus to a certain speed. Let's break it down.

The question says the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. I think nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I need to find the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of this Li-6 nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. So this is a relativistic problem because the speed is a significant fraction of c. Relativistic effects are important here.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times mc squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. So gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). I think that's right.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think each ion is accelerated to a certain energy, so I probably need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c.

So first, let's get the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Since it's made up of protons and neutrons, each with approximately the same mass, the mass of the nucleus should be around 6 times the mass of a proton (since each proton and neutron is about the same mass, and there are 6 in total).

The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So 6 protons would be 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Wait, but that's per nucleus. Oh, but wait, wait—each proton and neutron has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², so six of them would be 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. So the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is 562
