Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided are the IR and 1H NMR spectra of Compound X.

First, let me recall what reactions involve red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! That's the Heyns reaction or maybe some kind of substitution. Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. Alternatively, I think when you have a carbonyl compound like an aldehyde or ketone, reacting with red phosphorus and HI can lead to a substitution. Maybe it's a halogenation reaction, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Wittig reaction, but no, because that usually involves triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus is sometimes used in the formation of ylides, especially in the Wittig reaction. But the other reagent here is HI, which is a strong acid. So maybe this is a situation where the compound has a carbonyl group, and upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the carbonyl is converted into something else. Or perhaps it's a substitution at an adjacent position.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the substitution of certain groups. Oh! I remember now. When you have a nitro group, for example, reacting with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of an amine. But wait, the compound here might not be a nitro compound. Alternatively, for an alkyne, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the carbonyl group. So, if the starting compound has a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with red phosphorus and HI might lead to the formation of an alkyl halide. Oh, right! I think in such a reaction, the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a phosphorus-containing group, and then when HI is added, it might substitute that group with a halide. So, the process might be converting a ketone into a secondary alcohol or perhaps something else.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is part of a benzaldehyde structure. Let me think about the IR and NMR data to figure out the structure of Compound X.

Let's look at the IR data first.

IR peaks given: 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, probably O-H stretch. Then 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches, indicating a benzene ring.

So, in the IR, we see O-H (maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) and a carbonyl group. But wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is broad. The 3400–2500 cm-1 might be a broad O-H, like from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But the presence of a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1 suggests it's a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, but a bit lower. 1720 is more likely a ketone or aldehyde. Hmm.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a strong absorption around 1700 cm-1, and a broad O-H around 2500-3300. So 1720 is a bit higher, which might indicate an ester or maybe an aldehyde. Alternatively, a ketone. But let's think about the NMR data.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which often suggests an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because in alcohols, the O-H is usually a triplet due to coupling with adjacent protons, but if it's a broad peak, it's probably a carboxylic acid.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Downfield protons, likely aromatic. A doublet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Maybe para-substituted aromatic protons.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, perhaps ortho to substituents.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A
