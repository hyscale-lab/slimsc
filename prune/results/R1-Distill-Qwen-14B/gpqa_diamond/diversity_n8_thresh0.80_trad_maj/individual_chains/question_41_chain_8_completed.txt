Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to a lab observer. I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer and in the same direction as the light beam. So if the light is going, say, to the right, and the glass is moving to the right as well, but the observer is in the lab. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Or perhaps the glass is moving towards the observer, which could mean moving in the opposite direction of the light's propagation? Or is the light moving towards the observer because the glass is moving that way?

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, which is moving toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is in the same direction as the beam. Hmm, maybe the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity? Or maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, which is moving towards the observer. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the beam is moving in a certain direction, and the glass is moving in the same direction towards the observer. Wait, that seems a bit conflicting, because if the beam is moving towards the observer, then the glass would need to be moving in the same direction as the beam towards the observer. Maybe I should visualize it.

Imagine the lab frame as the observer's frame. The glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v, but the light beam is moving in the same direction. Wait, perhaps the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, but in the same direction as the beam. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer. I'm getting a bit stuck on the directions, but perhaps it's not crucial for the speed calculation.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's the speed within the medium when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But what if the medium itself is moving?

Ah, right! This is about the effect of the medium's motion on the observed speed of light. I remember something about the Doppler effect for light, but that's usually about frequency and wavelength changes. But in this case, we're asked about the speed, which is a vector quantity.

Wait, let me think about reference frames. If the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, then the light's velocity in the lab frame would depend on both the light's velocity within the glass and the glass's motion.

So, the light's speed in the glass is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be the vector sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass.

Wait, but I need to be careful with vector addition here. Let's consider the direction. Suppose the glass is moving towards the observer (so in the positive x-direction, say towards the observer). The light within the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So their velocities would add.

Wait, no. Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, which is moving at velocity v. So if the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, then the light's speed in the lab frame would be the speed of the light in the glass plus the glass's velocity, but only if they're in the same direction. But can you just add velocities that way? Wait, but that's only valid for low speeds. For high speeds, we should use relativistic velocity addition. But since the problem gives c=1, perhaps it's considering relativistic effects. Wait, but the problem says to take c=1. So perhaps we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Hmm, but if we're assuming non-relativistic speeds, then the velocities would add linearly. But given that the problem mentions a glass moving at velocity v, perhaps v is much less than c, so we can treat it as non-relativistic. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at velocity v_light = c/n, right? Because in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, what is the light's speed?

In Newtonian mechanics, velocities add linearly. So if the glass is moving at v and the light is moving at (c/n) in the same direction as v, then the lab would see the light moving at v_light = v + (c/n). But wait, no, that can't be right because if v is in the same direction as the light, then yes, you add them. But wait, that would be okay only if v is much smaller than c, but the index of refraction n is greater than 1, so c/n is less than c, but v is given as a velocity, perhaps a significant fraction of c? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe we have to consider the relativistic case.

Wait, but the options given don't involve any square roots or other relativistic terms, so maybe it's a non-relativistic treatment. Let me check the options.

Option B is 1, which can't be correct because the glass is moving, so the speed of light in the lab should be different from c. Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), and option C is (1 + n v)/(n - v), and option D is (1 -n v)/(n +v).

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light's velocity in the glass is u', then in the lab frame, the velocity u is given by (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Since c=1, it's (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

But in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u' = c/n. So substituting, u = (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/n) v).

But since c=1, u = (1/n + v)/(1 + v/(n)).

Let me compute that. Let me factor 1/n in numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1 + n v)/n.

Denominator: (n + v)/n.

So when we divide numerator by denominator, the n's cancel, giving (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the direction matters. In the scenario, the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So both u' and v are in the same direction. So their sum would be positive.

So in that case, the velocity u is ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ).

Wait, but when I compute that, it's [ (1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option A. So that's the speed of light in the lab frame.

But wait, I'm making an assumption here about the direction. The problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. If the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, that suggests that the light is moving toward the observer as well. So the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction. So in the lab frame, both are moving in the same direction, so their velocities add.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps the light is moving in the opposite direction relative to the glass's movement. Hmm, but the problem says the beam is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's movement. So, for example, if the glass is moving to the right, the light is moving to the right in the glass. So from the lab's frame, the light's velocity is the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass.

So using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ), but since c=1, it's (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

Substituting u' = c/n = 1/n, so:

( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

(1 + n v) / (n + v).

So that's option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, that would mean the light is moving towards the observer, right? So if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then from the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer faster than c/n.

Wait, but another thing to think about: when the medium is moving, does the speed of light in that medium change as observed in another frame? Because in the glass's rest frame, light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, the lab frame sees the light's speed as per the velocity addition formula.

So the correct calculation should be using the relativistic velocity addition, which gives option A as the answer.

So looking back at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which matches our result.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam propagates through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \). Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \). Using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed of light in the lab frame is given by:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the given setup. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory observer is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
