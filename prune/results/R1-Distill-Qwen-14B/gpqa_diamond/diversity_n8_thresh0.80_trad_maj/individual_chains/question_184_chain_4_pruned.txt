Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can get tricky. Let me take a deep breath and start breaking it down.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence will give me the desired product with high yield.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering matters. Let me think about the substituent positions.

Wait, 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So if I number the ring such that the ethoxy is at position 1, then the tert-butyl is at position 2, and the nitro is at position 3. So the substituents are adjacent to each other in a meta arrangement?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The positions are 1, 2, 3. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So the benzene ring has substituents every other carbon, making a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But wait, that's not possible because with three substituents, they can't all be on adjacent positions without some being meta or para. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, the target compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, on a benzene ring, these are in the 1,2,3 positions. So the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl is at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So they're all adjacent. Hmm, but that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Interesting. So the substituents are in the ortho, meta, and para positions relative to each other.

Wait, another way: ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (so adjacent to ethoxy), nitro at 3 (adjacent to tert-butyl and across from ethoxy). So the substituents are in a sort of meta arrangement, but adjacent to each other.

But wait, how can that be? Because each substituent is in a specific position relative to the others.

To synthesize this, I need to perform a series of substitution reactions on benzene. The order of introducing substituents is crucial because each substitution affects the positions where the next substituent can go, especially considering directing effects of the groups.

So, benzene is the starting material. Let's think about the substituents:

- tert-butyl group: This is a bulky substituent, probably introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts is typically for alkylating aromatic rings, but bulky groups like tert-butyl can be tricky because the carbocation might not form easily or might undergo hydride shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl is introduced through another method, maybe via a directing group.

Wait, but the first step in all options is introducing the tert-butyl. Let me check the options again.

Option A starts with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Similarly, option B and C start with the same. Option D starts with nitration.

So, first reaction in options A, B, C is Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. Option D starts with nitration.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts alkylation can be problematic with bulky groups because the carbocation might not be stable or could rearrange. tert-Butyl chloride would generate a t-butyl carbocation, which is stable. So it should work. So introducing the t-butyl group first.

But wait, after introducing the first substituent, the next substituents' positions will be influenced by the directing effect of the first group.

So, after t-butyl is attached (as a strong activating group, ortho/para director), the next substituent will be directed by this group.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are at 1,2,3. So after the first substituent, the next should go into a certain position.

Wait, maybe the order of introducing substituents is important. Let me think about each substituent's directing effect.

Ethoxy group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. Nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta director.

So, the order of substituent introduction is key. Let's plan.

The target has
