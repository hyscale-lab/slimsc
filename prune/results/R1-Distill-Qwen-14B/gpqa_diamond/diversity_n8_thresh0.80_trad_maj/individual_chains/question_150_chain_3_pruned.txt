Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to find the final product from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but an aldehyde is usually a singlet because it's only one proton. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Could it be an aromatic proton in a specific environment?

Wait, wait. Another thought: sometimes aldehyde protons can be split if there's coupling, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a phenol, but phenols are usually around 5-7 ppm. Oh, but in some cases, like if it's an enol or something, maybe it's higher. Or perhaps it's a ketone? No, ketones don't have protons. Maybe an aldehyde is more likely here.

The next peak is 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Then 6.51 ppm, another doublet (d), 2H. That looks like a pair of doublets, which are typically indicative of a para-substituted aromatic ring. So perhaps a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. The two doublets might be the two sets of protons on either side of the substituents. Like, for example, if there's an electron-withdrawing group in the para position, the protons would be deshielded and show up around 6.98, and the adjacent ones at 6.51. So maybe a nitro group or an -O- group? Wait, but the molecular formula has an N and an O. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation calculation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C
