Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Okay, let's start by recalling what parallax means. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, plx (in arcseconds) is about 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. Right, because the formula is plx = 1/distance (d), so d = 1/plx.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, we're looking at how the density of stars changes as a function of parallax. If stars are uniformly distributed, it means that the actual number density in space is uniform. Wait, but when we observe them, how does that translate into parallax space?

Let me think about the distribution in terms of distance. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density n is constant with distance. So, n(r) = constant. But when we observe them, we're projecting along the line of sight, and the number we observe in a certain range depends on how much volume is there at that distance.

Wait, so the number of stars we observe with parallax between plx and plx + dplx would depend on the volume of space at that parallax. Because plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx. Let's think in terms of distance. The volume element between distance d and d + dd is a cylindrical volume, right? Because as you look out, the volume is based on a shell with radius d and thickness dd. The volume of a thin shell is approximately 2π d² * dd multiplied by the solid angle (but wait, wait, maybe we can ignore solid angle for this problem? Hmm, perhaps the question is considering all directions, so solid angle is uniform, or maybe it's looking at a differential in the radial direction.)

Wait, but parallax is a function of distance. So, for a given parallax plx, the distance d is 1/plx. So, if we have a small change in parallax dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance dd?

Let me compute that. Since d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. Taking derivatives, d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. So, dplx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = -d² dplx. But since we're considering the magnitude, maybe we can ignore the negative sign, so the change in distance is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * dplx
