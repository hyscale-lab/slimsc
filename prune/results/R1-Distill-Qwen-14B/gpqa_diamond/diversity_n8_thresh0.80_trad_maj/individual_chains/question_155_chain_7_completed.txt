Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup is about an operator P which has components Px, Py, and Pz. The matrices for each of these operators are given in a specific basis, which are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the basis vectors are |+z> and |-z>, I think. Wait, no, wait. Since it's a three-dimensional system, maybe the basis is the eigenstates of Pz, which would have three possible eigenvalues. Hmm, but looking at the matrix for Pz, it's a 3x3 matrix with diagonal entries hbar, 0, -hbar. So the eigenvalues are +hbar, 0, and -hbar. Hmm, so the basis vectors are |1> = [1,0,0], |2> = [0,1,0], and |3> = [0,0,1], but these are the eigenstates of Pz.

The system is found in the eigenstate of Px corresponding to the eigenvalue -hbar. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So that's the state vector ψ in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors.

The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz, which is the standard deviation of the Pz operator when the system is in this state ψ.

I remember that the uncertainty is calculated as the square root of the expectation of Pz squared minus the square of the expectation of Pz. So ΔPz = sqrt( <Pz²> - <Pz>² ).

But wait, in this case, since Pz is an operator, and the state is given, I need to compute these expectation values.

Let me write down the steps I need to take:

1. Compute the expectation value <Pz> = ψ† Pz ψ
2. Compute the expectation value <Pz²> = ψ† (Pz^2) ψ
3. Then calculate ΔPz = sqrt(<Pz²> - (<Pz>)^2)

First, I need to figure out what Pz is. The matrix is given as:

Pz = [[hbar, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, -hbar]]

So that's a diagonal matrix with elements hbar, 0, -hbar on the diagonal.

The state vector ψ is given as a column vector:
ψ = [ -1/2,
        1/sqrt(2),
        -1/2 ]

Wait, wait, are the components in the same order as the basis vectors? So the first component is the amplitude for the |+z> state (eigenvalue hbar), the second for the middle eigenstate (eigenvalue 0), and the third for |-z> (eigenvalue -hbar).

But wait, let me make sure. The basis is the eigenvectors of Pz, so each basis vector |i> corresponds to Pz |i> = p_i |i>, where p_i are the diagonal elements of Pz's matrix.

So for our purposes, ψ is a vector in this basis, so when I compute the expectation values, I can just work with the matrix representation.

Let me compute <Pz> first. Since ψ is a column vector, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose (bra) ψ† multiplied by Pz, then multiplied by ψ (the ket).

But wait, the components of ψ are real numbers, right? Let's check: the given vector has elements -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2. So all real. So the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.

So ψ† is a row vector: [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]

So <Pz> = ψ† * Pz * ψ.

Let me compute each term.

Wait, another approach: since Pz is diagonal, each component in the state contributes to the expectation value. Specifically, <Pz> is the sum over i |ψ_i|^2 * p_i, where ψ_i are the components of the state vector.

Because Pz is diagonal, it's an eigenvalue operator, so the expectation value can be calculated as summing the squared magnitudes of each component multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So let's compute this.

The components of ψ are:

ψ₁ = -1/2 → |ψ₁|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4
ψ₂ = 1/sqrt(2) → |ψ₂|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
ψ₃ = -1/2 → |ψ₃|² = 1/4

The eigenvalues are p₁ = hbar, p₂ = 0, p₃ = -hbar.

So <Pz> = (1/4)(hbar) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-hbar)
= (hbar/4) + 0 + (-hbar/4)
= 0

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation of Pz is zero.

Now, what about <Pz^2>? That would be the sum of |ψ_i|² multiplied by (p_i)^2.

So the eigenvalues squared are (hbar)^2, 0, (-hbar)^2 = hbar².

So <Pz²> = (1/4)(hbar²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(hbar²)
= (hbar²/4) + 0 + (hbar²/4)
= (2 hbar²/4) = hbar² / 2

So now the variance is <Pz²> - (<Pz>)^2 = (hbar²/2) - (0)^2 = hbar² / 2.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔPz is sqrt( hbar² / 2 ) = hbar / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is hbar/sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I do the calculations correctly?

The state vector is [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. Its squared norms are (1/4, 1/2, 1/4). So yeah, each component contributes as I said.

So <Pz> is zero. <Pz²> is (1/4 + 1/4) hbar² times 1 (since p_i² is hbar² for first and third, and 0 for the second). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the third component is -hbar, so its square is hbar². So the sum is 1/4 hbar² (from first term) + 0 (second) + 1/4 hbar² (third) = 1/2 hbar².

So variance is 1/2 hbar², so square root is hbar / sqrt(2). So the uncertainty is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the given basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The state vector is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 p_i,
\]

where $|\psi_i|^2$ are the squared magnitudes of the components of $\psi$, and $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|\psi_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |\psi_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |\psi_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting the eigenvalues $p_1 = \hbar$, $p_2 = 0$, and $p_3 = -\hbar$, we get:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, i.e., $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Using the same formula for $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |\psi_i|^2 p_i^2.
\]

Substituting the squared eigenvalues $p_1^2 = \hbar^2$, $p_2^2 = 0$, and $p_3^2 = \hbar^2$, we get:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
