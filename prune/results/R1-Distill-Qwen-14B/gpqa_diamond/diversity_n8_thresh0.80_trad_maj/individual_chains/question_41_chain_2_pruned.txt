Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. They're asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer. Oh, and c is 1, so the speed of light in a vacuum is 1.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light propagates, but how exactly? I think this has to do with the Doppler effect, but no, wait, the Doppler effect deals with frequency and wavelength changes, not the speed. Or maybe it's about the refractive index and motion affecting the speed.

Wait, Newtonian physics says that velocities add linearly. But wait, when dealing with light, which is electromagnetic, things are different because of relativity, but wait, this is a classical physics problem, probably. So perhaps we can use the classical approach here.

In a stationary medium, the speed of light inside the glass is c/n = 1/n. But now the glass is moving. How does that affect the observed speed?

So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light is moving at 1/n in the glass's frame, but the glass is moving at v relative to the lab.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the speed of light would be the speed in the medium plus the medium's velocity? Or is that not correct.

Wait, no, I think it's more complicated. Because in different frames, the speed of light isn't just additive. In special relativity, the speed of light is always c, but this problem says to take c as 1, but what about in the medium?

Wait, but the problem says "speed of light in glass relative to the observer." So the glass is moving, but we're to find how fast the light is moving in the lab frame.

Hmm, perhaps using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because if the glass is moving, and the light is in the glass, then
