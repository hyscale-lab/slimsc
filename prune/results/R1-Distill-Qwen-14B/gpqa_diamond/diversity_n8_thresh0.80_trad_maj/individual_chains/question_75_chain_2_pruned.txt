Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question. Let's read through the problem carefully. 

The setup is about creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. The researcher introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The question is why they couldn't overexpress the protein. The possible options are A to D.

Looking at the given DNA sequence of the plus strand, I need to figure out what's wrong. Let's think about how gene constructs are made. The coding sequence (CDS) is usually in the same direction as the promoter, so the mRNA will be made from the template strand. The start codon is at the beginning, followed by the coding sequence.

The construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA sequence should be at the beginning of the coding region. Let me look for the start codon, which is ATG.

Looking at the beginning of the given sequence: 5'ATG TAC... So the first codon is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the HA tag is a specific sequence. I think the HA tag is a small peptide, usually around 11 amino acids. The HA tag's coding sequence is something like ATG CAG CAG ... etc. So the first part after ATG should code for HA.

Wait, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TAC G... Let's translate that to amino acids. Let's see:

ATG is Methionine (start).
TAC is Tyrosine.
CCA is Proline.
TAC is Tyrosine.
GAT is Aspartic acid.
GTT is Valine.
TCC is Serine.
AGA is Arginine.
TAC is Tyrosine.
GCT is Alanine.
GCA is Ala? Wait, each codon is three letters.

Wait, the sequence is: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TAC G...

So:

ATG: Met
TAC: Tyr
CCA: Pro
TAC: Tyr
GAT: Asp
GTT: Val
TCC: Ser
AGA: Arg
TAC: Tyr
GCT: Ala
GCA: Ala
... and so on.

Hmm, the HA tag is usually a specific sequence. For example, the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. Which translates to the DNA sequence: TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TAC GCT GCA GCT G... Wait, that's exactly what I'm seeing here.

Wait, the HA tag is being added at the N-terminus, so the first part of the coding sequence should be the HA tag. So the initial part of the given sequence is the HA tag. So the HA is correctly inserted.

But let me check the very beginning. The first codon is ATG, which is correct for initiating translation. Then the next codons make up the HA tag. So the HA is correctly placed, no issue there.

But why can't they overexpress the protein? Let's look at the possible options.

Option A: Missense mutation in the HA sequence. So the HA's DNA has a mutation leading to wrong amino acids. Let's see if the sequence after ATG matches the HA.

The HA's DNA sequence is ATG CAG CAG ... wait, no. Let's verify. The HA tag in DNA is typically the coding sequence for YPYDVPDYD. Let me write the amino acids and their codons.

YPYDVPDYD:
Y is TAC,
P is CCA or CCA,
Y is TAC,
D is GAT,
V is GTT,
P is CCA,
D is GAT,
Y is TAC,
D is GAT.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact HA tag sequence. The HA tag is often derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein, and the common tag used is amino acids YPYDVPDYD. So the DNA sequence for that would be:

Y: TAC,
P: CCA,
Y: TAC,
D: GAT,
V: GTT,
P: CCA,
D: GAT,
Y: TAC,
D: GAT.

So putting that together, the DNA sequence would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GAT. Wait, but in the given construct, the first part after ATG is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TAC GCT GCA GCT ... Hmm.

Wait, in the given sequence, after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), TCC (S), AGA (R), TAC (Y), etc. So the HA sequence in the construct is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TAC GCT GCA G... But wait, that doesn't make sense for the HA tag because the HA's next codon after GTT (V) should be CCA (P), but here it's TCC (Serine) instead. So in the given construct, after GTT (Val), it's TCC which is Serine, not CCA (Pro). So that would change the amino acid. So that would be a missense mutation in the HA tag. So the HA sequence is incorrect, which would lead to a different protein, possibly not recognized by antibodies, but does that prevent overexpression? Hmm.

Wait, but the question is about overexpression. If the HA is wrong, maybe the purification using HA antibody won't work, but the construct is expressed. So why can't they overexpress? Maybe the HA is not the issue here.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a stop codon introduced. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons in the sequence.

Looking through the codons, let's scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

The sequence is:

5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

Hmm, let's look for any of the stop codons.

The construct starts with ATG and continues. Let's go through the codons:

ATG - Met
TAC - Tyr
CCA - Pro
TAC - Tyr
GAT - Asp
GTT - Val
TCC - Ser
AGA - Arg
TAC - Tyr
GCT - Ala
GCA - Ala
GCT - Ala
GTC - Val
GGC - Gly
GAC - Asp
ACAGG... Hmm, perhaps I should look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Wait, let me look for the presence of these. The sequence is long, but let's look through.

Looking for TAA: Let's see if any triplet in the sequence is TAA.

Looking through, do I see TAA? Let me see:

Looking at the first part: ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm. Let's look for TAA:

Looking for T followed by A followed by A. Let me scan through:

- ... CTTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Ah, in the middle, I see 'TGA' at the end: ...TGA. Let me check the exact spot. Oh, wait, at the very end, it's ...CGAGTGA3'. So the last codon is TGA.

So the sequence ends with ...TGA. That's a stop codon. So the gene construct has a TGA at the end, which would terminate translation early. So the stop codon is present right at the end. Does that mean the coding sequence is correctly terminated?

Wait, the construct should have a stop codon after the GADD45G coding sequence. But in this case, the sequence ends with TGA, so the translation would stop there. But why is that a problem?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The construct is designed to have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. So the last codon of the GADD45G coding sequence should be followed by a stop codon.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the very last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the entire construct is from ATG to TGA. That would make sense because the coding sequence would include the HA tag, then the GADD45G, and end with a stop codon. So the presence of TGA at the end is correct.

Wait, but let me check if there's any other stop codon before that. Let's see if any triplet in the sequence is TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the sequence, I see:

- ... TAC GAG TCA GTA C... Hmm, not a stop.

Wait, in the middle, I
