Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, like dehydrohalogenation, to form an alkene. But wait, wait—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the reaction is a bit different. Oh, right, adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so the elimination would form an alkene within that structure.

So the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, product 1. The NMR spectrum shows peaks: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but elimination would form an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Could it be a substitution reaction instead?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the initial reaction is a double displacement. Since 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines, and KOH is in excess, maybe both bromides are replaced by hydroxide ions. So that would form 1,3-dihydroxyl adamantane. But then, if there's an IR peak at 1720, that's a strong carbonyl. So maybe that's not it. Wait, another thought—maybe the initial reaction is a dehydration to form an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide formation usually involves peracids, not KOH. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether. But how? Wait, wait—if KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide via a different mechanism. Or maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? No, I don't think so. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the IR. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. That suggests a ketone or ester. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement? Pinacol
