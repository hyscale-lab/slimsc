Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. When heated with excess KOH, it probably undergoes some elimination reaction. KOH is a strong base, so dehydrohalogenation maybe? But wait, dibromide... so would it form an alkene?

So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH (excess) should give an elimination product. The product is a light yellow solid, which suggests maybe an alkene, because alkenes can have such colors sometimes. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Hmm, wait, that's conflicting. Because if it's an elimination, I would expect an alkene, which would show up in IR around 1650 cm^-1 for C=C. But here it's 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester. So maybe I was wrong about elimination.

Wait, KOH can also induce substitution. But substitution of two bromines with hydroxide? That would give 1,3-diol adamantane. But diols usually don't have strong carbonyl peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann condensation? No, that's for cyclic esters. Wait, but with KOH, perhaps elimination to form a ketone? That doesn't make sense because eliminating two bromides would leave a carbonyl group.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane under strong base like KOH in a high temperature would undergo dehydrohalogenation, but that would form an alkene. However, the IR here shows a carbonyl. So perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution leading to a ketone? Wait, but how would that happen? Another possibility is that the compound is undergoing a double elimination, forming an epoxide? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe
