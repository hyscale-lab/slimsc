Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) plus a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV and mu is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D with different pairs of energies.

Alright, so I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Since Pi is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the products must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Wait, but the neutrino is involved here. I think neutrinos are hard to detect because they have such tiny mass, but in this case, maybe we can consider it massless? Or does it have a rest mass I should account for? Oh wait, the problem doesn't give the neutrino's mass, so I guess we can treat it as massless. That should make the calculations easier.

So, the decay is at rest, so initially, the momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum (since for massless particles, E = pc). The muon, on the other hand, has both energy and rest mass.

Let me write down the conservation of energy and momentum equations. 

Energy conservation:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum conservation:
p_pi (which is zero) = p_mu + p_nu

Since Pi is at rest, its energy is just its rest mass energy: E_pi = m_pi * c^2. But in units where c=1, this is just 139.6 MeV.

So, E_pi = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c^2 + K_mu. Similarly, E_nu is just the neutrino's kinetic energy because it's massless, so E_nu = K_nu.

Wait, but wait! The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so E_nu = p_nu * c. But since we're working in units where c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

So from momentum conservation, since p_mu = -p_nu, their magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

So, p_mu = p, p_nu = p.

Now, let's write the energy equation again:

139.6 MeV = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + E_nu

But E_nu is p, because E = pc for the neutrino. So,

139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + p

Wait, but I also know that for the muon, the energy is related to its momentum via the relativistic energy-momentum relation. That is, E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Again, with c=1,

E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2

So,

(105.7 + K_mu)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2

Expanding the left side:

(105.7)^2 + 2*105.7*K_mu + (K_mu)^2 = p^2 + (105.7)^2

Subtract (105.7)^2 from both sides:

2*105.7*K_mu + (K_mu)^2 = p^2

So,

p^2 = 211.4 * K_mu + (K_mu)^2

Now, going back to the energy equation:

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + p

Let me rearrange that:

p = 139.6 - 105.7 - K_mu

p = 33.9 - K_mu

So, p = 33.9 - K_mu

But p^2 is equal to 211.4 K_mu + (K_mu)^2.

So substituting p from the above into this equation:

(33.9 - K_mu)^2 = 211.4 K_mu + (K_mu)^2

Expanding the left side:

(33.9)^2 - 2*33.9*K_mu + (K_mu)^2 = 211.4 K_mu + (K_mu)^2

Subtract (K_mu)^2 from both sides:

1149.21 - 67.8 K_mu = 211.4 K_mu

Bring all terms to one side:

1149.21 = 211.4 K_mu + 67.8 K_mu

1149.21 = 279.2 K_mu

So,

K_mu = 1149.21 / 279.2 ≈ 4.12 MeV

Wait, that's approximately 4.12 MeV. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 33.9 squared is 33.9 * 33.9. Let me compute that.

33 * 33 is 1089, 33*0.9 is 29.7, 0.9*33 is 29.7, and 0.9^2 is 0.81. So,

(33 + 0.9)^2 = 33^2 + 2*33*0.9 + 0.9^2 = 1089 + 59.4 + 0.81 = 1149.21. Yes, that's correct.

So 1149.21 = 279.2 * K_mu → K_mu ≈ 1149.21 / 279.2.

Wait, let me compute that. 279.2 * 4 = 1116.8. 1149.21 - 1116.8 is 32.41. 32.41 / 279.2 ≈ 0.116. So 4.116, which is about 4.12 MeV. So K_mu is approximately 4.12 MeV.

Okay, so the muon's kinetic energy is about 4.12 MeV.

Now, what about the neutrino's energy? From earlier, p = 33.9 - K_mu = 33.9 -4.12 = 29.78 MeV.

But p is the same as E_nu since E=pc for the neutrino. So E_nu is 29.78 MeV. That's the neutrino's kinetic energy because it's massless. So the neutrino has kinetic energy of approximately 29.78 MeV.

So, looking at the options, the Muon has KE ~4.12 MeV, neutrino ~29.8 MeV. So the option D says 4.12 and 29.8. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, another approach: the total energy available is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest mass is 105.7, so the maximum possible kinetic energy the muon can have is 139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. But in reality, some energy goes to the neutrino.

So the muon's KE must be less than 33.9 MeV. In our calculation, we found 4.12 MeV for the muon. The neutrino takes the rest, which is about 33.9 -4.12=29.78, which matches our earlier calculation.

Yes, so the answer should be option D: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.


To determine the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \text{ (at rest)} \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

we use conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \). The neutrino is treated as massless (\( m_\nu = 0 \)).

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After the decay, the total energy is shared between the muon and the neutrino:
\[
E_{\pi^+} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu,
\]
where \( E_{\mu^+} = m_{\mu^+} c^2 + K_{\mu^+} \) (total energy of the muon, including its rest energy and kinetic energy) and \( E_\nu = K_\nu \) (kinetic energy of the neutrino, since it is massless).

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
\vec{p}_{\mu^+} + \vec{p}_\nu = 0 \implies |\vec{p}_{\mu^+}| = |\vec{p}_\nu| = p.
\]

For the muon, the relativistic energy-momentum relation is:
\[
E_{\mu^+}^2 = p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2.
\]

### Solving for \( K_{\mu^+} \) and \( K_\nu \)
From the energy conservation equation:
\[
139.6 = (105.7 + K_{\mu^+}) + p.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
p = 33.9 - K_{\mu^+}.
\]

Substitute \( p \) into the energy-momentum relation:
\[
(105.7 + K_{\mu^+})^2 = (33.9 - K_{\mu^+})^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
(105.7)^2 + 2(105.7)K_{\mu^+} + (K_{\mu^+})^2 = (33.9)^2 - 2(33.9)K_{\mu^+} + (K_{\mu^+})^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]

Canceling terms:
\[
2(105.7)K_{\mu^+} = (33.9)^2 - 2(33.9)K_{\mu^+}.
\]

Rearranging:
\[
2(105.7)K_{\mu^+} + 2(33.9)K_{\mu^+} = (33.9)^2.
\]

\[
K_{\mu^+} [2(105.7) + 2(33.9)] = (33.9)^2.
\]

\[
K_{\mu^+} = \frac{(33.9)^2}{2(105.7 + 33.9)}.
\]

\[
K_{\mu^+} = \frac{1149.21}{279.2} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The neutrino's kinetic energy is:
\[
K_\nu = p = 33.9 - K_{\mu^+} = 33.9 - 4.12 = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The muon's kinetic energy is approximately \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \), and the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately \( 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**
