Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is like breaking and reforming double bonds, right? Oh wait, Grubbs is specifically for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. So when Grubbs is involved, the double bonds in the molecule can rearrange.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers, but since Grubbs is a chiral catalyst? Or wait, no, Grubbs catalyst itself is a chiral catalyst for asymmetric metathesis, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, the question is about the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So maybe the stereochemistry doesn't matter as much as the structure.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene structure... Let me draw that. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. But 3-methyl would be on the third carbon, so it's CH₂=CHCH(CH₃)₂? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon, so it's CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait the structure. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's number the chain. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 carbons. The double bond is between 1 and 2 (pent-1-ene). So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would be a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's 3-methylpent-1-ene.

But wait, the molecule is racemic, which implies it has a chiral center. So let's look at the structure after the double bond. The molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no. Let me count again. 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)₂? No, wait. Pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene: positions 1-2 double bond. So positions 1 (CH₂), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH-), etc. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would make the third carbon connected to a methyl group (CH(CH3)), and then two more carbons. So is that correct?

Wait, but when I'm looking at the structure, the molecule is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3?

Wait, but that's six carbons. No, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons. So 1 and 2 are double bonded. So C1: CH₂=, C2: CH-, C3: CH(CH3)-, then C4: CH2-, C5: CH3? Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me draw it:

Carbon chain:
1: CH₂=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)-
4: CH2-
5: CH3

Wait, but that makes the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Oh wait, but that's six carbons because after the double bond, the chain continues. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me count it again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: So the pent indicates five carbons in the main chain, and a methyl group on carbon 3.

So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in the
