Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Wait, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration of H+ ions decreases, which makes the pH increase. So the initial pH should be higher than if you didn't dilute it. But before that, let's break down the steps.

So the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will be half, right? Because concentration is moles over volume, and the volume doubles. So new concentration is 0.025 M. Wait, no: wait, 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = 1 mmol (since 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol = 1 mmol). Adding 20 cm³ of water makes it 40 cm³, so 1 mmol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yes, that's correct.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. 

At 25% titration. Oh wait, 25% of what? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So, let's calculate that first.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So equivalence point is when 0.001 mol of NaOH is added. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question isn't about the equivalence point yet. It's about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. Let me calculate moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, this means that 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is converted to acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

Initially, we have 0.001 mol of acetic acid. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume now is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). 

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.405e4) ≈ 4.732 (since log(5.405)=0.732, so 4.732).

So pH = 4.732 + log(0.005882/0.017647) 

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈4.732 -0.477 ≈4.255.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute the ratio exactly.

0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So exactly 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3, log(1/3)= -0.4771.

So pH is pKa -0.4771. pKa is 4.732, so 4.732-0.4771=4.255.

So around 4.26. So for 25% titration, the pH is about 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

So, the concentration of acetate ions is (moles of acetate) / total volume.

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. Total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³ (equivalence point) → 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

So the Kb is 5.405e-10. The concentration is 0.02 M.

Using the approximation for weak bases: [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(Kb * C)

So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 -4.98=9.02.

Wait, but the options don't have 9.02 as an option. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it.

Kb = 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approximately 5.4054e-10.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb = 5.40
