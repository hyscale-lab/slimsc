Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, but what does that mean exactly? Oh right, uniform distribution would mean that the number density of stars is the same everywhere. So there's no clustering; stars are spread out evenly in space.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. Remember, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away. Like, plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d = 1/plx.

Now, I need to find the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So for a given range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there? Let's think in terms of volume.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of the spherical shell at a certain distance. Oh right, because at a certain distance, the volume element is a spherical shell. The volume of a shell between radius r and r + dr is 4π r² dr.

But wait, in terms of parallax, how does that translate? Because plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So if plx is small, d is large—so the star is far away.

So let's define r as the distance. r is 1/plx. So dr, the change in distance, is the derivative of 1/plx with respect to plx. Let me compute that: dr/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. Oh, so dr = -dplx/(plx^2). But I'm dealing with small changes, so I can take the magnitude. So dr = dplx / (plx^2).

Wait, but the volume of the shell is proportional to r² dr. Substituting r in terms of plx: r = 1/plx. So r squared is 1/(plx)^2. And dr is dplx/(plx^2). So the volume element becomes 4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

Wait, wait. Let me re-do that step. The volume element dV is 4π r² dr. So substituting r = 1/plx, dr = dplx * (-1/plx²) (but since we're taking a small positive change, we can ignore the sign). So dr = dplx / plx².

So dV = 4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π
