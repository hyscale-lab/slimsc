Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer in the lab. And the question is about the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, what do I remember about how light speed works in moving media? Oh right, in a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But when the medium itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the speed of light in the medium is always c/n regardless of the medium's motion, right? Because the refractive index already accounts for the medium's properties. So if the glass is moving, but the light's speed through the glass is still c divided by n. But wait, maybe that's not considering the relative motion between the medium and the observer.

Hmm, here's where I might get confused. Let me think about frames of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass. So to an observer on the lab, what speed do they measure the light to be moving?

Wait, I think this is a case of velocity addition. Like, if the medium is moving at v, and the light is moving at v_light relative to the medium, then the lab frame would see the light's speed as v_light + v if they're moving in the same direction. But wait, that's the Galilean addition, which is only
