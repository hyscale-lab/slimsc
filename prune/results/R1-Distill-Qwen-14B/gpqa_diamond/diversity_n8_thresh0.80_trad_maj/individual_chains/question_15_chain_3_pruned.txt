Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet 1 and Planet 2. They have limited time and want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both are already detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet 1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet 2's. Both orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet 1's star is twice as massive as Planet 2's. Wait, but how does that affect the transit probability?

Hmm. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star. Also, the orbital distance must be such that the planet's path is in front of the star from our point of view. Oh right, the transit probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But since we detect via RV, which tells us the minimum mass, I think that the RV method gives us an inclination, but not necessarily edge-on. However, for transit probability, it depends on the alignment.

Wait, but the RV method tells us the mass function, which depends on sin(i), where i is the inclination. So if we have a planet with a higher inclination (closer to 90 degrees), the RV method can measure a higher mass. Since both are detected via RV, maybe their sin(i) is known, but in this question, I think they're asking about the geometric probability, which is independent of what RV tells us. The question says they know the minimum masses because of RV, but for transit probability, it's more about the alignment.

Wait, no. Wait, the geometric probability of a transit is given by R_star / a, where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. So the probability is higher when a is smaller and R is larger. But wait, is that correct? Let me think more.

Another thought: the formula for the probability P that a planet transits is approximately (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor involving the orbital period and maybe the star's mass. Or is it just R_star / a? I'm a bit confused.
