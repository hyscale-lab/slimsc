Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, not too bad, but I'm a bit rusty on relativity equations. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options give different relative speeds and energies, so I need to calculate both the relative velocity and the total energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. There's this formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh right, the formula is (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1*v2)/c²), but wait, in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would actually be the difference between their speeds divided by (1 + (v1*v2)/(c²)). Or wait, maybe I got that mixed up. Let me think. Oh, no, relative velocity in the same direction is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Because if one is moving faster than the other, the relative speed is the difference, but adjusted by the Lorentz factor.

Wait, no, let's get this straight. Suppose astronaut A is moving at v1 relative to an inertial frame, and astronaut B is moving at v2 relative to the same frame. But if A is in a different frame, what is B's speed in A's frame? Oh, right, the formula is (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v1 * v2)/c²). So in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, to find astronaut B's speed relative to astronaut A, we subtract v1 from v2 and adjust by the denominator.

Wait, but which one is the frame moving? Let me define the situation. Let's say astronaut 1 has mass 2m and is moving at 0.6c. Astronaut 2 is 3m moving at 0.5c. So from the perspective of astronaut 1, what's the speed of astronaut 2? Since both are moving in the same direction, astronaut 2 is actually moving slower, so the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, but that gives a negative relative speed, which doesn't make sense. Oh, right, because astronaut 2 is moving slower than astronaut 1 in the same direction, so from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2 is moving backward? No, wait, no. Both are moving forward. Hmm, maybe I should think of the frame where one is stationary and the other is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative speed correctly. Let me restate: astronaut A (2m) is moving at v_A = 0.6c, astronaut B (3m) at v_B = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, B is moving at v = (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/c²). Wait, that would give a negative speed, which would mean B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A. But that can't be
