Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the answer step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration gives the number of protons. So 6H and 4H. The triplet and quartet suggest some splitting due to neighboring protons.

Wait, a triplet (which is splitting into three peaks) and a quartet (four peaks). Maybe this is from a structure where two sets of equivalent protons are next to each other. Like, maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Because if you have a CH2CH2 group, each would split the other. So for a triplet, maybe it's a (CH2)2 group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, or perhaps it's a di-substituted something else.

Wait, 6H as a triplet. Maybe three equivalent CH2 groups, but no, that might not make sense. Oh, wait, 6H could be two sets of three equivalent protons each. Or maybe it's a geminal di-substitution, but that's usually a singlet.

Wait, 0.9 ppm is usually around where methyl groups attached to something, like maybe adjacent to an oxygen or a carbon chain. Let me think about common structures. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H makes me think of two methyl groups each with three H, perhaps attached to adjacent carbons. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H could be a set of four equivalent protons, maybe another CH2 group.

Wait, another possibility is that this is from a diethyl group. Because diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups. Let me think: in diethyl ether, the CH3 groups are at around 1.2 ppm as a triplet, and the CH2 groups are around 3.5 ppm. Oh, but here the quartet is at 1.3, which is lower. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another structure: maybe cyclopropane rings?
