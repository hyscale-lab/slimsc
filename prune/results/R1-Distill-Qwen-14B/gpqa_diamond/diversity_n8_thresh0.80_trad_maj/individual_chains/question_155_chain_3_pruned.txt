Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, for a given quantum state. The state is provided as a column vector, which is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. 

Wait, right. The uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator itself. So the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

First, I need to calculate ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. But since the state is given, maybe I can compute these expectation values directly.

The state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2)^T. Let me denote this as |ψ⟩. 

The operator P_z is given as a diagonal matrix:
[ ħ   0      0    ]
[ 0   0      0    ]
[ 0   0   -ħ    ]

So P_z is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ in the given basis (which are the basis vectors of P_z). Oh wait, the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, so each basis vector corresponds to one of the eigenstates of P_z. 

Since each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z, this should simplify things because the matrix elements are known.

Now, to compute the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩: 

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. 

Since the state is a column vector (a, b, c)^T, the expectation value is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the square of their amplitudes. Because P_z is diagonal, when you multiply P_z with |ψ⟩, you just scale each component by the corresponding diagonal element. Then, the inner product with ⟨ψ| gives the sum of (a* * (P_z)_11 * a) + (b* * (P_z)_22 * b) + (c* * (P_z)_33 * c).

Wait, P_z in matrix form is:
