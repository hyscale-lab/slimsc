Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Wait, molecular formula... let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=(10)/2=5. So five degrees: probably a ring and some double bonds or maybe an aromatic ring.

The NMR data is given. Let me look at that. 1H-NMR (ppm): 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Hmm. Let's think about each peak. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet, likely an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be that high, but in this case, the triplet suggests maybe coupling with another proton. Or maybe it's an enol form or something else. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is usually a singlet, but not always. Let me think—wait, an aldehyde proton typically doesn't split into a triplet because it's only next to one proton, so maybe it's an aromatic OH? No, because OH is usually broader and maybe like 5 ppm or so if it's an aldehyde, but wait, no, aromatic OHs are usually around 5 ppm or lower. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to an aldehyde, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H) suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, two doublets each integrating for 2H. So a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. Wait, but wait, 6.98 is more downfield than 6.51. So maybe the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on one ring and electron-donating groups (EDGs) on another part? Or perhaps one ring is attached to something else.

Then 6.27 (bs, 2H) — broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe an aromatic proton that's exchanging, like an -OH group, but wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe two protons in an environment where they're not split much. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a vinyl group, but the absence of splitting makes me think of something else. Hmm.

The 3.66 (d, 2H) — a doublet, 2H. That could be a methylene group attached to something deshielded. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps part of a ring, like a cyclopropane, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aromatic ring with substituents. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Let me think about possible functional groups. The presence of N suggests maybe an amide, amine, or something else. But given the reaction steps, which I need to consider, let's wait on that.

The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl — that's usually a nitrous acid condition, used for diazotization. So the compound must have an aromatic amine group because diazotization occurs with amines, typically aryl amines. But wait, the compound's formula is C8H9NO. So, if it's an aromatic amine, maybe a benzylamine or aniline derivative. But let me think: the NMR doesn't show any broad singlet around 4 ppm which would be typical for an NH group. Hmm, that's a problem. Unless the amine is part of a more complex structure or perhaps not an NH group.

Wait, but wait. The molecular formula has one N and one O. So, maybe it's an aromatic ring with an amino group (NH2) and an oxygen-containing group, like an ether or ketone. Alternatively, the O could be part of a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, the N could be in an amide group. But the initial compound might have an aromatic ring with substituents like a nitro group or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with some substituents. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet, so maybe it's an aldehyde. But then, if the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, the NMR would show a strong aldehyde peak.

Wait, let me think again about the NMR data.

- 9.72 (t, 1H): perhaps an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde is usually a singlet, but if it's adjacent to another proton, like in a propargyl aldehyde or something, maybe it's split. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to an oxygen, but that's less likely.

- The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each for 2H: maybe two para-substituted aromatic rings? Or perhaps a single ring with two substituents in para positions. Wait, but the integration for each is 2H, so perhaps two rings each with two substituents. Or perhaps two substituents on the same ring.

Wait, another approach: the 6.98 and 6.51 could be two sets of protons on a single benzene ring. For example, a meta-substituted ring would have a triplet, but para would give two doublets. So, perhaps the benzene has substituents in the para positions, causing the protons to split into two doublets each for 2H. So, perhaps each substituent is in the para position, and each substituent causes the adjacent protons to be split.

So, maybe the benzene ring has substituents at the para positions, like two substituents. But then, the integration is 2H each, which would imply that each substituent is on a benzene ring, each causing a doublet of two protons. So maybe the molecule has two benzene rings attached to some structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, if it's two benzene rings, each is C6H5. But two benzene rings would be C12, but the formula is C8, so that can't be. So perhaps it's one benzene ring and another group. Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring with substituents that aren't benzene rings.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let me think. Let me count the carbons. The formula is C8H9NO. So, perhaps one benzene ring (6 carbons) plus a side chain of two carbons (maybe) plus the N and O.

Let me see: if the benzene is substituted with a group that has a carbonyl, perhaps an aldehyde. So maybe O=CH- attached to the benzene. But that would be a benzaldehyde. Then, the side chain could have some substituents.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet of 2H. So, maybe a CH2 group adjacent to something. Let's say OCH2, like an ether or ester. So, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an OCH2 group attached, and perhaps another substituent.

But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: benzene is 6 carbons, then OCH2 would take two more (but that's 6+2=8, but that can't be because OCH2 is one oxygen, but we have one N as well). Hmm, not quite.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes an oxygen and a nitrogen. Let me think: maybe it's a structure where the benzene ring is connected via a chain that includes an amide or an amino group. Alternatively, think about the reaction steps.

The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl — diazotization, which typically converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt.

2. H2O — hydrolysis, which would convert the diazonium salt to a phenol if it's an aryl diazonium salt.

3. aq. KOH, heat — perhaps a nucleophilic
