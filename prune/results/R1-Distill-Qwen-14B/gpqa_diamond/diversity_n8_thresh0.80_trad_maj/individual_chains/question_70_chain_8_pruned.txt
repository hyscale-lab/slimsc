Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the reactions step by step.

The first reaction says solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember that when a solid reacts with a gas in a specific ratio, it's often about stoichiometry. 8 equivalents might mean the molar ratio is 1:8. What could that be? Maybe like sulfur reacting with something? Wait, sulfur (solid) reacting with, say, oxygen gas to form SO3? But wait, SO3 is a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal reacting with a gas. Oh wait, maybe it's something like phosphorus reacting with chlorine gas? But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Bright red makes me think of certain compounds. For example, I recall that when copper reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid, it produces a red solution, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal compound. Oh, wait! Copper(II) sulfate is blue, but maybe a different compound. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a reaction involving vanadium? Or maybe it's a nitrate. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again.

The second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, E is produced from C and D. The fact that it's extremely hazardous—maybe something like a gas, perhaps chlorine or something toxic. Alternatively, maybe a highly reactive substance like ozone or something else.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. Strong and weak. Let's think, what produces two acids upon hydrolysis. Maybe a nitride? Or a sulfide? Wait, nitrides would typically produce NH3 and maybe something else, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe a sulfite or sulfate?

Wait, when a metal sulfide reacts with water, it can produce H2S (a weak acid) and maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate. Wait, but nitrates usually hydrolyze into nitric acid, which is strong, but that's only one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a sulfite, like SO2^−, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like NH2^- or something else. Or perhaps C is a peroxide. Wait, another thought: if C is a metal oxide, like sodium oxide, which when water is added, produces a strong base, but that doesn't give two acids. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, the initial reaction forms C, which is a product of A and B. Let me think of a reaction where a solid (A) reacts with a gas (B) in an 8:1 ratio to form a bright red product. Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving permanganate. No, permanganate is purple. Another thought: maybe A is iron and B is sulfur. Fe and S reacting in a certain ratio to form FeS or FeS2? But FeS is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: solid A could be a metal reacting with Cl2, but the product would be a chloride. Alternatively, maybe A is copper and B is sulfur
