Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs. Hmm, I need to figure out why there's no green signal when visualizing the mice. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. Oh wait, IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate protein.

Now, the vector has loxP and lox2272 cassettes. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, it's lox2272-stop-lox2272. So I think this setup is for using Cre to excise the stop cassettes. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the expression of both ligand and receptor.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for this construct in the wild-type background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, I think. So the Cre would be expressed under SOX10's control, maybe in neural crest cells.

They breed the mice, and then look under a confocal for eGFP. But they don't see green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed, or the receptor isn't being expressed. Or maybe the fusion is not working.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the vector is designed so that when Cre is active, both ligand and receptor are expressed. So maybe if they're paracrine, they don't act on the same cell? But the question is about eGFP expression, which is part of the receptor construct. So I don't know if this is the issue.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If it's stuck, then it wouldn't be on the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence. But how would that relate to the experiment? The expression was tested with Western blot, but the question doesn't say. Wait, the user says they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. Wait, but if the Western blot showed expression (from the plasmid transfection), then the receptors are being made. But in the mouse model, perhaps Cre hasn't excised the stop cassette properly, so the receptor isn't expressed.

Option C: Enhancer missing. Both the ligand and receptor need to be expressed. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, so maybe that's okay. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't need a promoter because it's part of the bicistronic construct. Wait, but I'm not sure about the regulatory elements. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the gene isn't expressed. But why would that happen? The construct includes the necessary promoters.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, that's a possibility. If the ORF is in frame, then eGFP should be part of the receptor. But if it's out of frame, maybe the protein is truncated or not expressed. But in the construct, the stop cassettes would block expression unless Cre is there. So if the lox sites are correct, when Cre is present, the stop is excised, and the receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, but the vector is set up so that the ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor. So in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent expression. So mice without Cre shouldn't express either. But the mice are homozygous for this construct, and they're crossed with SOX10-Cre. So Cre is supposed to be active in neural crest cells, which would excise the cassettes, allowing ligand and receptor expression.

So in the offspring, Cre should have removed the stop cassettes. So why is there no eGFP signal?

Wait, Western blot was done after plasmid transfection to astrocyte cultures. So they tested the construct expression. So the plasmid works when transfected. But in the mouse, maybe the Cre isn't active in the right cells, or the construct isn't expressed.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is under SOX10 control, which is neural crest. So the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells, leading to the excision of the stop cassettes in those cells. Then the ligand and receptor should be expressed, and eGFP should be visible.

But the result is no green. So maybe the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette wasn't excised. Why would that happen?

Wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272. Cre is usually specific for loxP sites. But lox2272 is a variant, right? So standard Cre may not recognize lox2272. Wait, I think that lox2272 is a mutant lox site that is recognized by Cre but is not efficiently excised unless a specific strain is used. Alternatively, maybe the Cre used isn't compatible.

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then IRES, then receptor ORF followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, it would excise the loxP and lox2272 sites. But wait, lox2272 is a different site. So if the Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the stop in front of the receptor wouldn't be excised. So the receptor-eGFP would remain unexpressed because the stop is in place.

Ah! So the issue might be that the Cre used doesn't recognize the lox2272 sites. The vector uses both loxP and lox2272. So for both cassettes to be excised, the Cre must recognize both. But regular Cre might not work on lox2272. So perhaps the stop in front of the receptor isn't excised, so the receptor isn't expressed.

So what's the problem. The mouse is homozygous for the construct, which includes both loxP and lox2272 sites. They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a standard Cre. So if the Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the stop in front of the receptor won't be excised. So the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed. Hence, no green signal.

Looking back at the options, Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's about the ORF, not the expression. If the construct isn't excised, the ORF would be in frame but not expressed.

Option B is about the receptor being stuck in the Golgi. But if the protein isn't made, it can't be stuck anywhere. So B is about expression, but perhaps the issue is more upstream.

Option C is about missing enhancer. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. So maybe C isn't the issue.

So the most likely option is that the Cre doesn't excise both stops. But the question doesn't give this as an option. Wait, the options are A to D.

Wait, let me think again. The vector is a bicistronic loxP and lox2272 construct. So when Cre is introduced, it should excise both. If the Cre isn't able to do that, then the stop remains. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But the given options don't directly address that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, none directly mention Cre's ability to recognize
