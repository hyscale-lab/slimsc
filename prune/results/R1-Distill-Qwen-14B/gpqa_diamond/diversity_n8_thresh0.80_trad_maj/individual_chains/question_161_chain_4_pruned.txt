Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this electron microscopy question. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to minimize gas molecules because that improves electron microscopy. But even after pumping, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. Mean free path usually refers to how far a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. Right, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, d is the average molecular diameter, and P is pressure. So, if pressure is lower (which it is here), λ increases. That makes sense because in a vacuum, fewer molecules mean longer distances between collisions.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path isn't λ1 anymore. Instead, it's λ2. But the temperature is the same as before. Wait, so what changed? The initial mean free path was calculated without considering the electron beam, I suppose. 

Hmm, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas molecules. So, the gas molecules might get excited or ionized by the electrons. Oh, right! When electrons pass through, they can cause gas molecules to scatter more. But wait, wait. Or perhaps the electrons cause the gas molecules to become charged, leading to more scattering events. Or maybe the electron beam induces some other effects, like heating the gas molecules, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So temperature isn't a factor here.

Wait, another thought. The mean free path for electrons in the presence of gas molecules is different because electrons have a much smaller mass than the gas molecules. Wait, but in this case, it's the gas molecules' mean free path that's changing. Oh, wait no—no, the question says Mike was looking at the gas particles' mean free path in terms of electron scattering. Wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas molecules?

Wait, no, the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1 when the electron beam is off. But when the beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2. So why would the mean free path change? Because the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to behave differently.

Wait,
