Okay, so I've come across this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, maybe that's a typo. Benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 2? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Or perhaps it's a different substituent. Wait, the name is a bit confusing.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe that's 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene. Because the '-d' might stand for something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene, but the numbering is 1 and 2. So, the bromine is at position 1, and another substituent at position 2.

Wait, the structure is bromine on carbon 1, and another group on carbon 2. But what's the 'd' referring to? Oh, sometimes in IUPAC nomenclature, the 'd' could denote a deuterium, but that's usually in isotopic contexts. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 2-dimethylamino-1-bromobenzene. Because NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution.

Wait, let me think. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, used for dehydrohalogenation, elimination, or perhaps for aromatic substitution. Wait, for aromatic substitution, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but aromatic rings are generally not that reactive. Unless we're dealing with a directing group that makes the ring more reactive.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-(something) benzene. So, the substituents are bromine at position 1 and another group at position 2. Let me think about the structure. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, that's an ortho-substituted benzene ring.

NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, but in what kind of reactions does it participate with aromatic compounds? Well, in aromatic substitution, perhaps it's involved in elimination or maybe as a base in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, another possibility is that NaNH2 is used for dehydrohalogenation, but that's usually for aliphatic halides, forming alkenes. But the starting compound is bromobenzene, which is an aromatic compound. So maybe it's about elimination? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a demetallation or something else. Wait, no, that's not common with NaNH2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure again. The compound is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. Wait, perhaps the 'd' is a typo and it's 2-dimethylamino? Because NaNH2 is a strong base, and if the ring has a strong activating group, it can undergo substitution.

Wait, but bromobenzene is deactivated. If the other substituent is a strong activating group, like amino, that could change the reactivity.

Wait, if it's 2-amino-1-bromobenzene, then the amino group is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group. But wait, in that case, the bromine is at position 1, which is adjacent to the amino group. So, when treated with a strong base, what could happen?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the amino group, leading to elimination. But wait, the amino group is a strong base itself, so maybe it's deprotonated.

Wait, here's another thought. In aromatic substitution, if you have a ring with strong activating groups, substitution can occur. But NaNH2 is a strong base, and in the presence of such a base, perhaps the benzene ring undergoes some kind of elimination.

Wait, let me consider the structure again. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, then the ring has bromine at 1 and another group at 2. If the other group is, say, a methyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So, the substituents are Br at position 1 and (CH3)2NH- at position 2. Now, in that case, the amino group is a strong activating group which directs incoming nucleophiles to the ortho and para positions. But wait, the bromine is at position 1, which is adjacent to the amino group at position 2. So, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where the amino group activates the ring, and the base (NH2^-) attacks at position 1, leading to displacement of Br.

Wait, but bromine is at position 1. If the amino group is at position 2, the possible sites for substitution would be positions 3,4,5,6? Or wait, perhaps the positions are such that the amino group is ortho to the bromine.

Wait, if the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and another group (let's say X) at position 2, then the structure is:

Positions 1 (Br), 2 (X), 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, the X group is at position 2, which is ortho to Br. If X is an amino group, which is a strong activating group, then the ring is activated in certain positions. The Br is a meta director, but the amino group is an ortho/para director. Hmm.

Wait, but in the case where the ring has two substituents, the directing effect can be a bit more complex. The substituents can influence where the next substitution occurs. So, in this case, Br is at 1, and amino at 2. So, Br is a meta director, and amino is ortho/para.

So, the amino group is at position 2. Where would the next substitution occur? The amino group directs to positions 1 (already taken by Br), 3, and 6 (para to amino). But position 1 is Br, so the next possible positions would be 3,4,5,6?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a substitution, but an elimination. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, perhaps under strong basic conditions, elimination occurs to form a benzene ring with a double bond.

Wait, but benzene is already conjugated. So, perhaps it's more about dehydrohalogenation, but in aromatic systems, that's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a benzene ring with an amino group adjacent to where the bromine was.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and it's treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the amino group, leading to elimination of HBr and forming an aromatic ring with a new double bond.

Wait, but aromatic rings are already conjugated. So, maybe it's more about removing a proton and substituting Br.

Alternatively, perhaps the amino group deprotonates, and then the ring undergoes some kind of aromatic substitution where the amino group activates the ring, making the Br leave, and the NH2 group takes its place.

Wait, but in that case, it would be a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The amino group is a strong activating group, which makes the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, perhaps providing the nucleophile (NH2^-), but nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically requires the ring to be strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually isn't the case unless there's a strong electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, that doesn't fit here because the amino group is an electron-donating group. So, perhaps the conditions aren't favorable for nucleophilic substitution.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about what NaNH2 does in different reactions. It's a strong base used in deprotonation, especially for acidic protons. In aromatic chemistry, it's used in the Birch reduction, but that's under different conditions. Alternatively, when dealing with arenes, NaNH2 can abstract protons to form benzyne intermediates.

Wait, that's right! Benzyne formation. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-aminobenzene (or similar), treating with a strong base can lead to the formation of benzyne, a diradical intermediate, which can then undergo various reactions.

Wait, but how does that happen? Benzyne is formed when two adjacent substituents are eliminated, typically via deprotonation and elimination of a leaving group, forming a triple bond, which then breaks down into a diradical or a triple bond that's unstable and can isomerize or react further.

Wait, let me think about the mechanism. If the starting material has two substituents adjacent to each other, like Br and NH2 groups at positions 1 and 2, then under strong basic conditions, the base could abstract a proton from the ring, adjacent to the amino group. Then, the elimination of H and Br would occur, forming a triple bond (like a benzynes).

Wait, but wait. The structure is 1-bromo-2-X benzene, where X is something. If X is a good leaving group, but in our case, X is a substituent that's not a leaving group, maybe amino. So, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the amino group, causing the ring to lose Br and form a triple bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, where the Br is eliminated along with a proton, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but for benzyne formation, the starting material usually has two halogens adjacent to each other. For example, o-dibromobenzene. When treated with a strong base, it eliminates both halogens, forming a triple bond. But in this case, the substituents are Br and another group (perhaps amino) at adjacent positions.

So, if the substituents are Br and amino adjacent, could the base abstract a proton adjacent to the amino group, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond?

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me imagine the structure:

Positions 1 (Br), 2 (NH2), 3, 4, 5, 6.

If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 (which is adjacent to position 2), then elimination could occur between C1 and C2, but wait, that would require the breaking of bonds. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to position 1 (Br), leading to elimination of Br and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, let me draw this mentally. If the structure is:

Br at C1, NH2 at C2. The ring is benzene. So, adjacent to C1 are C6 and C2. C2 is NH2, so the adjacent positions are C1 and C3.

So, the base NaNH2 in NH3 is a strong base. It can abstract protons from the ring. The positions where the ring protons are most acidic are the ones ortho and para to the substituents.

In this case, the amino group is at C2, which is a strong activating group. So, the protons ortho and para to the amino group are more acidic.

Ortho protons to amino are C1 and C3. But C1 already has Br, so the acidic protons would be at C3 and perhaps C6 (para to amino group).

So, the base could abstract a proton from C6, which is para to the amino group. Then, perhaps the Br at C1 leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C2. That would form benzyne.

Wait, but would that leave a triple bond between C1 and C2? Because the amino group is at C2. Hmm, that would make the structure a bit strained, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond forms between C2 and C3, but that depends on where the elimination occurs.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For benzyne formation, two substituents (usually leaving groups) are eliminated, resulting in a triple bond. In the case of o-dibromobenzene, the two Br atoms are eliminated as Br- and HBr, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2.

In our case, we have Br at C1 and NH2 at C2. So, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (NH2), leading to elimination of Br from C1 and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, if the proton is abstracted from C3, which is two carbons away from C2, that might not be adjacent.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), leading to elimination of Br from C1 and a proton from C6, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6? No, that doesn't seem right because C1 is connected to C2 and C6, so a triple bond would be between C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible products.

If benzyne is formed, it's a highly strained and reactive species. It can dimerize or undergo other reactions, but the question is about the products from the starting material treated with NaNH2.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, perhaps the reaction forms benzyne, which then can react in different ways, leading to different products.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material doesn't form benzyne, but instead undergoes a substitution reaction.

Wait, another angle: NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base but also a good source of NH2^- ions. So, perhaps it's acting as a nucleophile in a SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) reaction. For SNAr, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. However, the substituents here are Br (a deactivating group) and NH2 (activating, electron-donating). So, does the ring get activated towards nucleophilic attack?

Wait, SNAr usually occurs when the ring has electron-withdrawing groups that deactivate the ring, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack. But here, the amino group is activating, which would make the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic. So, perhaps SNAr isn't the right pathway here.

Hmm, maybe the reaction isn't substitution. Let me think of elimination. If the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and we treat it with a strong base, could the Br and a hydrogen be eliminated to form a double bond?

Wait, but benzene is already a conjugated ring with alternating double bonds. Introducing another double bond isn't straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps a ring contraction or expansion occurs, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates the amino group, but that's not the case because NaNH2 is a strong base, but the amino group is already deprotonated in its conjugate base form. Wait, no, wait. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, so the substituent is (CH3)2NH, which is a strong activating group. So, in basic conditions, perhaps the amino group is deprotonated further, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination. Let me think: if the substituents are Br and another group adjacent, like in 1-bromo-2-X benzene, and under strong base, the Br leaves with a proton, forming a double bond. But wait, benzene is already fully conjugated, so adding another double bond isn't possible. So perhaps the ring becomes more unsaturated? Or perhaps the benzene becomes a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: the bromide ion (Br-) is a good leaving group. Under strong basic conditions, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a new double bond. But in benzene, that would form a triple bond, which is highly strained but can exist in some cases as benzyne.

So, considering that, the reaction would form benzyne, which can then undergo various reactions. But the question is about the possible products. Wait, but if the reaction just forms benzyne and doesn't allow it to react further, then maybe benzyne is the only product. But the question is about the number of products, so perhaps there are multiple products formed when benzyne undergoes different reactions.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material can undergo substitution or elimination, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. Let's say benzyne is formed. Benzyne can react with various nucleophiles or undergo dimerization. But in the presence of NaNH2 and ammonia, perhaps the only reaction is the formation of benzyne, but what would that product look like?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't form benzyne but instead leads to a substitution product. Let me consider that.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-amino benzene, and the base provides NH2^-, perhaps the NH2- attacks the position activated by the amino group. But wait, the amino group is at position 2; it activates positions 3,4,5,6? No, wait, the amino group is at position 2, so the activated positions are 1,3, and 6 (since it's ortho and para to position 2). But position 1 is already occupied by Br.

So, if the substitution occurs at position 3 or 6, then the Br would leave, and the NH2- would attack. But wait, the amino group is already present at 2; would the NH2- from the base add another amino group?

That doesn't make sense because the ring can't have two amino groups in adjacent positions. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs at a different position.

Wait, maybe the position 4 is also activated. Because the amino group is at 2, which is ortho to 1 and 3. The para position to amino (position 6) could also be activated. So, positions 3 and 6 are activated.

So, in the substitution, the NH2- could attack at position 3 or 6, leading to substitution products.

Wait, but is that possible? If the ring is activated, then perhaps a nucleophilic substitution could occur, but I'm not sure because the substituents might make it difficult. Alternatively, perhaps elimination is more favorable.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a triple bond (benzyne), which would be a single product. But then, the question is, how many products are formed? If the reaction only forms benzyne as an intermediate, which doesn't further react under these conditions, then maybe there's only one product.

Wait, but the question says "how many possible organic products are there in this reaction?" So, are they considering only the products formed from the reaction and not the intermediates?

If the reaction forms benzyne, which is a diradical or triple bond, but if it's isolated, it's a different compound. But how many products would that be?

Alternatively, if the starting material undergoes substitution, maybe we get two different products. Let me think.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and the base deprotonates a position, say, position 3 (which is meta to Br and ortho to the amino group), leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond between C1 and C2 (since C1 is Br and C2 is dimethylamino), but that's not possible because C1 and C2 are adjacent.

Alternatively, elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2, making benzyne. So, the product would be benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C2, which is a diradical or a highly reactive species.

But I'm not sure if benzyne is the only product or if there are multiple products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the loss of H and Br from adjacent positions, leading to a benzene ring with a triple bond. So, that would be one product.

Wait, but considering the possible positions for elimination, could there be more than one product?

Wait, in the starting material, the substituents are at positions 1 (Br) and 2 (X). So, the possible elimination would be between C1 and C2, forming a triple bond there. So, that would be the only product in terms of the structure.

But wait, is there a possibility of regioisomerism? For example, could the triple bond form between C2 and C3? That would require the substituents to be in different positions, but in our case, the substituents are at 1 and 2. So, elimination can only occur between C1 and C2.

So, if the reaction forms benzyne, it's a single product. But benzyne is a diradical and can dimerize or react further. However, under the reaction conditions, if the reaction stops after the formation of benzyne, then only one product is formed.

But wait, maybe the starting material can undergo substitution on the ring, leading to different products.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring undergoes substitution at multiple positions, leading to multiple products. Let me think.

If the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and the base deprotonates a position adjacent to the amino group, say position 3, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which could then lose Br, forming a double bond. But wait, that would lead to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution occurs at position 4, which is para to the amino group. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the loss of Br and the formation of a new substituent. Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about the possible products again. If the reaction forms benzyne, that's one product. Alternatively, if substitution occurs, perhaps two different products are formed.

Wait, but the starting material has two substituents, so substitution would have to occur at another position. But given the substituents, maybe there are two possible positions for substitution, leading to two products.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't lead to any substitution but only elimination, giving one product.

Wait, the options are 1,2,3,4. So, perhaps the correct answer is B)1, if only benzyne is formed. Or C)2, if two substitution products are possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms two different products due to different regiochemistry.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the starting material can undergo two different eliminations, leading to two different structures.

But in this case, the substituents are at positions 1 and 2, making elimination only possible between those positions. So, only one product: benzyne.

But wait, the question is about organic products. Benzyne is an inorganic product? No, wait, benzyne is an aromatic compound, so it's an organic product. So, it would count as one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material doesn't react, but that can't be the case because NaNH2 is a strong base and would cause some reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne), which is an intermediate. The question is about the possible number of organic products, so if only benzyne is formed, the answer is B)1. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has some symmetry that allows for multiple products. If the substituents are at 1 and 2, and another group is present, perhaps the elimination could lead to two different products, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution of Br with NH2, but that would require the amino group to be in a position where substitution is possible.

Wait, if the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2, that would give 2-dimethylamino-phenylamine or something like that. But that would require a good leaving group and a nucleophilic substitution.

But earlier I thought that SNAr isn't feasible here because the ring isn't activated towards nucleophilic attack. But wait, the amino group is a strong activating group, so maybe the ring is activated enough for substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the displacement of Br by NH2^-, giving a benzene ring with two amino groups? But that would require the attack to happen at position 1, which is already occupied by Br. So, that's not possible.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to summarize:

- Starting material: 1-bromo-2-X benzene, where X is a substituent (possibly amino or dimethylamino).
- Reactant treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, a strong base.
- Possible reactions: substitution, elimination, or formation of benzyne.

If the reaction is elimination, leading to benzyne, that's one product.

If the reaction is substitution, perhaps two products are possible.

But I'm not sure about substitution. Alternatively, perhaps more than one product forms due to different regiochemistry.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material has a substituent that allows for more than one position for substitution. For example, if the substituent is at position 2, and the amino group is activating, leading to substitution at positions 3 and 4, leading to two different products.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. So, perhaps the correct answer is 2 products, option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought elimination leads to one product. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the loss of Br, forming a new structure with a substituent at position 2, leading to two possible products.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't lead to any substitution but forms only one product.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a similar problem.

Wait, in my notes, I remember that when 1-bromo-2-aminobenzene is treated with a strong base, it forms benzyne. Benzyne can dimerize to form biphenylene, but under certain conditions, it can also undergo other reactions, like trapping with other reagents.

But in this problem, the reaction only involves NaNH2 and the starting material. So, the main product would be benzyne.

But the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, perhaps the only product is benzyne, which is a single product. So, the answer would be B)1.

But wait, another possibility is that the reaction could lead to the formation of phenylene diamine if the amino group substitutes the bromine, but that would require specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a meta and para product.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again about the starting material.

If the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, and under strong basic conditions, the base abstracts a proton from the ring, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2, yielding benzyne. So, that's one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction could lead to substitution at another position, but I don't see how.

So, I think the reaction leads to only one product. Hence, the answer is B)1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The compound is interpreted as 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, where bromine is at position 1 and a dimethylamino group is at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for deprotonation and elimination reactions.

The dimethylamino group is a strong electron-donating group, activating the benzene ring and making it more susceptible to elimination. Under the reaction conditions, the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the bromine atom, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a highly reactive intermediate, benzyne. Benzyne is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, resulting from the elimination of H and Br from adjacent carbons.

The question asks for the number of possible organic products. Since the reaction primarily involves the elimination of HBr to form benzyne, and no further reactions are specified under the given conditions, the only product formed is benzyne. Therefore, there is only one possible organic product.

Answer: B
