Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group, so I'm thinking there's an ester functional group in the molecule. Ester groups have carbonyl (C=O) which typically shows up around 1700 cm^-1, and an O in the ester linkage. So the formula should have an O2, which matches the options given (all have O2).

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum details: six signals in total. Let's break them down.

First, two signals for aromatic-H. A benzene ring with two substituents can have different splitting patterns depending on the positions. Di-substituted rings can be ortho, meta, or para. But in the case of two substituents, if they are in para, the ring would have more symmetry. Wait, but in di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are in para positions, there would be two equivalent H's on each, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Alternatively, if the substituents are in the ortho or meta positions, the aromatic protons might split into different signals.

Next, the NMR shows two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. These are vinyl-H, meaning they're attached to a double bond. So perhaps there's a vinyl group somewhere, like a substituent with a double bond, such as a vinyl ester or something like that.

And then, two signals for –CH3 groups. So two methyl groups. But wait, each might be in a different environment. So maybe each methyl is attached to something different. Also, no signals for –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups.

Putting this together, the substituents on the benzene ring must include an ester group and perhaps another group that introduces a vinyl group and methyl groups.

Wait, another thought: maybe one substituent is an ester, like OOCR, and another substituent is something else. Alternatively, the substituents could be a vinyl group and another group that brings in the methyls.

Wait, the ester is O-CO-O, but the structure would be more like R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are substituents. So one
