Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Boltzmann distribution, right. The formula I remember is the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n_upper/n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the question says the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So I think the ratio n_upper/n_lower is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Or wait, no, maybe wait. The level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2, and for star_2 it's 1? Or maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 relative to star_2. Let me think.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So for star_1, (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper)/(n2_lower). Because star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

Alternatively, maybe star_1's state is twice as populated in that upper level compared to star_2. So for star_1, n_upper is 2 times the n_upper of star_2, or maybe the ratio is 2 times. Wait, the wording says "twice as excited"—so perhaps the excitation, which is the ratio of the upper to lower populations, is 2 times higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

So let's denote:

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)

But according to the Boltzmann equation, each star's ratio is (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). Since the problem doesn't mention anything about the statistical weights being different, perhaps we can assume that g_upper/g_lower is the same for both stars, so that the ratio just depends on the exponential term.

Wait, but wait, the statistical weights (g) might not be the same. Oh but the question is about the same transition in iron, so I think g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars. So then, for each star, the ratio would be proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So let's set up the equations.

For star_1: (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = A * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))  
For star_2: (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = A * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))  
Where A is (g_upper/g_lower)—same for both stars since it's the same transition.

The question says that star_1 has twice the excitation, so (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower). Substituting the equations:

A exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * (A exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ))  
Divide both sides by A, since it's non-zero:  
exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:  
-ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))  
Rearranging terms:  
-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)  
Factor ΔE/(k):  
ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, let's see, rearranging the equation:

Let me rearrange the equation step by step.

We have:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Wait, so from the previous step:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - (ΔE/(k T2)).

Wait, no, let me go back. The equation after taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Which can be rewritten as:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, or is it (1/T2 - 1/T1)? Let me compute:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ΔE/(k) ( -1/T1 + 1/T2 ) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Alternatively,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, ΔE is given as a positive value. So,

Let me denote,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But for the answer options, let's see what's in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but if we rearrange the equation, everything else is about constants.

Wait, but wait, in the equation I have:

(ΔE/k) * (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But the problem doesn't give us the value of k or T, so perhaps we can relate the temperatures via the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the equation in terms of the ratio T1/T2.

Wait, but the options don't have the ΔE in them. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps because the problem says that the energy difference is given, but in the equation, it's a constant, so perhaps the equation can be simplified in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, the equation is:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute what ΔE/(k) is. Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, wait a minute! ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, same as k. So ΔE = k.

So, (k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Dividing both sides by k:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)/k

But ln(2) is about 0.693, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (0.693)/(1.38e-23) ≈ 5.02e22 K.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the temperatures of stars are like thousands or millions of Kelvin, but this would give a huge value. So maybe I messed up somewhere in the setup.

Wait, but wait, the equation after substituting ΔE = k:

(ln(2)) = (ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, no, no. Let me correct.

Wait, the equation is:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But since ΔE = k,

( k / k ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which is exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Yes, because option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that's the correct equation.

So the correct answer is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation level of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the relevant energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann distribution states that the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is proportional to:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_{\text{upper}}\) and \(g_{\text{lower}}\) are the statistical weights of the upper and lower energy levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = A \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}} = A \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right),
\]

where \(A = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}}\) is the same for both stars since the transition involves the same energy levels.

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, so:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions:

\[
A \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot A \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \(A\) and taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \(T_1\) and \(T_2\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \(\Delta E = k\) (given \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\) and \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D: \(\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\).

**Answer: D**
