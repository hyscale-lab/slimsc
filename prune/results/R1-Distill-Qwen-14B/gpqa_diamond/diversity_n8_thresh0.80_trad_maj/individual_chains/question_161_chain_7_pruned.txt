Okay, so I have this question about a transmission electron microscope and the mean free path of gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to achieve an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The goal is to minimize gas molecules because, in electron microscopy, having a good vacuum helps reduce things like electron scattering, which can degrade image quality.

But even with that ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer. So Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules.

Now, the interesting part happens when he starts the electron beam. He notices that the mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the sample compartment's temperature remains the same. So temperature isn't changing, which is one factor affecting the mean free path. Oh, but what about the presence of the electron beam?

Hmm, the mean free path is calculated using the formula λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density of the gas molecules and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * n), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules. But wait, the formula can also be expressed in terms of pressure, since n is proportional to pressure (n = P/(k*T)).

Wait, but if the pressure is the same before and after the electron beam is turned on, why would the mean free path change? Oh, but wait, when the electron beam is active, it might be influencing the gas molecules somehow.

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize or become charged. Because when you have a high-energy electron beam, it can interact with gas molecules, causing them to lose or gain electrons. That would turn them into ions. Oh, right, because in the presence of a strong electric field (like from the electron beam), gas molecules can get ionized.

If the gas molecules become ions, their properties change. Ions have different cross-sections for scattering electrons compared to neutral gas molecules. So, the collision cross-section σ would change. But wait, what about the effect on the mean free path?
