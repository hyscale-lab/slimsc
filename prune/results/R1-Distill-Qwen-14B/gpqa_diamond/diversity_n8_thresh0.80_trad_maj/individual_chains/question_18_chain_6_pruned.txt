Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if that matters for this particular calculation. The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses are just extra info.

The data given includes some abundance ratios determined using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. The values provided are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2

And the solar photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, that would mean log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5= 1e-5.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So I need to find [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], or maybe [Si]_1/[Si]_2.

Wait no, the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that would be (n_Si_1)/(n_Si_2).

Hmm, but to find n_Si_1 and n_Si_2, I need their abundances. Let me think about how these abundance ratios relate.

I remember that [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the element abundances relative to the Sun.

Wait no, the notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). Or alternatively, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = 0 means that the Fe abundance is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of Fe to H relative to the Sun's. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/Star_1)/(Fe/Sun) = 10^0 =1 → Fe abundance in Star_1 is same as Sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is often used as the logarithm of (Fe/H) / (Fe/H)_sun, but wait. No, the standard definition is [Fe/H] = log10( (n_Fe / n_H) / (n_Fe
