Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with the ability of a compound to rotate plane-polarized light. That's when a molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, right? So they must have a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element.

The question gives four compounds, and I need to determine which of them exhibit optical isomerism.

Let me go through each one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can have different positional isomerism, but for optical isomerism, I think about the possibility of the molecule being chiral. Biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can have axial chirality. Wait, if the substituents are in positions that prevent the molecule from being a plane of symmetry, it could have stereoisomerism. Let me visualize this. The biphenyl has two nitro groups at 6,6' and two methyl esters at 2,2'. So, the two benzene rings are connected at 1 and 1', and the substituents are at 2,6 on each. Since the substituents are in positions that are not symmetric, the molecule might be chiral. Oh wait, also, the substituents on each ring are in positions that could cause the two rings to twist in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image. So this could have optical isomers. So compound 1 probably does show optical isomerism.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure. Propanoate ester: CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO-. So the structure would be CH3-COOCH3 with a hydroxyl on the middle carbon. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it becomes HOCH2COOCH3. So, the structure is CH2(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to: OH, COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH(CH2OH)COOCH3? No, wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3? Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH? No, wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoic acid: the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No
