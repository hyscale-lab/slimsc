Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options are about statements involving these matrices, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me first go through each option and see what I can figure out.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, so e^X is the matrix exponential of X. The matrix exponential is a common operation in quantum mechanics, especially for time evolution. The norm of a vector changing after multiplication by a matrix operator would imply that the operator isn't unitary. Because unitary matrices preserve the norm of vectors—so if e^X were unitary, applying it wouldn't change the vector's norm. So if e^X isn't unitary, then applying it would change the norm for some vectors.

So I need to check whether e^X is unitary. But how? The matrix exponential of X is unitary only if X is skew-Hermitian. Because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary.

What's a Hermitian matrix? A matrix that's equal to its conjugate transpose. Skew-Hermitian is when A = -A†, where † denotes conjugate transpose.

Let me check if X is skew-Hermitian.

X is:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Compute X†, the conjugate transpose.

The conjugate of X's elements:
i → -i
-1 → -1 (since -1 is real)
2i → -2i
1 is 1
0 is 0
1 is 1
2i → -2i
-1 → -1
-i → i

So X† is:
Row 1: (-i, 1, -2i)
Row 2: (-1, 0, -1)
Row 3: (2i, 1, i)

Wait, I think I made a mistake there. X's columns become rows in the transpose, and then each element is conjugated.

Wait, original X:

Row 1: i   -1    2i
Row 2: 1    0     1
Row 3: 2i  -1   -i

So the conjugate of X is:
Row 1: (-i)  (-1)  (-2i)
Row 2: (1)    0     (1)
Row 3: (-2i) (-1)   (i)

Now, the transpose of that would swap rows and columns.

So X† is the transpose of the conjugate of X.

So original X's conjugate is:

[ [ -i, -1, -2i ],
  [ 1, 0, 1 ],
  [ -2i, -1, i ] ]

Transposing that:

First column becomes first row: (-i, 1, -2i)
Second column: (-1, 0, -1)
Third column: (-2i, 1, i)

So X† is:
Row 1: (-i, 1, -2i)
Row 2: (-1, 0, -1)
Row 3: (-2i, 1, i)

Now, to check if X is skew-Hermitian, which is X† = -X.

Let me compute -X.

-X would be:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: -1, 0, -1
Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Comparing to X†, which is:

Row 1: (-i, 1, -2i)
Row 2: (-1, 0, -1)
Row 3: (-2i, 1, i )

So yes! X† equals -
