Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And when they talk about iron atoms being excited in specific energy levels, I think this has to do with their energy states and how that relates to temperature.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, wait. So, the excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation, if I recall correctly, is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels being equal to (g2/g1) multiplied by exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. 

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let's denote E as the energy difference. So, E = 1.38e-23 J.

The situation is that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait, wait. Let me parse that again. It says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, the excitation level in star_1 is higher. That probably means that the number of atoms in the excited state (let's say N2) relative to the ground state (N1) is higher in star_1.

Wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think. If more atoms are in an excited state, that would imply higher excitation. So, if star_1 has twice as excited, that means for star_1, N2/N1 is 2, and for star_2, that ratio is 1? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the excitation is higher, so N2/N1 would be higher. So, for star_1, let's say the ratio is x1, and for star_2, it's x2. The problem says x1 = 2 * x2, because star_1 is twice as excited.

Wait
