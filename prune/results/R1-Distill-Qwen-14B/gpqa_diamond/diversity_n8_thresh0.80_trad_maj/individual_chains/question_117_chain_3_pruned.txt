Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that has to do with molecules being chiral and having the ability to rotate plane-polarized light. Chiral molecules lack a plane of symmetry and have non-superimposable mirror images.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers. Let me go through each one by one.

First, let's look at the four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

I'll analyze each for the possibility of stereoisomerism, specifically optical isomerism.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' with the methyl groups from the esters. Also, 6,6' have nitro groups. So, biphenyl with substituents at 2,2',6,6'.

Wait, does this molecule have any stereogenic centers? A stereogenic center is a carbon with four different substituents. Let's see. The central biphenyl structureâ€”each phenyl is attached to another, so the central carbon (the one connecting the two phenyl rings) is connected to two phenyl groups, maybe a nitro and a methyl ester? Hmm, no, maybe not. Let me think. Wait, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Then, the 2 and 2' positions have COOCH3 groups, and 6 and 6' have nitro groups.

Wait, so each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Let me visualize this. For each ring, substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Since the two substituents are on each ring, but they're at the same positions relative to each other. So, for each ring, the substituents are at opposite ends. Does this create any possibility for stereoisomerism?

Wait, the molecule is dimethyl, so the ester groups are at 2 and 2' positions. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', which are across from each other on each ring. So, each ring has: at 2, a
