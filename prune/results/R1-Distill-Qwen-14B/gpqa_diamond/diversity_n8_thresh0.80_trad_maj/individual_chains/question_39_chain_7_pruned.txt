Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an ensemble of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. The task is to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that a wave function in quantum mechanics must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So, the probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%, which is why the integral is 1.

Wait, but the wave function given has an imaginary part. Oh, because it's written as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So that's a complex wave function. But normalization typically involves the modulus squared. So for a complex function ψ(x), the integral of ψ*(x)ψ(x) dx equals 1.

Let me write down the wave function. ψ(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Then, when I multiply them, I should get (a/(sqrt(1+x)))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts would cancel out when multiplied. Wait, no, let's actually compute it.

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i
ψ*(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5)i

Multiplying them: ψ*(x)ψ(x) = (a²)/(1+x) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) + (0.5i)(-0.5i). Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the modulus squared as [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you expand (a/s + b i)(a/s - b i) where s is sqrt(1+x), you get (a/s)^2 + (b)^2. Yes, because (a/s)^2 - (b i)^2 + ... but wait no, it's
