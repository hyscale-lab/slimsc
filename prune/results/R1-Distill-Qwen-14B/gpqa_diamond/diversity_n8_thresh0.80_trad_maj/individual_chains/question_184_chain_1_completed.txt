Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would be in such a way that the substituents are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. Let me visualize it.

Looking at the substituents:

- Position 1: Ethoxy group (-OEt)
- Position 2: tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3)
- Position 3: Nitro group (-NO2)

So, the substituents are at adjacent positions. Wait, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. That's a meta arrangement between ethoxy and nitro? Or ortho? Wait, 1,2,3 would be adjacent in a way that each substituent is next to the others. Wait, no. Let me think about the numbering. If the substituents are at 1,2,3, then each is adjacent to the next. So, 1 is next to 2, 2 to 3, etc.

Wait, but benzene is a ring. So, substituents at 1,2,3 would be in a row. So, perhaps the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. But wait, the positions might be different depending on how the substituents are added.

Wait, the main thing is to figure out the order of adding these groups. Because when you add substituents to benzene, the directing effects matter. For example, nitration is typically done under certain conditions that direct the incoming group to certain positions relative to existing substituents.

So, starting with benzene, what's the best order to add the substituents to end up with the desired molecule?

The substituents are:

- tert-butyl (which is a strong activating group, but it's a bulky group since it's a tertiary alkyl)
- Ethoxy (also an activating, ortho/para-directing group)
- Nitro (deactivating, meta-directing)

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, and they deactivate the ring. So, if I add nitro groups later, they would direct incoming groups to meta positions relative to themselves. But if I add activating groups first, they would direct subsequent groups to ortho or para.

But let's think about the sequence. The target has three substituents, so we'll need three substitution steps. But wait, maybe some steps are nitrations or sulfonations, which can be done in certain ways.

Let me outline the possible steps:

We need to add tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Let's think about the order.

Option 1: Add the tert-butyl group first. Since it's an activating group, it will direct incoming substituents to ortho and para positions. Then, add the ethoxy group. Ethoxy is also activating and ortho/para. Then, add nitro. But nitro is a meta director, so where would it go?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added early, but nitro is deactivating, which could complicate further substitutions.

Wait, but the target has two activating groups and one deactivating. Since deactivating groups are harder to substitute after, perhaps it's better to add the nitro group last.

Wait, but nitration is typically done under strong acidic conditions, which might affect other substituents. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups. Let me try to map this out.

But wait, I need to think about the order of substituents in the ring. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the substituents at positions 1, 2, 3.

Suppose I add substituents in the order: tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but nitro is meta to what? Suppose the first substituent is tert-butyl. The next substituent (ethoxy) would be in ortho or para to the tert-butyl group. Then, when adding nitro, where would it go?

Wait, but maybe it's better to consider the directing effects based on the order of addition.

Alternatively, let me try to plan the synthesis steps.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering: substituent at position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, substituents at 1, 2, 3.

Wait, that's three substituents in a row. So, 1,2,3 positions are all substituted.

So, the order of adding substituents would determine their positions.

Let me think: the first substituent would determine the positions of the others relative to it. Then, each subsequent substituent depends on the directing effect of the current substituents.

So, if I add the tert-butyl group first, as it's a strong activating group (but bulky), the next substituent could be ethoxy.

Wait, but when adding the ethoxy group, since it's an activating group, it would be directed to ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl group.

But in this target, ethoxy is at position 1, and tert-butyl at position 2. So, they are adjacent (ortho). So, when adding ethoxy after tert-butyl, the ethoxy would be in an ortho position.

Wait, but then, when adding the nitro group, which is a meta director, where would it go?

Alternatively, perhaps we should add nitro group after ethoxy.

Wait, maybe the order is: tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

But let's think about the directing. The first substituent is tert-butyl at position, say, 2. Then, adding ethoxy would go into position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl), because tert-butyl is activating and directs ortho and para.

Wait, but if the tert-butyl is at position 2, then ortho positions are 1 and 3. So, when adding ethoxy, it can go to 1 or 3. Suppose it goes to position 1 (ortho) relative to tert-butyl. Then, the substituents are 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and then where would the nitro go?

When adding the nitro group, we have two substituents: ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So, when adding nitro, it will be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but which substituent is more influential? The activating groups are ortho/para directors, but if the ring is activated, incoming groups go to ortho/para, but if deactivated, they go to meta.

But in this case, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the ring is still activated (since both substituents are activating).

Wait, but nitration is a strong electrophilic substitution, and the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So, if we add nitro next, it would be directed by the existing substituents.

So, the existing substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl). The ring is activated, so the nitro group would be directed to ortho or para positions relative to the existing substituents.

Wait, but the target has the nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl) and position 4 which is empty. So, position 3 is adjacent to 2 (position 3 is meta to position 1?), maybe.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added at position 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2) and ortho to position 4. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the order of adding substituents is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Let me try that.

First, add ethoxy group. So, benzene becomes phenyl ethyl ether. When you add ethoxy, it's an activating group, ortho/para director.

Next, add tert-butyl. Since ethoxy is activating, the tert-butyl group will enter either ortho or para to ethoxy. If ethoxy is at position 1, then tert-butyl could be at 2 (ortho) or 4 (para). But in the target, tert-butyl is at position 2. So, that's possible.

So, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the substituents are at 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl).

Now, adding nitro group. The ring now has two activating groups. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta director. So, when adding nitro, where would it go?

Looking at the positions available, position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl) and position 4. But the existing substituents are at 1 and 2. So, where would the nitro group go?

Wait, but when adding a nitro group, the ring is activated, so it should be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, let me think about the positions. The existing substituents are at 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl). So, adding nitro. Each existing substituent will direct the nitro group.

Ethoxy at 1 is an ortho/para director. So, nitro would prefer to go to positions 2, 4, or 6.

But position 2 is already taken by tert-butyl. So, possible positions are 4 and 6.

But our target requires nitro at position 3. So, that's not possible under this order. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I should try a different order. Let me think about adding nitro as the last step.

Another approach: perhaps the nitro group is added first. But wait, nitro is deactivating, so it would make the ring less reactive towards subsequent substituents. Also, nitro is a meta director, so the next substituent would be added meta to it.

So, if nitro is added first, it would be at position, say, 3. Then, the next substituent would be added meta to nitro, which would be at position 1 or 5 or something. But in the target, the substituents are at 1,2,3. So, that might not work.

Wait, but maybe the nitro is added in a way that it's at position 3, and then the other substituents are added around it.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added second.

Wait, let me plan the steps again. I need to find the correct order of substituents to get the target structure.

Another approach: think about the possible steps in the options and see which sequence would produce the target.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each option lists a series of reactions, which probably correspond to the steps in the synthesis.

Wait, each option lists a sequence of reactions, such as adding tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation), then nitrating, then another step, etc.

I need to figure out which sequence correctly adds the substituents in the right order to get the target.

Let me look at the options:

Option A:
i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3
ii) HNO3/H2SO4
iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4
Wait, the options have steps, but the numbering in option A seems a bit off—maybe a typo, but I'll proceed.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl group.

ii) Nitration (HNO3, H2SO4)

iii) Sulfonation (SO3, H2SO4) ?

iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization?)

v) dilute H2SO4

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (acid workup?)

vii) NaOH/EtBr (saponification? Or substitution?)

viii) Fe/HCl (catalyst for some reaction?)

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?)

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me think about each step.

Wait, the target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. So, the steps should introduce these groups.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3
ii) HNO3/H2SO4
iii) Fe/HCl
iv) HNO3/H2SO4
v) NaNO2/HCl
vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat
vii) NaOH/EtBr
viii) SO3/H2SO4
ix) dilute H2SO4

Hmm, this seems to involve multiple nitration steps. Let me think.

First, Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl. Then nitration. Then Fe/HCl: maybe reduction? But not sure.

Wait, Fe in HCl is often used in the Bechamp reduction, but perhaps it's for something else.

Alternatively, maybe for a coupling reaction.

Wait, I'm not certain. Let me think of another approach.

Option C:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3
ii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)
iii) HNO3/H2SO4
iv) Fe/HCl
v) NaNO2/HCl
vi) HNO3/H2SO4
vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat
viii) dilute H2SO4
ix) NaOH/EtBr

Hmm, sulfonation is a step here. Sulfonic acid groups are strong meta directors and deactivating. So, after adding tert-butyl, adding a sulfonic acid group would deactivate the ring and direct meta. But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so perhaps that's a problem.

Wait, but maybe the sulfonic acid group is later removed or replaced. For example, perhaps the sulfonic acid is introduced as a leaving group.

Wait, sulfonic acid groups can be used as directing groups. For instance, in some cases, you might introduce a sulfonic acid group, perform a substitution, and then remove it.

Alternatively, maybe the sulfonic acid is replaced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires strong conditions.

But I'm not sure. Let's think again.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
ii) Fe/HCl
iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3
iv) HNO3/H2SO4
v) NaNO2/HCl
vi) SO3/H2SO4
vii) dilute H2SO4
viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat
ix) NaOH/EtBr

Hmm, first nitration. Then Fe/HCl, which might be a catalyst for something. Then Friedel-Crafts alkylation.

Wait, but nitration is a deactivating step. So, after nitrating benzene, you get nitrobenzene. Then, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts? But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated. Nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts alkylation wouldn't proceed. So, this sequence might not work because after nitration, Friedel-Crafts wouldn't add tert-butyl.

So, Option D's first step is nitration, then trying to add tert-butyl which is unlikely because the ring is deactivated. So option D is probably wrong.

Now, let's think about the correct order.

We need to add tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups, in an order that allows each substituent to be correctly positioned.

The ethoxy group can be introduced via an ether formation, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely via a Williamson synthesis, but perhaps through a different route.

Wait, but benzene can't form an ether directly. So, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a leaving group is installed.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's tricky because benzene is not very reactive.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an alkyne or via a different substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an acylation followed by a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced as an ether via a nucleophilic substitution. For that, the oxygen would need to be a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution using a tosylate or similar.

Wait, but in the reaction steps provided in the options, I see steps like NaOH and EtBr. That sounds like an SN2 reaction, where the ethoxy group replaces a bromide.

So, perhaps one of the steps is a substitution where an ethoxy group is introduced by replacing a bromide.

So, for example, if we have a benzene ring with a bromide substituent, we could perform a substitution with NaOH and ethyl bromide. But that doesn't make sense directly, unless it's a SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), which requires a good leaving group and a strongly activated ring (like with electron-withdrawing groups).

Wait, but let me think. If we have a nitro group on the ring, it's a strong meta director and deactivating. So, perhaps after nitration, we introduce a leaving group, then substitute.

Wait, but nitro is meta, so if I have a nitro group at position 3, then adding a leaving group in position 1 (ortho to nitro? No, nitro is meta director, so substituents would go meta to it. Wait, no, nitro being meta director, a substituent added after would go to meta position relative to nitro.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, considering each option's reaction steps.

Let me take Option B and see what it does.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds tert-butyl group to benzene.

So now we have tert-butylbenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration: nitrates the ring. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, the nitration will occur ortho or para to it.

So, possible substitution positions: ortho (position 1 or 3 if tert-butyl is in position 2?), but I'm not sure. Wait, the tert-butyl is in position 2 (if benzene is numbered such that the substituent is at 2?), then nitration would be at 1, 3, or 4.

Wait, but let's say after adding tert-butyl (position 2), nitration occurs. Nitration could be at position 1 (ortho), 3 (meta), or 4 (para). Which is more likely?

Friedel-Crafts adds tert-butyl to benzene, so the ring is activated. Nitration occurs ortho/para to the tert-butyl group.

So, adding nitro group: positions 1, 3, or 4.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is meta to the tert-butyl (position 2) and adjacent to the ethoxy (position 1).

Wait, so after step ii, we have nitro at position 3. But then step iii is Fe/HCl. Fe in HCl is often used in reduction reactions, like in the Bechamp reduction to reduce nitro groups to amines. But in this case, maybe it's a different use.

Wait, but in the target, the nitro group is present, so perhaps the Fe/HCl step is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst for some coupling.

Hmm, not sure. Let me proceed.

Step iii: Fe/HCl. Maybe it's a catalyst for a substitution reaction. Then step iv: HNO3/H2SO4 again. So another nitration?

But the target only has one nitro group. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, maybe the Fe/HCl is for something else, like a coupling. Alternatively, could it be a step to remove a substituent?

Alternatively, perhaps this is a Gattermann-Koch reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about other options.

Option B continues:

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis, perhaps of a diazonium salt.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution, replacing a leaving group with ethoxy.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

But this seems to involve multiple steps, some of which don't contribute to the target molecule.

Alternatively, let's look at Option C.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: add tert-butyl.

ii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, adding a sulfonic acid group (meta director, deactivating).

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Then steps involving H3O+, etc.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this seems unlikely. The sulfonic acid would have to be removed, but I don't see a step for that.

So, probably not the correct option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

iii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

v) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps hydrolysis.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → maybe hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl → ?

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

Again, multiple nitrations and sulfonations, but the target has only one nitro group and no sulfonic acid. So perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group last, via a nucleophilic substitution after installing a bromide.

Let me think: to get ethoxy group in position 1, perhaps we need to have a bromide in position 1, then substitute it with ethoxide.

So, how to get a bromide in position 1?

Perhaps through a directing effect. So, let's say we have tert-butyl in position 2, nitro in position 3. Then, adding a bromide in position 1.

But how to do that?

Wait, but nitro is meta director, so if I have a nitro group in position 3, any new substituents would go meta to it, meaning positions 1 and 5.

Wait, but if I have a nitro group in position 3 and a tert-butyl in position 2, then the ring is activated in some regions and deactivated in others.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction where a leaving group is present.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the steps in the correct order.

The target has substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

Let me think about the order:

1. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

2. Add nitro group → position 3 (meta to tert-butyl? Or ortho to ethoxy, but ethoxy isn't there yet.)

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added after ethoxy.

Another approach: first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but benzene can't directly add ethoxy. So, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a different method.

Wait, benzene can be converted to a phenol, then protected as a phenol ether. But that's more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after installing a bromide.

So, the steps might be:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

But nitro is deactivating, which would prevent Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So, perhaps not.

So, another approach: first add tert-butyl, then add ethoxy, then add nitro.

Wait, but how to add ethoxy. Since benzene can't form an ether directly, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic substitution. For that, we need a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a nucleophilic substitution, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added after a leaving group is present.

Wait, another possibility: first add the tert-butyl group (position 2). Then, nitrate the ring in a position that's activated. Since tert-butyl is activating, the nitro could go ortho or para to it. Let's say para, so position 6. Then, ethoxy is added in position 1. Then, perhaps a second nitration at position 3. But this is getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the steps involve adding the ethoxy group via a substitution. For example, install a bromide in position 1, then substitute with ethoxide.

But how to get bromide in position 1. For that, we need to direct the bromine there.

So, perhaps:

1. Add tert-butyl to position 2 via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Then nitrate to position 3 (meta to tert-butyl).

3. Then, brominate in position 1, which is ortho to the tert-butyl (position 2) and meta to nitro (position 3). Wait, but bromine is typically introduced via a substitution, which requires a good directing group.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So, if we have nitro in position 3, adding a bromine would go meta to that, which is position 1 or 5.

Hmm. So, perhaps after adding nitro in position 3, the next step is to brominate in position 1.

Wait, but nitro is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, bromination might not proceed easily.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added before the nitro.

Wait, but if we have a bromine at position 1, and a tert-butyl at position 2, then nitration would go to position 4 (para to bromine, but bromine is deactivating, making position 4 less reactive) or meta to bromine, which would be position 5.

Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let's think about the synthesis steps.

We need to introduce an ethoxy group. One way is via a nucleophilic substitution, replacing a bromide with ethoxide.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl group.

2. Add nitro group.

3. Add bromide at position 1 via electrophilic substitution (directed by substituents).

4. Substitute bromide with ethoxide.

But for step 3, adding bromide would require the ring to be activated, but if the ring has nitro (deactivating) and tert-butyl (activating), it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps after adding tert-butyl, we nitrate to position 3, then brominate at position 1 (directed by the tert-butyl group). Because tert-butyl is an activating group, which would direct the bromine to ortho or para positions.

If tert-butyl is at position 2, then ortho positions are 1 and 3, and para is 6.

So, if we brominate after adding tert-butyl, the bromine would go to ortho (positions 1 or 3) or para (6). But if we already have nitro at position 3, bromination would go to position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl and meta to nitro?).

Wait, but position 1 is adjacent to nitro (position 3 is two carbons away from position 1 in a ring). Wait, benzene is a ring; positions 1 and 3 are separated by a carbon. So, position 1 is meta to position 4, but that's not directly relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added after nitro.

Wait, no, because nitro is deactivating, which would make electrophilic substitution difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added before nitration. But then, the nitration would be directed by the bromine.

Wait, let me go back to the options.

Looking at Option B again:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. So, nitro would be ortho or para to tert-butyl.

Assuming position 2 is tert-butyl, nitro would be at 1, 3, or 4.

But target has nitro at 3. So, maybe after step ii, nitro is at 3.

Then step iii: Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of the nitro group to amine.

But target has nitro, so this might not be correct.

Alternatively, maybe it's for a different purpose. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is a catalyst for another substitution.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the steps required to introduce the ethoxy group.

Ethoxy group introduction via substitution: need a bromide in position 1.

So, steps:

1. Add tert-butyl (position 2).

2. Add nitro (position 3).

3. Add bromide (position 1).

4. Substitute bromide with ethoxide.

Now, step 3: adding bromide requires an activating group. If after adding nitro and tert-butyl, the ring is still activated enough to undergo electrophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is a substitution reaction where a bromide is introduced.

Wait, but how? Maybe via a nucleophilic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group and a strongly activated ring. Nitro is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, a bromine can be added in a position directed by the tert-butyl group.

But if the ring has a nitro group (position 3) and a tert-butyl group (position 2), the next substituent (bromine) would be directed by both.

Wait, but activating groups are more influential than deactivating ones. So, the tert-butyl would direct the bromine to ortho or para.

So, bromine would go to position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl) or position 6 (para to tert-butyl).

But in the target, we need bromine at position 1 to substitute with ethoxy.

So, let's say after step ii in Option B, we have nitro at position 3. Then, step iii is Fe/HCl. Maybe this is for a different reaction, like a coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is for a reduction, converting nitro to amine. But target has nitro, so that might not be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for the correct sequence.

The correct order to get the substituents in the target is:

1. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

2. Add ethoxy → position 1.

3. Add nitro → position 3.

But how to add ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after installing a bromide.

So:

1. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

2. Nitrate → position 3.

3. Brominate → position 1 (directed by tert-butyl).

4. Substitute bromide with ethoxy.

So, the steps would involve:

- Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl).

- Nitration (nitro).

- Bromination (bromide).

- SNAr (substitution with ethoxide).

But in the options, I see steps like NaOH and EtBr, which is an SN2, but for aromatic substitution, it's more likely SNAr.

So, looking at the options, the substitution with ethoxy would come after introducing a bromide.

Looking at Option B again:

Step vii is NaOH/EtBr. That's probably an SN2 reaction, but for benzene, it's more likely an SNAr. So, perhaps step vii is where the ethoxy is introduced.

So, let's map Option B's steps:

1. Add tert-butyl (position 2).

2. Nitrate → position 3.

3. Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine? But target has nitro.

Alternatively, Fe/HCl is for something else.

4. HNO3 again → another nitro? Unlikely.

5. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of an amine? But if step 3 didn't reduce nitro, I'm confused.

6. H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis of a diazonium salt to a phenol? Or something else.

7. NaOH and EtBr → SN2, but with ethyl bromide, which would give ethoxy group if a good leaving group is present.

So, perhaps after step 6, a leaving group is present, allowing substitution with ethoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps step 6 is hydrolysis of a nitro group to something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding nitro, then ethoxy via substitution, then another nitro. But the target has only one nitro.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about each option's steps to see which leads to the correct substituents.

Option D seems to have the first step as nitration, which would deactivate the ring, making the next Friedel-Crafts (step iii) unlikely. So, D is probably incorrect.

Option A has steps like sulfonation and multiple nitrations. Unlikely.

Option C has sulfonation, which the target doesn't have, so probably incorrect.

So, the likely options are A, B, C, or D, but it's a bit tricky.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has the nitro group at position 3. So, when adding the nitro group, it should be in a position that is meta to the existing substituent.

If the first substituent is tert-butyl (position 2), adding nitro would be at position 1 (ortho) or 3 (meta) or 4 (para). So, if the nitro is added to position 3, that's meta to tert-butyl.

So, step ii in Option B adds nitro. So, after step ii, we have tert-butyl (2) and nitro (3).

Then, step iii is Fe/HCl. If the nitro is reduced to amine, but target has nitro, so that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe step iii is a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is for introducing a leaving group.

Wait, in Option B, step iv is another nitration. But the target only has one nitro, so this can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps step iii is a catalyst for a substitution. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate to position 3.

3. Add bromide to position 1 via electrophilic substitution (directed by tert-butyl).

4. Substitute bromide with ethoxy.

Looking for an option that has this sequence.

In Option B:

i) tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl.

iv) nitrate again.

v) NaNO2.

vi) H3O+.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) SO3.

ix) H2SO4.

Wait, perhaps steps iii to vi are for introducing a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is for something else, step iv is another nitration, which doesn't make sense because target has only one nitro.

Hmm.

Another thought: the ethoxy group could be added via a substitution where a tosylate is present. But I don't see a step for that in the options.

Wait, looking at Option B's steps:

After adding tert-butyl and nitro, the next steps are Fe/HCl, then nitration, etc. Maybe Fe/HCl is for coupling, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro in position 3.

3. Brominate → bromine in position 1.

4. Substitute bromine with ethoxide.

Looking through the options, which option includes adding bromine and then substituting with ethoxide.

In Option B, step vii is NaOH/EtBr, which is substitution. So, if before that, a bromine has been added, perhaps via an earlier step.

But where is the bromine added?

Looking at Option B:

Step ii: nitrate.

Step iii: Fe/HCl.

Step iv: nitrate again.

But that would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but the steps involve adding the ethoxy group via substitution after adding nitro and tert-butyl.

But without seeing a clear path, it's difficult.

Another approach: the correct order would have the ethoxy group added last via substitution, after installing a bromide.

Looking at the options, which option has a substitution step after nitration and Friedel-Crafts.

Option B has substitution step vii (NaOH/EtBr), which would introduce ethoxy.

So, perhaps the steps are:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro in position 3.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe introduce a leaving group, like a bromide.

iv) nitrate again → which doesn't make sense, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is for a different purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm going to have to make an educated guess.

Wait, another point: the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution, which requires a leaving group, like a bromide.

So, in the options, which have a substitution step after adding tert-butyl and nitro.

Option B's steps are:

i) Friedel-Crafts → tert-butyl.

ii) nitrate → nitro.

iii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction.

iv) nitrate again → extra nitro, which target doesn't have.

So, perhaps incorrect.

Option C's steps include sulfonation, which the target doesn't have.

Option A includes sulfonation as step iii, which the target doesn't have.

Option D's first step is nitration, which would deactivate the ring, making Friedel-Crafts impossible.

So, perhaps the correct option is B, but I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is B, considering that the substitution step (NaOH/EtBr) is at step vii, which would introduce the ethoxy group.

So, putting it all together:

1. Add tert-butyl → position 2.

2. Nitrate → position 3.

3. Introduce a leaving group (like bromide) in position 1.

4. Substitute bromide with ethoxy.

But looking at Option B's steps, after nitration (step ii), there's Fe/HCl (step iii), which might be for introducing a leaving group.

Wait, Fe/HCl can sometimes be used in the Clemmensen reduction to reduce ketones to alkanes, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, Fe/HCl might be used to prepare a diazonium salt or for another purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps step iii is for introducing a bromine.

Wait, maybe Fe/HCl is used in a coupling reaction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct option is B.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully consider the directing effects of substituents and the reactivity of the aromatic ring. The target molecule has three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. The order of addition is critical, as activating groups (e.g., tert-butyl and ethoxy) direct subsequent substituents to ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups (e.g., nitro) direct to meta positions.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group. Since tert-butyl is an activating group, the nitro group would likely be added at an ortho or para position relative to tert-butyl, not at position 3 as required.
3. **Step iii**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
4. Subsequent steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution, but the introduction of the sulfonic acid group makes this option unlikely to yield the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group. The nitro group is directed to position 3 (meta to tert-butyl), which matches the target molecule.
3. **Step iii**: Fe/HCl could be used for reduction or another purpose, but the exact role here is unclear.
4. **Step iv**: Another nitration step is included, which is unnecessary since the target molecule has only one nitro group.
5. **Step v**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl.
6. **Step vi**: Hydrolysis with H₃O⁺ and heat.
7. **Step vii**: Substitution with NaOH/EtBr introduces the ethoxy group, which aligns with the target molecule.
8. While there are some unclear steps (e.g., the role of Fe/HCl and the second nitration), this option aligns with the overall structure of the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
2. **Step ii**: Sulfonation introduces a sulfonic acid group, which is not part of the target molecule.
3. **Step iii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, but the presence of the sulfonic acid group complicates the directing effects.
4. Subsequent steps include reduction, diazotization, and substitution, but the sulfonic acid group makes this option unsuitable for the target molecule.

#### **Option D**:
1. **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group, deactivating the ring.
2. **Step ii**: Fe/HCl is used, possibly for reduction or another purpose, but the deactivating effect of the nitro group makes subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation unlikely.
3. **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation attempts to add the tert-butyl group, but this step is unlikely to proceed due to the deactivated ring.
4. This option does not align with the target molecule, as the sequence of steps is chemically implausible.

### Conclusion:
Option B is the most plausible sequence. It correctly introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by the nitro group at position 3 (meta to tert-butyl). The substitution step with NaOH/EtBr introduces the ethoxy group, matching the target molecule. While some steps (e.g., Fe/HCl and the second nitration) are unclear, this option aligns best with the desired product.
