Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to find the uncertainty in Pz, which is ΔPz. Hmm, let's break it down.

Wait, the problem says the system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. Oh wait, no, the explicit state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Right, so the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

The question is about the uncertainty in Pz. I remember that the uncertainty ΔA for an operator A is given by the square root of <A²> minus <A> squared. So ΔPz = sqrt( <Pz²> - <Pz>² ). 

But wait, since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, that means the matrix for Pz is diagonal. Let me look at the matrix given for Pz. Oh right, the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

But wait, our state is a column vector with three components. Let me check the normalization. The state is (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2. Let's compute that: (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Now, since the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, each component of the vector corresponds to the amplitude of that eigenstate. So the state |ψ> can be written as a linear combination of the eigenstates of Pz.

Wait, so the first component is the amplitude for eigenvalue ħ, the second for 0, and the third for -ħ. So the expansion is |ψ> = a|Pz=ħ> + b|Pz=0> + c|Pz=-ħ>.

Looking at the components, a is -1/2, b is 1/sqrt(2), and c is -1/2.

So now, to find <Pz>, which is the expectation value of Pz. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, the expectation <Pz> is the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities. So:

<Pz> = |a|^2 * ħ + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Calculating each term:

|a|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * ħ

|b|² = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. So 1/2 * 0 = 0

|c|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So 1/4 * (-ħ) = -ħ/4.

Adding them up: (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. So <Pz> is zero.

Now, what about <Pz²>? Since Pz squared is the same as Pz when it's diagonal (because each eigenvalue squared is just (ħ)^2, 0
