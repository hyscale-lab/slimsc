Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when a Ca-EDTA complex is present. Hmm.

Alright, the problem says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. And the temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard conditions. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I remember that the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, right?

Wait, no, wait. EDTA is usually a hexadentate ligand. Oh, right, so the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2−. The Kf here is 5x10^10. Since K is a large number, that means the complex is very stable and the reaction favors the product.

So the problem is asking for the concentration of Ca²+ ions in solution. Let me think about the complex dissociation. In solution, the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The concentration of Ca²+ will be very low because the K is so large, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. That makes sense because a high K means the products are favored, so the dissociation is minimal.

So the formula I think I need to use is the one for the dissociation of a complex ion. The general expression would be:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

Wait, but in this case, the complex is 0.02 M. Wait, is that the initial concentration before dissociation? Or is it the total concentration including the dissociated ions? Hmm, I think the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, so that would be the total concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²−], right?

So, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The EDTA in solution would be the free EDTA^4- ions and any that's bound in the complex. But wait, because the K is so large, the EDTA is mostly in the complex form. Wait, no, the EDTA is the lig
