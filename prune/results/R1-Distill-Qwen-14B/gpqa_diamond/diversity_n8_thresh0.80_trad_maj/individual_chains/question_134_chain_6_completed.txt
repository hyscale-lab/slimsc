Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. The solutions are 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I'll need to make sure my units are consistent in the end.

Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of acid reacting with a base. But wait, here there are two acids and one base. Or wait, no, Ba(OH)2 is a base, and HCl and H2SO4 are acids. So we're mixing an acid solution with another acid solution and a base solution. That's a bit confusing. Oh wait, no, no—wait, the problem says they are all mixed together. So the HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and the Ba(OH)2 is a base. So, when they mix, they should neutralize each other.

Wait, but how does that work with multiple acids and a base? Because each acid would donate H+ ions, and the base would provide OH- ions. So the neutralization would involve all the H+ from the acids reacting with the OH- from the base.

So I think I should calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, determine which is in excess. The neutralization will occur until one of them is completely consumed, and the excess will determine the amount of acid or base left, but for the purpose of calculating enthalpy change, I think we're looking at the neutralization part.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the reactions. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, does it dissociate completely? Wait, for sulfuric acid, the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), no, wait: no, actually, the first dissociation is complete, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or wait, no, wait—no, wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: no, no, no—no, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, that's not right because the first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- and that's almost complete, and then the second dissociation is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-, which is also quite strong but not as strong as the first. So in solution, each H2SO4 would contribute 2 H+ ions, right? Because H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, but I might be mixing this up. Let me think again. For H2SO4, the first H+ is fully released: H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^- (completely). The second H+ is also mostly released, so HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2- (also complete in solution). So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions per formula unit. So for each mole of Ba(OH)2, we get 2 moles of OH-.

So the approach would be to calculate the total moles of H+ from HCl and H2SO4, calculate the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2, and see which is in excess. Then, the neutralization will proceed until one of the reactants is used up, and the excess will determine if there's any leftover acid or base.

Wait, but the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So for each mole of H+ and OH-, one mole of water is formed, releasing heat (exothermic process). So, the enthalpy change depends on the amount of H+ and OH- that can react.

But wait, if there's an excess of either H+ or OH-, then only the limiting reactant's moles will contribute to the neutralization, and the excess will remain, but that excess doesn't contribute to the enthalpy change because it hasn't reacted.

So, first, let's compute the moles of H+ from each acid.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one mole of H+. So 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 moles OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Now, comparing H+ (0.28) and OH- (0.2), there's more H+ than OH-. So OH- is the limiting reactant.

So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ to form 0.2 moles of H2O. The remaining H+ will be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But for the enthalpy calculation, we only consider the neutralization of the limiting reactant.

The enthalpy change for neutralization is usually given per mole of reaction. For strong acids and bases, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ/mol (per mole of H+ and OH- reacting). But wait, sometimes the value is expressed per mole of acid or per mole of base.

Wait, no, wait. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form water. So each mole of H+ and OH- reacting releases about 57 kJ, but since it's exothermic, the value is negative.

Wait, but wait, some sources say that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is around -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So for the reaction H+ + OH- → H2O, the ΔH is approximately -57 kJ per mole.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting would release 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options: option B is -11.42 kcal, option D is -16.0 kJ. So wait, I need to make sure my units are correct.

Wait, what's the conversion between kJ and kcal? 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recalculate.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, ΔH = -57 kJ per mole. So for 0.2 moles, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's higher than -11.4, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I miscalculate the moles?

Let me double-check the calculations.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol. Correct.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol. Correct.

So moles of H+ are 0.28, OH- 0.2. So OH- is limiting, 0.2 moles react.

So the neutralization is 0.2 moles, so ΔH is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal, because 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ. So wait, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ, which is what I calculated. So why is option D present? It says -16.0 kJ, which is about -3.81 kcal (16 /4.184 ≈ 3.82). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, when H2SO4 dissociates, each mole contributes 2 H+ ions, right? So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+. So total H+ is 0.28 mol. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol, each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-. Correct.

So, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So neutralization is 0.2 moles, releasing 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy change in kJ, so option D is -16 kJ. That's not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with H2SO4. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but the first dissociation is complete, and the second is only partial. Wait, no, wait, in aq solution, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but I think the first H+ is fully released, and the second is about 100% as well. Wait no, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation, but the second is a weaker acid. So, for dilute solutions, the first H+ is fully released, but the second H+ is released but may not be 100% dissociated.

Wait, but in this problem, I think it's assumed that H2SO4 is a strong acid and fully dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, but let me make sure. If H2SO4 is 0.3 M, 300 mL: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+. That's correct.

So, the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So 0.2 mol OH- will react with 0.2 mol H+ to form water. The remaining H+ is 0.08 mol.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ.

So, the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, so that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 *4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ. No, wait, no, wait, no, no. Wait, wait, no, wait, the calculation is opposite. Oh no, wait, wait, if you have 11.4 kJ, and you want to convert to kcal, divide by 4.184.

So 11.4 kJ /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So if the change is -11.4 kJ, that's -2.72 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal.

But wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be roughly 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ, which is way higher than our calculation.

So according to this, the correct answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, the options have both kcal and kJ. Let me look again.

Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is much higher than -11.4 kJ. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the Ba(OH)2 calculation. Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. How does it dissociate? Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH-, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I considered only the first H+ from H2SO4, but actually, the second H+ isn't fully dissociated, so I might have overcounted the H+.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when the solutions are mixed. So if the H2SO4 doesn't fully dissociate the second H+, then the H+ from H2SO4 would be less. But this complicates things, and perhaps the problem expects us to assume complete dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ from both the first and second dissociations of H2SO4. So in that case, my initial calculation is correct.

Wait, but maybe the problem expects me to consider that when Ba(OH)2 is in solution, it provides 2 OH- per formula unit, but perhaps I should think about the stoichiometry of each acid and base.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize 2 moles of H+.

Because, for each OH-, you need one H+. So 0.2 moles of OH- can neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

But, wait, H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4. So, the neutralization uses up H+ and OH- in a 1:1 ratio, regardless of which acid they come from.

So, the initial calculation holds: 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 *57 kJ (negative because exothermic) → -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options match exactly. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of H+.

Wait, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

But wait, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, H+ is in excess by 0.08 mol. So neutralization is 0.2 mol.

Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So which option is correct? Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ (since 2.72 *4.184 ≈11.4 kJ). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ.

But option D is -16 kJ, which is a higher value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the molarity and volume. Let me recheck.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L = 0.09 mol. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L= 0.1 mol. So 0.1 *2 =0.2 mol OH-.

That's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should be considering the molarity and volume correctly. Wait, when the solutions are mixed, the volume increases, but for molarity, you calculate moles, which is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the neutralization enthalpy isn't per mole of H+ but per mole of reaction as written.

Wait, the reaction between a strong acid and strong base is H+ + OH- → H2O, with ΔH = -57 kJ per mole.

So, for 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, the ΔH is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So I'm confident in that.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is roughly the same as -11.4 kJ when converted. Wait, no, because 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.7 kJ. That's way higher than our calculation, so that can't be right.

So the correct answer should be either option A or D.

Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's 16 kJ, which would be approximately 3.82 kcal (16 /4.184 ≈3.82).

Hmm, so why isn't the answer matching any of these? Did I make a mistake in the initial calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but only the first H+ dissociates completely, and the second only partially. So in reality, maybe the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 1 = 0.09 mol, not 0.18. So let me recalculate that.

If H2SO4 only donates one H+ per molecule, then 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 mol H+. Plus HCl's 0.1 mol H+ gives 0.19 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.19 mol, OH- 0.2 mol. So H+ is the limiting reactant. Then, 0.19 mol neutralized.

So ΔH = 0.19 * (-57) ≈-10.83 kJ.

Which is approximately -2.59 kcal.

But that's not one of the options either. Alternatively, perhaps that's not the case. So I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, but the problem statement says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when the solutions are mixed. So I think the correct approach is to assume complete dissociation of H2SO4, giving 2 H+ per molecule.

So going back, the correct enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (option A).

Wait, but why is option D (-16 kJ) an option? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the stoichiometry is different. For H2SO4, each mole gives 2 H+. So:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M *0.3 L=0.09 moles H2SO4 → 0.18 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M *0.2 L=0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 OH-.

Total H+ =0.28, OH- =0.2. So neutralization of 0.2 H+.

ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ → -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. So perhaps the mistake is in the units. Did the question ask for the enthalpy in kcal or kJ?

The options are a mix: A and B are in kcal, D and others in kJ.

In the question, it says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization', without specifying units. But the options have both. So perhaps the correct unit is kJ. Wait, but I get -11.4 kJ, which is not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H2O formed. Or perhaps the enthalpy value is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when H2SO4 is a strong acid, the enthalpy of neutralization is different because it's diprotic. Wait, but no, because each H+ contributes the same as any other in neutralization.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I didn't consider the total volume when calculating concentrations, but no, moles are already calculated correctly.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think if there's another approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the total enthalpy change considering all the H+ and OH- that can react, but perhaps I should consider if the mixture is in a certain way that affects the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture.

Wait, but I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the neutralization of each acid separately.

But that doesn't make sense because when you mix all three, H+ from both acids will react with OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering H2SO4 as a strong acid and only accounts for one H+ per molecule. So, let's recalculate that scenario.

If H2SO4 gives only 1 H+ per molecule, then:

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 mol H+.

Total H+ → 0.19 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH-.

So OH- is in excess, so 0.19 mol neutralized.

ΔH → 0.19 * (-57) ≈-10.83 kJ → approximately -2.59 kcal. Which isn't any option either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the neutralization is calculated. For example, the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is often given as -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed, regardless of the acid or base. So for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, it's -57 kJ.

So in our case, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react. So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. Which is approximately -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches this.

So the answer should be option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \). Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \). Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \). Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since \( 0.28 \, \text{mol H⁺} > 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \), OH⁻ is the limiting reactant. Thus, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol H⁺} \) and \( 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \) will react.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( \Delta H = -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of \( \text{H⁺} \) or \( \text{OH⁻} \). For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \), the enthalpy change is:
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - To convert to kcal, use \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \):
     \[
     \Delta H = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.
   - Option D (\( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \)) and Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) do not match the calculations.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A: -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A
