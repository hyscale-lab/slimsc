Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that has to do with the conservation of kinetic energy, so the electrons don't lose energy in the collision, just change direction. The question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, the problem gives me phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh, right, phase shifts are part of the scattering theory, especially in partial wave analysis. Each δ_l corresponds to a spherical Bessel function for that angular momentum l.

The scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) in the case of elastic scattering can be written using these phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * Pl(cosθ) ) ) * e^{i(lφ)} ), where k is the wave number, and Pl is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So, when the scattering angle θ is 0°, because that's along the incident direction. And φ would be 0°, I guess, since it's the direction of the beam.

So, for θ=0°, the Pl(cosθ) becomes Pl(1), right? Because cos(0) is 1. And Pl(1) is 1 for all l. So the amplitude simplifies a lot. Also, since we're looking along the beam, φ=0°, so e^{i l φ} is e^0 = 1. 

So f(0,0) would be (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1) ) ). 

But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4, so I think we include l from 0 to 4. 

The question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So let's compute the imaginary part of f(0,0). 

Each term in the sum is (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l+1). Let's compute each term's imaginary part.

The expression e^{2iδ_l} can be written as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So e
