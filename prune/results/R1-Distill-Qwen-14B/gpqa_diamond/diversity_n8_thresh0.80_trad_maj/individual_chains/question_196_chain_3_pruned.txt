Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The options are A, B, C, D.

Alright, first, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. The formula is v_max equals sqrt(k A² / m), right? But wait, since this is a relativistic case, things must be different because of special relativity effects. Oh right, in relativity, as speeds approach the speed of light, the mass increases due to relativistic effects. So we can't use the classical formula directly.

So the classical formula (option C) is probably not the right answer here. But I need to find the correct relativistic expression.

In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)k x². I think the potential energy for a relativistic oscillator incorporates a term that accounts for the relativistic mass increase. Wait, or is it that the Hamiltonian includes relativistic corrections?

Wait, another approach: the total energy in relativity is given by E = gamma m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. But wait, in the relativistic case, the potential energy might have a different form.

Wait, no, the problem says it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -k x. So the potential is (1/2) k x², same as classical. Then the kinetic energy is relativistic. Oh, right, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv², it's (gamma - 1) m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. At the maximum amplitude A, the mass is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. So E = (1/2) k A². At maximum speed, the mass is passing through the equilibrium point, so all energy is kinetic. So (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So setting those equal: (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A². Let me write that equation down.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so substituting that in:

( (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) * m c² = (1/2) k A².

Hmm, I need to solve for v_max. Let me rearrange this.

First, divide both sides by m c²:

( (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable to simplify. Let me call it a = (k A²)/(2 m c²). So:

(1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) - 1 = a.

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1
