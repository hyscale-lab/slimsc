Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So they're the standard spin-up and spin-down states in the z-basis.

The first part of the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i â‰  j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me think about what kind of matrix that would be.

So, if the operator matrix is 2x2 (since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles), then the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Wait, no, wait. Because for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j go from 1 to 2. So A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and A_11 and A_22 are zero. So the matrix is actually:
[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of such an operator would form a basis. Because the operator is represented as a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and same values off-diagonal, it must be a symmetric matrix, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Wait, this operator seems similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Let me recall: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if our operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, then the eigenstates are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are the spin states in the x-direction. So the eigenstates would be |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. But I'm not entirely sure; perhaps I should calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to confirm.

Alternatively, I could think about the operator A as being (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Let me confirm: the Pauli matrices are defined as X = [[0,1],[1,0]], Y = [[
