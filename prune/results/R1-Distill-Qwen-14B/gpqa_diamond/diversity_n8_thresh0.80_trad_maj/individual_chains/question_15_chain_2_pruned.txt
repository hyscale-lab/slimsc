Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one that has a higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected using the RV method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. 

From the question, I know that both planets have the same mass. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. 

Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Since the stars are similar in radius, but one is more massive, maybe that affects their brightness or something else, but for transit probability, I think it's more about the orbital parameters.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. That probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I think the exact formula is (R_star / a) because the planet's size is much smaller than the star. So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a). 

But wait, isn't the probability also affected by the inclination? Oh right, the transit occurs only if the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. The probability is the fraction of all possible orbits that are edge-on enough. The formula for the probability is usually given by (R_star + R_planet)/(a) * (something else?), but I think the main factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. 

But wait, another point: the RV method gives the minimum mass, but since the question says both have the same mass, we don't have to worry about that. 

So, the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_star / a). Because a is the semi-major axis, which is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. 

Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star + M_planet)/(4π²). But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (for most exoplanets), we can approximate M_star + M_plan
