Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x.

Alright, so I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is given by the square root of the expectation of the square minus the square of the expectation. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

First, I need to find the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩.

The matrix for P_z is given as:
[[ℏ, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, -ℏ]]

So, P_z is a diagonal matrix, which makes things easier because the expectation value is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the probabilities of each state. Wait, no, more accurately, since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the expectation value is simply the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the square of the components of the state vector.

The state is a column vector [a, b, c]^T where a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2. So let's compute ⟨P_z⟩ first.

Each component of the state squared gives the probability of being in that eigenstate. The eigenvalues of P_z are ℏ, 0, and -ℏ for the three basis states respectively.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (a^2)*ℏ + (b^2)*0 + (c^2)*(-ℏ).
Wait, because the first basis vector corresponds to eigenvalue ℏ, so the probability is |a|^2. Similarly for the others.

Let me compute each term:

a = -1/2 → |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So term 1: (1/4) * ℏ.

b = 1/sqrt(2) → |b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. But the eigenvalue for the middle state is 0, so term 2 is (1/2)*0 = 0.

c = -1/2 → |c|^2 = 1/4. Term 3: (1/4)*(-ℏ).

Adding them up: (1/4) ℏ + 0 + (-1/4) ℏ = 0. Oh, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ would be the expectation of P_z squared. But since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each eigenvalue, so the same diagonal entries squared: [ℏ², 0, ℏ²].

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (a^2)*(ℏ²) + (b^2)*(0) + (c^2)*(ℏ²).

Compute each term:

a² is 1/4 → (1/4) * ℏ².

c² is 1/4 → (1/4)*ℏ².

So, (1/4 +1/4) ℏ² = (1/2) ℏ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ℏ².

Then, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) → sqrt( (1/2) ℏ² - 0 ) → sqrt( (ℏ²)/2 ) → (ℏ)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but what's the question again. The options provided are:

A) sqrt{2} ℏ
B) ℏ/sqrt(2)
C) ℏ/2
D) ℏ

So the answer should be B) ℏ/sqrt(2). But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, another thought: when you compute ⟨P_z²⟩, since the operator is diagonal, and the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is correct as calculated.

Also, since the state is normalized. Let me check the normalization of the state vector. |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1. Yep, so that's correct.

So, putting it all together: ΔP_z = sqrt( (ℏ²)/2 ) = ℏ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the operator $\vec{P}_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $\vec{P}_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the three basis states. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left|a\right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left|b\right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left|c\right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar
