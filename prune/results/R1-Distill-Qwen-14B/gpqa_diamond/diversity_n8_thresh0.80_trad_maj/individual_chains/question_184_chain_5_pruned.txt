Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a synthesis question starting with benzene and aiming to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, I need to visualize the target molecule. It's a benzene ring with three substituents. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering in benzene can be tricky. Oh right, the numbering should give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So the substituents at positions 1, 2, 3 are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups, respectively. Wait, no, the way the name is written: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So it's a meta arrangement? Let me sketch it out.

So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So positions 1,2,3 are all adjacent in a way. Wait, no, benzene can't have three adjacent substituents without some being ortho or para. Wait, the numbering would be such that the substituents are in the correct order. Let me think: 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So the benzene ring has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2 (which is adjacent to ethoxy),
