Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question says we have a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, right, the Ca-EDTA complex is a stable complex. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and the formation constant K is given. Oh wait, the problem states it's a stochiometric solution, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

I remember that the formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So if the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, that means the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are the same when the complex is formed.

Wait, but in a solution where Ca-EDTA is the only species, what's the relation between the concentrations? Let me consider that. The complex dissociates into calcium and EDTA ions. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

Since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be equal,
