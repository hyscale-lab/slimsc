Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy required for a nucleus to reach 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the question says that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Li normally has 3 protons because it's lithium. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the nucleus is Li-6, right? So it's a heavy ion.

I think the first thing I need to do is find the rest mass of this nucleus. Because in particle physics, when dealing with energy and momentum, the rest mass plays a crucial role. The rest mass energy is given by E=mc², but I'll need more than that.

Wait, the problem is about the energy of the collider, which relates to the kinetic energy of the ions. But I'm not sure if it's just the kinetic energy or the total energy. Oh wait, in high-energy physics, the energy of the collider usually refers to the kinetic energy per particle. Or maybe it's the total energy, including rest mass. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify that.

Wait, the question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed is 0.96c. So I think it's the total energy, which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Or maybe the kinetic energy? I might need to double-check.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So to find E, I need to calculate gamma, multiply by the rest mass energy.

So the first step is to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. What's the mass of Li-6? I think the atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, but wait: 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But perhaps there's a more precise way.

Alternatively, I can look up the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Wait, but maybe I can compute it from the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons. Let me recall: a proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², a neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So for Li-6 with 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

Total rest mass would be 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron mass). Let me calculate that.

Proton: approx 1.007276 GeV/c². Multiply by 3: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 GeV/c².

Neutron: 1.008665 GeV/c². Multiply by 3: 3.025995 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. Are the protons and neutrons in the nucleus bound together? So the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum because of binding energy. But wait, when calculating the rest mass of the nucleus, it's the invariant mass, which includes the binding energy. Or perhaps in this problem, we can approximate the rest mass as the sum of individual nucleons' rest masses. Because if the binding energy is significant, it would complicate things, but maybe for this purpose, we can proceed with the sum.

So adding them together: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. I think the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is actually about 6.016 GeV/c². Because I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, and neutron about 939 MeV, so for 6 nucleons, it's around 6*938 = 5628 MeV, but considering that the actual mass is a bit less due to binding. But maybe I should get the exact value for Li-6.

Wait, perhaps I can recall that the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus is approximately 6.016 GeV/c². Let me check: the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units. Since 1 atomic mass unit is about 0.9315 GeV/c². So 6.0151 * 0.9315 ≈ 5.6
