Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem states that we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when I read that, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo or misunderstanding. Because typically, wave functions are complex, but for normalization, the modulus squared is integrated over all space. Hmm.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. So that simplifies to the wave function ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5)i. But wait, that seems a bit odd because I'm more used to seeing wave functions as functions that can be complex, but perhaps this is a simple case where the real and imaginary parts are separate.

But the key part is that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3. That suggests that the wave function is zero outside this region. Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding because the wave function is given for a specific domain where x is between 1 and 3. 

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the wave function is actually a real function because the imaginary part is a constant. But that doesn't make much sense because the wave function is usually a solution to the Schrödinger equation, which can have real and imaginary parts. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is written as a sum of real and imaginary parts, but perhaps the imaginary part is a constant.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So perhaps the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5)i.

But for a wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|^2 dx must be 1. So the normalization condition is integral (from x=1 to x=3) of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) as the real part and -0.5 as the imaginary part, the modulus squared would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + [ (-0.5) ]^2.

Wait, no, because ψ(x) is a complex function, but here it's written as a sum of real and imaginary parts. So ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, where A(x) is a/sqrt(1+x), and B(x) is -0.5. Wait, but that's a bit odd because the imaginary part is constant, not a function of x. So perhaps the wave function is a sum of a real function and a constant imaginary part. 

So the modulus squared would be [A(x)]^2 + [B]^2. Because B is a constant, so when we integrate |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3, it would be the integral of [A(x)^2 + B^2] dx.

So the normalization integral becomes:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

So let's compute this integral.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C. So the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² * [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² * ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2). So that part becomes a² ln(2).

Then, the integral of (0.5)^2 dx from 1 to 3 is (0.25) * (3-1) = 0.5.

So the total normalization equation is:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

Thus, a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a minute. I thought the wave function was given as a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. So when I take the modulus squared, it's [a²/(1+x)] + [0.25], because the imaginary part is -0.5, so (-0.5)^2 is 0.25.

Yes, that's correct. So the integral becomes the sum of the real part's integral and the imaginary part's contribution.

So the normalization condition is:

Integral [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

Which, as above, gives a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8485, which is approximately 0.85. So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle confined between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

where \( i \) is the imaginary unit. For the wave function to be normalized, the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( [1, 3] \) must equal 1. The modulus squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

Breaking this into two parts:

1. **Integral of \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \):**

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. **Integral of \( 0.25 \):**

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Combining these results, the normalization equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202
\]

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8485
\]

This value is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
