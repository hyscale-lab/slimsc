Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states. The phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. They also mention to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess beyond δ₄, like δ₅ and higher, I don't need to consider them. 

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. Each term involves the spherical harmonics Y_{l,m} and the phase shifts. But when we're calculating along the incident beam direction, which I think is when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees. 

When θ is 0°, the direction is along the beam, so maybe we can find a simplified expression for that case. Oh right, I remember that for θ=0, the amplitude simplifies because the Legendre polynomials might come into play. Or wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of partial waves.

The general expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} [sin δ_l + i (1 - cos δ_l)] P_l(cosθ) e^{i m φ}, but I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to recall that when θ=0, the expression simplifies because P_l(1) is zero except for l=0. Because the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) = 1 for l=0, and 0 for l>0. 

Wait, right! The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) equals 1 for l=0 and 0 for all l>0. So for θ=0, the sum reduces to only the l=0 term. So the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is f(0) = (2*0 +1) e^{i δ_0} [sin δ_0 + i(1 - cos δ_0)] * P_0(1). But since P_0(1)=1, it's just 1 * e^{i δ_0} [sin δ_0 + i(1 - cos δ_0)].

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The general formula for f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l +1) [ sin δ_l e^{i δ_l} ] P_l (cosθ) 

Is that right? Or is there more to it? Alternatively, I've also heard that the imaginary part is related to the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l) P_l(1), since θ=0, cosθ=1.

Wait, I'm a bit
