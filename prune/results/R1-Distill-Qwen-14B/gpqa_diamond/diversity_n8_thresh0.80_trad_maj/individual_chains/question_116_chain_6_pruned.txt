Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with Compound A. Here's what I know:

1. Compound A has two signals in the proton NMR:
   - A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H.
   - A quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H.

Hmm, NMR signals can tell me a lot about the structure. Let's think about what these signals indicate.

A triplet at 0.9 ppm is typical for a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2. The integration is 6H, which suggests two equivalent CH3 groups. Because a triplet indicates coupling with two neighboring protons, each CH3 is next to a CH2.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2, perhaps in a longer chain. Wait, but 4H suggests two equivalent CH2 groups. For example, if these are two CH2 groups each next to one another, like in a diethyl group. So maybe the structure is something like two ethyl groups attached to a central atom.

Putting that together, I'm thinking of a molecule where there are two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon. So, like diethyl something. For example, diethyl ether? Wait, no, because diethyl ether would have the structure CH2CH2-O-CH2CH3, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, maybe diethyl something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the central atom is a carbonyl group. Like, a ketone. If the structure is (CH2CH3)2CO, that would be diethyl ketone. Let's think about the NMR.

In diethyl ketone, the two ethyl groups are attached to the carbonyl carbon. The CH3 groups would be next to CH2, so their protons would split into a quartet if they're adjacent to CH2. Wait, noâ€”wait, the CH3 is attached to CH2. So the CH3 would be a triplet because the neighboring CH2 has two protons.

Wait, no, the CH3 would be next to a CH2, so the protons on the CH3 would be next to two protons (from the adjacent CH2), so they would split into a quartet. Or wait, no: the splitting is based on neighboring protons. So the CH3 is connected to a CH2. Each CH3 proton is next to two protons on the adjacent CH2. So the multiplicity is a triplet? Or quartet?

Wait, the splitting is due to the neighboring group. For a CH3 next to a CH2, each CH3 proton is adjacent to two protons (the two on the CH2). So each CH3 proton couples with two equivalent protons, so the splitting would be a quartet. But wait, the integration is 6H for the triplet. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The triplet in the NMR is 6H at 0.9 ppm. That's likely two equivalent CH3 groups each with 3H, so each CH3 is split into a triplet. So, each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 group with two protons. So, for example, maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)2X, where X is another group. Or perhaps X is a carbonyl.

Wait, in diethyl ether, the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The protons on the CH2 next to oxygen would
