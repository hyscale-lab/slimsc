Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about two reactions involving different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, and the products are enantiomers of a ketone. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to find out which starting materials A and B correctly produce these products when treated with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.

Wait, let me remember what I know about these reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one, but I think more importantly, the reaction conditions and the type of compounds they reduce may differ. Oh right, LiBH4 is typically used for reducing carbonyl groups to alcohols, while BH3 is used for hydroboration reactions, maybe in ketones. But wait, wait. No, wait. BH3 is usually used in hydroboration-oxidation reactions, which is for adding boron to alkenes to form alcohols. Oh wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's look at the products. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone, right? A pyran ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. So the structure is a six-membered ring, with oxygen, like a pyran, and a ketone (O) at C2, and C4 has an ethyl substituent.

So the starting materials A and B are treated with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively
