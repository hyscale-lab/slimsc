Okay, so I need to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, which are atoms (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. Chiral centers can lead to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, causing the compound to have optical activity.

Let me go through each option one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   - Biphenyl structures can have isomerism due to the rotation around the central bond. Wait, but biphenyls can have different conformations, but for optical isomerism, we need a chiral center. So I'm thinking, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see the structure. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', and the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. So each phenyl ring has two substituents: a nitro group and a methyl ester (from the dicarboxylate). Now, looking at each carbon where the substituents are attached. For the 6,6' positions: each has a nitro group and a methyl ester. Wait, but are those carbons attached to four different groups? Each 6-position would have the biphenyl ring, a nitro group, a carboxylate O (from the ester), and another substituent. Wait, the structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the 6,6' positions are on each ring. Let me think about the substituents on each carbon. Suppose the 6-carbon has a nitro group, and perhaps two other substituents from the biphenyl. No, wait, the biphenyl structure would have each ring connected at positions 1 and 1', so 6 and 2 positions on each ring are
