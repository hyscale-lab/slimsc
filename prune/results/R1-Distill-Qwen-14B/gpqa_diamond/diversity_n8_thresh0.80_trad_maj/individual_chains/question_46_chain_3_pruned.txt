Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis, but let me think through this.

Alright, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means that the catalyst will break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds. I remember that Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually Ruthenium-based, and it's good for ring-closing and ring-opening metathesis, as well as cross metathesis.

The compound given is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene is an alkene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? No, wait. Wait, pent has five carbons. Let's count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? No, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait no, wait, let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2
