Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does uniform distribution mean in this context? Oh right, I think it means that the number density of stars is the same in all regions of space. So, like, stars are spread out evenly without any clumping.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star that's nearby has a larger parallax value, and a distant star has a smaller parallax. Wait, right, because parallax is in arcseconds, and it's calculated as 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d (approximately, but for small distances, it's linear).

So, let me think about this. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is constant. That is, the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, n (number density) is constant.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, I need to find how the number of stars in a thin shell with a certain parallax varies with that parallax.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of distance. Because parallax is inversely related to distance. So plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, a small change in parallax corresponds to a change in distance. For example, a small increase in plx means a decrease in distance.

But wait, the problem is about the number per unit range of plx. Let me think, the question is about N, the number of stars, as a function of plx. Specifically, how does N depend on plx when you consider a small range in plx, say delta plx.

Wait, but the stars are uniformly distributed, so the number density n is constant. So for a given volume, the number of stars is n multiplied by that volume.

So, let's model this. Let's imagine that you have a thin shell at distance d with thickness delta d. The volume of this shell is approximately 4 pi d^2 delta d. The number of stars in this shell would be n * 4 pi d^2 delta d.

But we want to express this number in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx.

So, substituting d in terms of plx, we have:

Number of stars in the shell, N = n * 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * delta d.

But delta d is in terms of distance. How does delta d relate to delta plx? Let's compute delta d in terms of delta plx.

Since plx = 1/d, delta plx = - (1/d^2) delta d. So, delta d = -d^2 delta plx. But delta plx is a small change, so we can take the magnitude, ignoring the negative sign.

So, delta d ≈ (1/(plx^2)) delta plx.

Wait, let me check that. Because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, delta d = derivative of d with respect to plx multiplied by delta plx. The derivative of d = 1/plx is -1/(plx^2). So, delta d ≈ (-1/(plx^2)) delta plx. But since we’re looking at the magnitude, it's (1/(plx^2)) delta plx.

So, delta d ≈ delta plx / (plx^2).

Now, substituting back into N:

N = n * 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (delta plx / (plx^2)) )

Wait wait, wait, let me double-check. N = n * volume. The volume is 4 pi d² delta d. So substituting d = 1/plx:

volume = 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * delta d.

But delta d = (delta plx)/(plx^2) ), because delta d = (d^2) delta plx, since d=1/plx, so d^2 is 1/(plx)^2.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-derive this.

Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx.

Differentiate both sides: delta plx = - (1/d²) delta d → delta d = -d² delta plx.

But since we're looking for the magnitude, we can ignore the negative sign. So, delta d = (d²) delta plx.

But d = 1/plx → d² = 1/(plx)^2.

So, delta d = (1/(plx)^2) delta plx.

So, now, substituting back into the volume:

volume = 4 pi d^2 delta d = 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (delta plx)/(plx^2) ) → 4 pi (delta plx)/(plx^4).

So, the number of stars in this shell is n multiplied by this volume:

N = n * (4 pi delta plx) / (plx^4) )

Wait, but wait a second. Is that correct? Because the number of stars per unit volume is n, so the number in a volume V is n*V.

So, substituting V: 4 pi d^2 delta d = 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (delta plx / plx^2)
