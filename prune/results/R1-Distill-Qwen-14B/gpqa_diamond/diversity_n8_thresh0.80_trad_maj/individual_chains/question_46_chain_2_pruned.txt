Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Let me think about what that does. Oh right! Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, basically swapping the ends. Grubbs catalyst is good for ring-closing metathesis but also for other types, like ring-opening maybe?

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch at C3. So, it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because pent is five carbons. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4,5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that makes the structure have four carbons after the double bond, but wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So with a methyl branch on C3, that would be at the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? So the molecule is symmetric? Wait, no. Wait, it's
