Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me try to think this through.

The Lagrangian given is 𝒜_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. So, this term involves a fermion field ψ, the sigma tensor, and the field strength tensor F from electromagnetism, I think. So maybe this is a term in a theory like QED or something similar.

Wait, but in QED, the interaction term is e ψ̄ γ^μ A_μ ψ, right? But here it's different—σ_{μν} is tensor, and F is the field strength tensor, which is antisymmetric in μν. So this must be some kind of higher-order interaction. Maybe it's a term in a model beyond the Standard Model, like a higher-dimensional operator.

Now, the first part is to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I need to recall how to compute the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian.

In four spacetime dimensions, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So each term's dimension should be 4, and the Lagrangian density has dimension 4.

So the Lagrangian term is [κ] [ψ̄] [σ_{μν}] [ψ] [F^{μν}].

Let me break down each part's mass dimension.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. In electromagnetism, F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each derivative has mass dimension 1, and A has dimension 1 (since the field Lagrangian is (∂A)^2, which is dimension 4, so [A] = 1). So F has dimension [∂][A] → [F] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but F^{μν} as a tensor—each component has dimension 2. So [F^{μν}] = 2.

Next, ψ is a spinor field. In four dimensions, the Dirac Lagrangian is ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The term ∂_μ ψ has dimension 4. So each ψ has dimension (4 -1)/2 = 3/2? Wait, no. Let's think again.

The Dirac term is ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. The ∂_μ has dimension 1, ψ has dimension (4 -1)/2, because the term [ψ̄][γ][∂][ψ] must equal 4. Let's compute:

[ψ̄] = [ψ] = d, since ψ is a spinor
