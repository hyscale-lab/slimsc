Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then there are a few steps, and I need to determine the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR. Let's break it down.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. The product has a light yellow solid, and its 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, what reactions happen when a dihalide reacts with KOH? Oh, probably dehydrohalogenation, elimination. Since it's a dihalide, maybe it undergoes a double elimination to form an alkene. Wait, but adamantane is a very rigid structure, so the elimination would form a double bond between the two carbons where the bromines were.

But wait, KOH is a strong base. So in the presence of two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (1,3 positions?), no wait, 1 and 3 are across each other on the adamantane structure. Wait, no. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so the 1 and 3 positions are actually adjacent in the structure. Wait, maybe I should imagine the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused. So 1 and 3 positions are on the same face, perhaps adjacent.

Wait, so if you have 1,3-dibromo, then elimination would form a bridge. But elimination of two equivalents of HBr would form an alkene. But wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. I think that when a dihalide undergoes dehydrohalogenation, it forms an alkene. So product 1 would be adamantene (dienes?), but perhaps more accurately, it would be an exo-methylene group or something similar.

Wait, but the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong peak. That's indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Oh wait, but wait—when you have a dihalide and you eliminate with a base, you form a double bond, but maybe if the conditions are different, like if it's a more complex mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form an alkene, but then maybe a subsequent oxidation? Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a double dehydrohalogenation to form a diene? But the IR peak at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, which doesn't fit a diene. So maybe I'm wrong in thinking it's an elimination.

Wait another angle: The product after KOH is a light yellow solid, which might suggest the formation of a diketone? No, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane would not become a diketone upon heating with KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Liebig condensation? Or maybe it's a substitution reaction, but with KOH, it's more likely elimination.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbene or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is undergoing a double elimination to form an alkene and then an epoxide? No, that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, the IR peak is around 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. Maybe it's a ketone. So perhaps, after elimination, an oxidation occurs. But the first step is just heating with KOH. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But wait, the IR for an epoxide would show a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the epoxide ring, and the 1720 might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone, but how would the dihalide become a ketone?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form an alkene, and then some other reaction. Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Alternatively, the product is a diene but that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the NMR data.

The product 1 has an NMR with a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a singlet for two hydrogens, perhaps an OCH2O group or a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. The 1.94 ppm (2H) suggests maybe some CH2 groups near an electronegative group or in a ring.

Wait, the integration is 2H for 4.79, which might be a methylene group attached to something. The 4.79 is upfield for such a group, but maybe if it's in a ring or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But then the H NMR wouldn't have a peak at 4.79 ppm for two H's. Maybe it's an epoxide. Let's think: in epoxides, the hydrogens are usually around 3-5 ppm, often as a triplet or quartet depending on neighboring groups. Wait, but 4.79 is a singlet for 2H. Maybe it's a bridgehead methylene in a bicyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is the formation of the epoxide. But wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ doesn't fit an epoxide. Epoxides have C-O-C stretch around 1250-1050 cm⁻¹. So that's not it.

Another thought: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong, probably a carbonyl group. So maybe the product is a ketone. But how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination with KOH, which is a strong base, but more likely, it's an E2 mechanism. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two molecules of HBr, forming a double bond. But then, wait, would that lead to a carbonyl group? Not unless there's some oxidation.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible products. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons (if 1 and 3 are adjacent in adamantane). Eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between C1 and C3. But wait, in adamantane, the positions are in a diamond structure, so the 1 and 3 positions may be across from each other.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon elimination, it becomes 1,3-didehydrodiamantane or something, but that may not form a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach. Looking at the NMR data of product 1: the peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a ketone adjacent to a CH2 group. Or maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether.

Wait, another possibility arises: the product is a Dieckmann cyclization product or some kind of cyclic ether. Wait, but without an alcohol, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH is a double elimination to form a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone, but how? Maybe the two bromines are replaced by ketone groups. Wait, but that would require some sort of oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. So perhaps that's not it.

Another angle: the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. If product 1 is a ketone, then how did the dihalide become a ketone? Maybe through a substitution reaction. Wait, but with KOH, it's more of a base than a nucleophile for substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination. But Hofmann elimination typically forms amines, not ketones. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps elimination forms a double bond, and then an oxidation occurs. But the first step is only heating with KOH. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane with an oxygen bridge. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a dihydroxy compound. Wait, but diols don't have a strong carbonyl peak.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a carbonyl through elimination followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a coupling reaction with KOH, but I don't think so.

Wait, let me think again. KOH at high temperature. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane could lose two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. So the product would be a diene, but where's the carbonyl from? Maybe the diene is cyclic, like a cyclohexene ring. But that doesn't explain the IR.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because I don't know the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me try to imagine it. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a cage-like molecule with four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent on the same face. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent carbons.

When KOH is added, each Br could be eliminated, but with two Brs, perhaps it's a double elimination. So each elimination would form a double bond, but since the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form a conjugated diene? But then, how would that lead to a carbonyl group?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a bridge, which creates a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require some kind of ring contraction or expansion. For example, if the elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is norbornene or something similar. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with a bridge. The NMR would have certain peaks. Let me think: norbornene's NMR has peaks for the bridgehead protons around 2 ppm, and the exo and endo protons around 1.5-2.5 ppm. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the product 1 has an NMR with 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a higher ppm, which might suggest that these are the exo protons in a bicyclic structure. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) might be the protons on the bridge and adjacent carbons, and 1.94 (2H) could be some other protons, maybe the endo protons in a bridge.

But the IR peak is 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's not an alkene but a ketone.

Wait, another thought: maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a ketone via some rearrangement. For example, a pinacol rearrangement? But pinacol rearrangement requires vicinal diols, not dihalides.

Wait, perhaps it's a Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is converted into a geminal diol, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene, and then some kind of electrocyclic ring-opening to form a carbonyl. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is 1,3-dibromo-1,3-diamantane (I'm not sure if that's correct). Eliminating two HBr would form a 1,3-didehydrodiamantane, but that's just a diene.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look at the next step to get more clues.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is usually a Lewis acid catalyst. It's used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an aromatic compound, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Alternatively, product 1 could be a ketone, and with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation or alkylation.

Wait, product 1's IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone, which makes sense. So product 2 would be the result of this ketone reacting with aluminum isopropoxide. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but since the starting material is adamantane (which isn't aromatic), perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a ketone, heating it with aluminum isopropoxide might cause some kind of rearrangement or elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen or aldol condensation, but that would require another carbonyl group nearby.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a ring-opening or some kind of enol formation.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and when treated with a Lewis acid, it forms a more substituted carbonyl or undergoes some ring expansion.

Hmm, but without knowing product 1's structure, it's challenging to proceed.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH gives a light yellow solid. The IR peak at 1720 suggests a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is a double elimination followed by an oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Wait, unless the elimination forms a diradical or something that could form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation forming a carbene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide, but how? 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could form a diol, but that's a substitution, but why would there be an epoxide?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a diepoxy structure. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diepoxide. Then, the IR would have peaks for the epoxide, but the 1720 cm⁻¹ doesn't fit. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is getting too confusing. Let me think about other possibilities.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet. Could this be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether? So perhaps it's a diethyl ether or something similar, but in the adamantane structure.

Wait, but how does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But with KOH, which is a strong base, perhaps the bromide leaves, and the oxygen from KOH attacks. But wait, it's a dihalide, so perhaps elimination is more likely.

Alternative thought: Maybe the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and KOH induces a double elimination to form an alkene, but the structure is such that the alkene is in a bridge, leading to a cyclic structure that can form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps after elimination, the structure has a bridge with a double bond, and upon further reaction, it forms a ketone. But I'm not sure how that would happen with KOH alone.

Wait, perhaps the product is adamantanone, which is a ketone. Adamantanone has a ketone group in the adamantane structure. Its NMR would have a peak around δ 2.3-2.8 ppm for the bridgehead protons, maybe. Let me recall: adamantanone's structure has a ketone at the bridgehead. The NMR would show the ketone as a singlet, but in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, after elimination, maybe the product is a similar structure.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, would form a diene. But how would that become a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial elimination forms a cyclopropane ring with an oxygen bridge, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the dihalide undergoes a double nucleophilic substitution with KOH, but that would form a diol, not a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I should move on to the next step and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, giving product 3. Ozonolysis followed by workup typically cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozone would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So product 3 would be the result of cleaving product 2's double bond. Therefore, product 2 must be a compound with a double bond.

Putting this together: Product 1 is derived from product 1,3-dibromoadamantane via KOH, leading to a ketone (product 1, as per the IR). Then, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 to form product 2, which has a double bond that undergoes ozonolysis in the next step.

So, let's backtrack. Product 1 is a ketone. When product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

Wait, Al(OiPr)3 is a strong Lewis acid. It can catalyze the elimination of a molecule of water from a carbonyl compound, forming an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone). So if product 1 is a ketone with adjacent protons, heating with Al(OiPr)3 would lead to dehydration, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (product 2).

So, product 2 would be an enone.

Then, when product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, the double bond (enone) would be cleaved. Ozonolysis of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups on each end.

But wait, the ozonolysis of an enone typically gives a diketone if the double bond is between two carbons each with a substituent. Alternatively, depending on the structure, it could produce different products.

But the ozonolysis is followed by dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive workup. So it would break the ozonides into carbonyl groups.

Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange with D2O).

So, product 3 is the result of ozonolysis of product 2, which is an enone derived from product 1, which is a ketone derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

So, putting it all together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (a ketone via elimination, perhaps via dehydrohalogenation and oxidation or rearrangement).
2. Product 1 → product 2 (an enone via dehydration with Al(OiPr)3).
3. Product 2 → product 3 (after ozonolysis, likely a diketone or similar with carbonyl groups).

Now, the NMR of product 3 is needed. The most deshielded hydrogen would typically be adjacent to an electronegative group, like oxygen (e.g., alpha to a carbonyl). So, perhaps in product 3, there are hydrogens next to carbonyl groups.

In the case of ozonolysis of an enone, let's imagine that the double bond is between carbons A and B. Each of these carbons is connected to a carbonyl group in product 3. So, the structure would have two carbonyl groups, each attached to their respective carbons.

Wait, for example, if product 2 is (Z)- or (E)-enone, say:

R1–CH₂–CH₂–R2 → after ozonolysis → R1–CO– + –CO–R2.

But considering product 3's structure, perhaps it's a diketone.

So, the most deshielded H in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a ketone. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring protons.

Suppose the structure is something like:

(CH₂)₂C=O

But wait, that may not be correct. Let me think of a specific structure. If product 3 is a diketone, say, (CH₂)nCO–CO(CH₂)m, then the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be CH₂ groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks the enone into two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2 group. So, the structure would be O=C–CH2–CH2–CO=O, but that's just a guess.

Wait, but in any case, the most deshielded H would be on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say that each of these CH2 groups has two neighboring Hs on each carbon.

Wait, if the structure is something like O=C–CH2–CH2–CO, then each CH2 would be adjacent to a carbonyl.

In that case, the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split based on neighboring Hs. For example, each CH2 would have two Hs, each coupling with the adjacent CH2's Hs.

Wait, but let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 is a dialdehyde or a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups.

For example, if the enone was something like (CH₂CH₂)₂C=O, ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyls. But that's not quite right.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure like O=C–CH2–CH2–CO, which would be a butanedioic acid derivative? Or perhaps it's a diketone like pentanedione.

Wait, in any case, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be on a CH2 group. Let's say each CH2 is next to a carbonyl, so each CH2 has two Hs. Those Hs would be adjacent to another CH2 group.

So, each H on the first CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would have two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but let's think in terms of splitting. Each H on the first CH2 is next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would be split into a triplet.

But wait, if each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, which each have two Hs, then the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, no. Each H on CH2-A is adjacent to CH2-B. Each H on CH2-A is next to each of the two Hs on CH2-B. But each H on CH2-B is split into a triplet by the two Hs on CH2-A. But for CH2-A, each H is seeing two Hs on CH2-B. So, each H on CH2-A will split into a triplet.

Wait, no, because each H on CH2-A is coupled to two Hs on CH2-B. So, each H on CH2-A would have a splitting based on two neighboring Hs. So, it would be a triplet.

Similarly, each H on CH2-B would be coupled to two Hs on CH2-A, resulting in a triplet as well.

So, the most deshielded Hs (on the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls) would be triplets. So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

Looking back at the options, option A is triplet.

Wait, but another possibility is if the structure is such that the Hs are in a chain longer than two CH2 groups. But given the initial structure, perhaps it's a symmetric molecule with two CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyls.

So, each H would have two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but sometimes geminal protons can cause splitting. But in a CH2 group, the two Hs are equivalent and don't split each other; they are a singlet or split by other groups.

So, in this scenario, the most deshielded Hs would be in a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely involves a double elimination of HBr, forming a ketone (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, confirming the formation of a ketone. The NMR data supports this, with peaks corresponding to a ketone structure.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**: Product 1, being a ketone, undergoes dehydration in the presence of Al(OiPr)₃, a Lewis acid. This forms an α,β-unsaturated ketone (product 2), which contains a double bond.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**: Ozonolysis at -78°C cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. The reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide results in the formation of carbonyl groups at the cleavage sites. Product 3 is likely a diketone.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl, which is coupled to two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This coupling results in a triplet splitting pattern.

Given the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, the correct answer is **triplet**.

Answer: A
