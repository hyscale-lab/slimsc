Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. Let's try to think this through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are given as different inverse powers of plx.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of p, its distance d is 1/p parsecs. So p = 1/d.

Now, the stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number density of stars is constant in space. So the number of stars doesn't depend on how far you go; it's the same everywhere. But wait, how does that translate into the number we observe with a given parallax range?

I think I need to consider the volume of space that a certain range of parallax corresponds to. Because when we observe stars, those with larger parallax are closer, and smaller parallax are farther away. So if the distribution is uniform, more volume at larger distances would imply more stars, but since parallax decreases with distance, a unit change in parallax at a higher p would correspond to a larger volume.

Wait, maybe I should model this more mathematically. Let's see. The number of stars per unit volume is constant because the distribution is uniform. So N ∝ Volume.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a small change in parallax, Δp, how many stars are there in that range?

Parallax p is 1/d, so d is 1/p. The volume element in spherical coordinates, but since we're considering a thin shell between d and d + Δd, the volume would be 4πd² Δd. Because it's the volume of a sphere shell: 4πr² dr.

But since d = 1/p, let's express everything in terms of p. So d = 1/p, meaning that Δd = - (Δp)/p². Wait, because differentiating d = 1/p gives dd = -1/p² dp. So when p increases by Δp, d decreases because as p increases, distance decreases. But when we're talking about a range in p, like from p to p+Δp, the corresponding distance ranges would be from d to d', where d' = 1/(p+Δp). So the change in distance, Δd, is 1/p - 1/(p+Δp) = (Δp)/(p(p+Δp)) ≈ Δp/(p²) when Δp is small.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me approach this differently. For a small range in parallax from p to p+dp, what is the corresponding volume in space?

So, the distance ranges from d = 1/p to d' = 1/(p + dp). The volume of this shell is 4π (d'^2 - d^2) / 3 or something? Wait, no, for a thin shell, the volume is approximately 4πd² * dd, where dd is the change in distance.

But wait, since d = 1/p, then dd = - (1/p²) dp. Because differentiating d with respect to p gives dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So substituting, the volume element in terms of p would be 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, wait, no, because when p increases, d decreases. So a small change in p (dp) leads to a small change in d (dd) which is negative. But when calculating the volume, I should take the absolute value because volume can't be negative.

So, Volume = 4π d² |dd| = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp) → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, no. Let me redo that. d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp.

So |dd| = (1/p²) dp.

So Volume = 4π d² * |dd| = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

So that's 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, wait. Another approach: the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * Volume, where n is the number density (constant). Since n is constant, as per the question.

So number of stars per unit parallax dp is proportional to the volume at that p.

So as I found, the volume element dV in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in a small parallax range dp around p is proportional to 1/p^4.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So the number per unit dp is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options are given as 1/plx^something. So in this case, the number per unit plx (dp) is ~1/p^4. So the number of stars per unit dp decreases as p increases by 1/p^4. So the answer would be option A which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when p is small (like p approaching zero, which is a large distance), the volume is 4π (1/p^4) dp. So as p increases, the volume for a given dp decreases, which makes sense because higher p (closer stars) would be in a smaller volume. So as you go to higher parallax (closer stars), the number per unit dp would be higher.

Wait, no. Because when p is larger, the volume per unit dp is smaller. So for a given dp (like increasing p by 0.1), the volume is smaller, so the number of stars in that dp is smaller, because the volume is smaller. So higher p (closer stars) have a higher density in terms of number per unit volume, but when you take a small range in p, the number per unit p (dp) is higher for smaller p?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go back.

The number of stars in a shell between p and p+dp is n * (4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p^2) dp) ). So it's proportional to 1/p^4. So for each dp, the number of stars is proportional to 1/p^4.

So as p increases, the number per unit p (i.e., per unit parallax) decreases. So the higher the parallax, the fewer stars you have per unit range of parallax.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which matches this.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let's recalculate.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the volume element.

Wait, the volume between p and p+dp is the volume of a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd. The volume is 4πd² dd.

But d = 1/p, so dd = -1/p² dp → |dd| = 1/p² dp.

So volume = 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars is proportional to (1/p^4) * dp.

Which means that the number per unit dp (i.e., per unit parallax) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the number decreases as p increases, and it's inversely proportional to the fourth power of p.

So the correct answer should be A) ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( p = 1/d \). Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars is constant in space. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell.

The volume of a thin shell at distance \( d \) is given by \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \), where \( dp \) is the small change in parallax. The absolute value of \( dd \) is \( |dd| = \frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( |dd| \) into the volume expression, the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} dp = 4\pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, so the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). This means the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as \( p \) increases, and it is inversely proportional to the fourth power of \( p \).

From the given options:
- **A)** \( \sim 1/p_{\text{lx}}^4 \): Matches the derived result.
- **B)** \( \sim 1/p_{\text{lx}}^2 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p^2 \).
- **C)** \( \sim 1/p_{\text{lx}}^1 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( 1/p \).
- **D)** \( \sim 1/p_{\text{lx}}^3 \): Incorrect, as the dependence is \( 1/p^4 \), not \( 1/p^3 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/p_{\text{lx}}^4 \).
