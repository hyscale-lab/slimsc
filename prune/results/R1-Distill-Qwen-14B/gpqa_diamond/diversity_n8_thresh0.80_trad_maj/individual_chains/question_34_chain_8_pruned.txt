Okay, so I've got this question about the Pinacol rearrangement, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let's try to work through it.

The question gives three different diol compounds that undergo Pinacol rearrangement when treated with acid. I need to figure out the possible products for each, and then match them with the options given.

First, let me remember what the Pinacol rearrangement is. From what I recall, Pinacol rearrangement is a reaction where a vicinal diol (two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons) reacts with acid. The mechanism involves the formation of a carbocation. The steps are probably: protonation of one hydroxyl group, loss of water to form a carbocation, then a hydride shift or an alkyl shift to form a more stable carbocation, followed by deprotonation to form a ketone.

So the diols given are:

1. 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol → Product A
2. 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol → Product B
3. 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol → Product C

I'll take each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first compound:

3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol. The structure would be:

CH2CH2C(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no. Let's draw it properly. Hexane has six carbons. The diol is on carbons 3 and 4. So, positions 3 and 4 each have an OH. Also, carbon 3 has a methyl group, and carbon 4 has a phenyl.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(CH3)(OH)-CH(Ph)-OH-CH2?

Wait, no, hexane is six carbons. Let me number them:

1  2  3  4  5  6

So, 3 and 4 are the diol positions. So:

Carbon 3 has a methyl group and an OH.
Carbon 4 has a phenyl group and an OH.

So structure: CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)(OH)-CH(Ph)(OH)-CH2-?

Wait, no, positions 3 and 4 are
