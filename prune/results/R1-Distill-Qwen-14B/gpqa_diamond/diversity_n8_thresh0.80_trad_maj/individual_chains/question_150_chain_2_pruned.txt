Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question gives me a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start. Let me think about what that could be. The molecular formula suggests 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, a nitrogen, and an oxygen. So maybe it's an aromatic compound because of the high carbon count and the presence of N and O.

The NMR data is given, so that's a key part. Let me look at the 1H NMR spectrum:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a pretty high ppm, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be up there too, but the triplet suggests maybe coupling with two protons. Hmm.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Aromatic protons, probably ortho to something else. Like, maybe para to another substituent?

- 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Another set of aromatic protons, perhaps para to each other. Wait, if each is a doublet, maybe they're adjacent or in a coupling pattern due to substitution.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton? Or maybe some coupling that's not split into multiple peaks. Alternatively, it could be vinylic protons, but they usually are more downfield.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This could be a methylene group attached to something deshielded. Maybe an oxygen, like OCH2 or maybe a carbonyl adjacent? Or perhaps in an ether or ester environment. The doublet suggests coupling with one other set of protons. Wait, 2H as a doublet, so each proton is next to one other proton? Or maybe each is next to another group, like adjacent to an oxygen.

Putting the NMR together: Let me try to imagine the structure. If there's an aldehyde group (the 9.72 ppm triplet), maybe it's conjugated with something. The aromatic protons at 6.98 and 6.51 might be from two different aromatic rings. Because each is a doublet, perhaps each pair is part of a para-substituted ring. Like two phenyl groups attached to the same chain.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation to get a better idea.

Degrees of unsaturation calculation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond.

The formula is C8H9NO. Hydrogens for a fully saturated alkane would be 2*(8)+2 = 18. So 18 -9 = 9. Divided by 2 gives 4.5. But wait, that can't be right because fractional degrees are impossible. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the calculation.
