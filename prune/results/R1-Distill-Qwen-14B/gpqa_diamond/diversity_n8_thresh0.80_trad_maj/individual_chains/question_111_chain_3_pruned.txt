Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products for two different reactions. Let's take it step by step. 

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong base, so maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation reaction? Wait, the substrate is a ketone, so perhaps it's a crossed aldol addition. 

Wait, looking at the structure of the starting material: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has substituents. The ketone is at position 1. Wait, numbering might be confusing. Let me think: the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1, and substituents at 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). Wait, no, wait: 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl? Oh, wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents are at position 2, which is a ethyl and two methyl groups? Wait, no: the parent chain is cyclohexanone, with substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl—so position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl? Or is it 2-ethyl and 6-methyl? I think I'm getting confused. Let me draw the structure. 

Cyclohexanone has the ketone at position 1. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent. The substituents are at 2 and 6. So 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl—wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the substituents are 2-ethyl, 2-methyl, and 6-methyl? No, the full name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents at position 2 are ethyl and methyl? So position 2 has two substituents: ethyl and methyl? So it's a quaternary carbon at position 2, with a CH2 group attached to the ring. Or maybe is it a bridge structure? Hmm, perhaps the structure is that the cyclohex
