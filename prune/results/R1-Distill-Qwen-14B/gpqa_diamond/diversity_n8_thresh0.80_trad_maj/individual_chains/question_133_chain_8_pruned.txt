Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C. The Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The options are A to D, with various concentrations.

Hmm. So, I'm a bit rusty on buffer solutions and phosphate equilibria, but I'll try. I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH—like H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2-? Or is it H2PO4^-? Or wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but that's the acid form. Hmm. Maybe I should double-check. Oh, wait, orthophosphate usually refers to H3PO4. But in solution, it dissociates into H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and PO4^3- based on pH.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. I think orthophosphate here refers to the HPO4^2- form because that's considered the orthophosphate ion. But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe it refers to all the phosphate species, but I think the problem is more about the buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, those are the dihydrogen phosphate and hydrogen phosphate salts. So when dissolved, they will provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions in solution.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so that's a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the solution is a buffer between the first and second dissociation steps.

So the buffer is H2PO4^- / HPO4^2- with the Ka2 value, which is 6.2e-8. Because Ka1 is for H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+, and Ka2 is for H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would apply here. The pH of the solution will determine the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^-.

But wait, but since the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-, I think we need to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution, considering the buffer.

So first, I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

The solution's volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

We have 1.00 g of each salt.

Let me calculate the moles of each.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / molar mass = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005606 mol.

So, KH2PO4 gives 0.007335 mol H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4 gives 0.005606 mol HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = approx 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005606 / 0.2 = 0.02803 M.

Wait, but that's the initial concentrations, but the actual concentrations will depend on the dissociation and the pH.

But wait, in a buffer solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates pH to the ratio of the conjugate base to the acid. So, for the second
