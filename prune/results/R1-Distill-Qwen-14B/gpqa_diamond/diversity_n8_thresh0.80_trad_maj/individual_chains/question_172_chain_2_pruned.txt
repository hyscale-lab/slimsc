Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between these energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the population of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

In this problem, since the question mentions the atoms are "twice as excited", I think that refers to the ratio of the populations in the excited state. So, maybe n_upper in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or wait, no: the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited compared to star_2. So the excitation level is higher for star_1, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy state. So the ratio n_upper / n_lower for star_1 is higher than that for star_2.

Wait, but what exactly is given? The energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars, I assume, because it's the same energy levels being considered. So ΔE is 1.38e-23 J for both.

So, for star 1, the ratio is n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)). Similarly, for star 2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

But the problem states that in star_1, the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, does it mean the ratio of excited to lower state is twice? Or the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2's? Hmm, the way it's phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms
