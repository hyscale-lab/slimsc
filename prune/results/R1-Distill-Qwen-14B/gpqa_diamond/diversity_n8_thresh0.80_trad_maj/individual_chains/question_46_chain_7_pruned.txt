Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A) 4, B) 8, C) 6, D) 2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Oh right, metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, exchanging the ends. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually for ring-closing or cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of the two enantiomers. But wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, maybe the enantiomers are the same? Or does it even matter because the catalyst might not distinguish? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. 3-methylpent-1-ene has the structure CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methyl branch at carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH(CH3)-? No, wait, maybe that's not right. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene should be CH₂=CH-CH
