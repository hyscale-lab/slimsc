Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction uses a different reducing agent. The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is R configuration and the other is S. So, the starting materials A and B must be different in some way that affects the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, the question is about selecting the proper starting materials for both reactions. So, A and B are reacting with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively. Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, like ketones or esters. BH3, which is typically used in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration reactions or maybe in some reductions as well.

Wait, but in this case, since both reactions are giving a ketone (the product has a ketone group), maybe the starting materials are esters or something that gets reduced to a ketone. Oh, right! The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. Tetrahydropyran is a cyclic ether, like a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The 2-one part indicates a ketone at position 2.

So the product is a cyclic ketone. How do you get a cyclic ketone from a reducing agent? Let me think. Maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Because when you reduce a lactone, you'd open the ring and form a diol or something else. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide? No, that doesn't make sense because reducing an epoxide... Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl group that's being reduced.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring with oxygen at position 1, a ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

If the starting materials are being reduced to form this, perhaps they are esters. Wait, wait, no, LiBH4 usually reduces esters to alcohols, but in certain conditions, maybe it can do something else.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides? Because LiBH4 can open epoxides. Or maybe they are carbonyl groups within a ring. Oh wait, another possibility: the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone substituent. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the product is a ketone in a ring. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ketone or something that, upon reduction, forms the ring. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides that upon reduction form the ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are some kind of lactones. Because when you reduce a lactone, you get a diol, but that's not a ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the starting material might be an ester, and the reducing agent is doing a reduction to form a secondary alcohol. Wait, but the product is a ketone. So maybe the starting materials have a carbonyl group that is part of a larger structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) with a carbonyl group that, when reduced, form the ketone in the ring. No, because lactones have an ester group, and reducing that would give a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epoxides. Let me think. LiBH4 can reduce epoxides. For example, when epoxides are treated with LiBH4 or other borohydrides, they can be reduced to form diols. But that would produce a diol, not a ketone. So that's not matching the product here.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the reaction conditions. The products are from two different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used in the reduction of esters, ketones, aldehydes. BH3, on the other hand, is used in hydroboration reactions, where it adds to alkenes in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov addition
