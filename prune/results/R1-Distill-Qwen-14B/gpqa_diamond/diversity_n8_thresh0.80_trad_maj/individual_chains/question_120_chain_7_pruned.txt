Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The parallax of a star (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So, a star with a smaller parallax is farther away, and a larger parallax is closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their spatial density is uniform. So, the number of stars in a given volume of space is the same everywhere. But wait, how does that translate to how many stars we see with a certain range of parallax?

Parallax (p) is given by the formula p = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if I have a range of parallaxes from p to p + dp, what does that mean for the distance? Let me rearrange that. If p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. So a small change in p, dp, corresponds to a change in d. Let's see: dp = -1/d² dd. Hmm, maybe that's useful later.

Now, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's say the number density is n (stars per cubic parsec). Then the number of stars in a volume V is n * V. But I need to find how the number of stars in a certain range of parallax (dp) depends on p.

But wait, the parallax relates to distance, so I should think in terms of distance. Let's imagine a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell is 4π d² dd. Because the number density is uniform, the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4π d² dd.

But I want to express this in terms of parallax. Since p = 1/d, d = 1/p, and dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, let me compute that. If p = 1/d, then dp/d d = -1/d². So, dp = - (1/d²) dd. Rearranging, dd = -d² dp. But d is 1/p, so substituting, dd = - (1/p²) dp.

Wait, but since p is inversely proportional to d, when p increases, d decreases. So let's think about how the volume element in distance relates to the parallax.

So, the number of stars in a parallax range from p to p+dp would be the same as the number of stars in the shell between d and d + dd.

We have n * 4π d² dd. Substituting d =1/p and dd in terms
