Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about the EDTA being protonated or anything, right? The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, which probably doesn't affect the K value much since it's given.

The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. Right, K is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. So higher K means the complex is more stable. So, if I have the complex CaY^2- (where Y is EDTA), it dissociates into Ca^2+ and Y^4-.

Wait, the formula for the formation constant K is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]). But wait, in solution, we have the complex, so I need to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions.

The problem says the solution is 0.02 M CaY^2-. So, assuming that the complex doesn't dissociate much, but given that K is so large, the dissociation would be minimal. So the concentration of Ca^2+ would be really low.

Let me model this. Let's say the concentration of CaY is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. So, the complex dissociates like:
CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

Initially, [CaY] = 0.02 M, [Ca^2+] = 0, [Y^4-] = 0.

At equilibrium, [CaY] = 0.02 - x, [Ca^2+] = x, [Y^4-] = x.

Wait, but wait! Because for every mole of CaY that dissociates, one mole of Ca^2+ and one of Y^4- are produced. So yes, x for both.

But since K is very large (5e10), which means the dissociation is not favored. So x should be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the K expression becomes:
K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10.

So 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10).

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13. Taking square root, x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is same as 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 4e-13 → sqrt is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Hmm, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7, because 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is about 6.32e-7.

So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when the stoichiometry is different, but here it's 1:1. So the calculation should hold. So yeah, the concentration is x = sqrt( (0.02)/(K) ) → sqrt(0.02/(5e10)).

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. Square root is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.3e-7. Yep, that's correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions at equilibrium. Initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and at equilibrium, the concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02 \, \text{(since \( x \) is very small)}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.

Answer: C
