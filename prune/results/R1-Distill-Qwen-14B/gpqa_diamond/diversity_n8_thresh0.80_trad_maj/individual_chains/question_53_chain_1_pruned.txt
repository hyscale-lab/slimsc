Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The problem says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, so there must be an ester functional group present. Ester groups usually have carbonyl (C=O) which shows up around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ in IR. So that's a clue.

Looking at the NMR data: there are six signals. Let's see what each part tells me. 

First, two signals for aromatic-H. Now, in a benzene ring, each substituent can cause the ring's H's to split into different sets. Since it's di-substituted, the ring isn't symmetric, so the H's are in two different environments. So maybe it's para substitution? Wait, no, para would lead to two sets of H's, but if they're not para, like if it's meta or ortho, the splitting would be more complex. Hmm. Wait, but the molecule has two substituents, so the ring is di-substituted. If the two substituents are in certain positions, that could affect how the protons split.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group. Wait, an ester group is usually O-C-O, but I'm not sure about vinyl H's there. Oh wait, the two substituents on the ring might include a vinyl group. So perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH₂=CH-O- ester or something. Or maybe the substituent is a group with a double bond, such as an ethyl group attached to an ester?

Wait, the NMR says two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling with adjacent protons. Let me think. For a vinyl group, like CH₂=CH–, the protons on each carbon would couple with each other. So for a trans double bond, each H would be a doublet. But if there's more coupling, like if one proton is next to another group, perhaps with more splitting.

Wait, another thought. If there's an ester group attached to the ring, the ester might have a carbonyl and an OR group. Alternatively, one substituent could be an ester, and the other could be a vinyl group. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a methyl group, but that might not explain the vinyl H's.

Hold on, the NMR also shows two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. So the molecule has two methyl groups. And there are no CH2 signals, which suggests that any methylene groups are either not present or not showing up. Maybe the structure has two methyl groups attached, perhaps as substituents on the benzene ring or as parts of other groups.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Since it's a di-substituted benzene with an ester, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. Or maybe one substituent is an ester with a methyl group attached, and another substituent is a vinyl group. But wait, the ester group typically is OAc (acetyloxy), which is O-C-O, connected to another group. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent. For example, the benzene ring might have two substituents: one ester group (like -OOCR) and another group that includes a vinyl and methyl groups.

Wait, another approach: let's count the hydrogens.

The molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The degrees of unsaturation can help. For C11H14O2: the formula is CnHmOx. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x)/2. 

Wait, n is the number of carbons: for C11, n=11. m=14, O=2.

So, degree of unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14 -0)/2. Wait, wait, O doesn't count in the formula for degrees of unsaturation, as it's treated as a substituent. So, degrees of unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2 = 10/2 =5. Which would mean 5 degrees: could be a benzene ring (3), plus an ester (which has a double bond, so that's 1, so total 4), and maybe another double bond or ring. Hmm, but wait, the options have varying H counts. Let me compute each.

Option A: C11H14O2. Degrees: (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees: benzene (3), ester (1), another double bond or ring (1). So perhaps an ester and a ring.

Option B: C12H14O2. (2*12 +2 -14)/2 = (26-14)/2=6. So 6 degrees. Benzene (3), ester (1), another double bond (1), and perhaps a ring or another double bond. But 12 carbons, so maybe more substituents.

Option C: C12H12O2. (2*12 +2 -12)/2 = (26 -12)/2=7. So 7 degrees. Benzene (3), ester (1), another two rings or double bonds perhaps.

Option D: C11H12O2. (2*11 +2 -12)/2= (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees: benzene (3), ester (1), another 2 degrees. Could be two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Now, since the compound is a di-substituted benzene, the benzene contributes 3 degrees. The ester contributes one. So the remaining degrees of unsaturation would be 1 (for option A: 5-4=1), 2 (option B: 6-4=2), etc. 

Wait, but let me think about the substituents on the benzene. The substituents could be groups with double bonds. For example, if one substituent is an ester (like OAc), which is a carbonyl, and another substituent is a vinyl group (like CH₂CH₂-O- something), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent
