Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. They're all being mixed together, and I need to calculate the enthalpy change. The options are given, but I should probably work through it without looking at the choices yet.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve an acid reacting with a base to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually exothermic, which is why the options are negative values, I think.

But wait, since there are three solutions here, I need to figure out how they react when mixed. Let me break it down.

Looking at the acids and the base:

HCl is a strong acid, it'll donate H+ ions. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid but it's diprotic, meaning it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and it's a divalent base because Ba is +2. So each Ba(OH)2 will provide two OH- ions when dissolved.

Wait, but when mixing all three, how do they react? Let's think about the possible reactions.

HCl and Ba(OH)2 would react. H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would also react. But wait, maybe all three are reacting together? Or perhaps each acid reacts with the base.

Alternatively, maybe all the H+ ions from the acids will neutralize the OH- ions from the base. That makes sense because the base can supply OH- which will react with the H+ from the acids.

So, to find the total H+ from the acids and the total OH- from the base. The neutralization will involve the H+ and OH- combining to form water, releasing heat.

So, first, let's calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl. So 0.1 moles H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+ ions. The volume is 0.3 L, molarity 0.3 M. So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 × 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each gives two H+, so total H+ is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.
