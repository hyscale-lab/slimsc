Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually related to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base.

Wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So when you mix them, the acids will react with the base. I think the first thing I need to do is figure out the moles of each reactant to see which is the limiting reagent because the enthalpy change depends on that.

Let's break it down.

First, let's calculate the moles for each solution. Molarity is moles per liter, so I'll multiply the volume in liters by the molarity.

For HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, providing one H+ per molecule.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid too but it's diprotic. So each mole provides 2 H+ ions. Oh wait, but when it reacts with a base, does it donate both protons? I think when it's reacting with a strong base, it might donate both. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. So 0.1 mol * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when the acid reacts with the base, it's an acid-base reaction. The H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. So the total H+ is from HCl and H2SO4.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent is OH- because there's 0.2 moles of OH- and 0.28 moles of H+. So OH- will run out first, and some H+ will remain.

The neutralization reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, since each mole of H+ and OH- makes one mole of water.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So each mole gives 2 H+. So in H2SO4, the 0.09 moles produce 0.18 H+.

But when Ba(OH)2 is in solution, each mole gives 2 OH- moles. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 gives 0.2 moles OH-.

So the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. Let me calculate the total H+ again.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

OH-: 0.2 L * 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. They will react 1:1, so 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol OH- will react, producing 0.2 mol H2O. The remaining H
