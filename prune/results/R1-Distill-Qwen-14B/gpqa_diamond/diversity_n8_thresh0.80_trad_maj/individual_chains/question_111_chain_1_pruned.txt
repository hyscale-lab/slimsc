Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this is probably an enolate formation reaction. Oh right, this is an example of a Michael addition or maybe a conjugate addition. Wait, no, when a ketone reacts with an enolate, it's more about alkylation or acylation. Or maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol type reaction?

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, which is a good Michael donor. So, in the presence of a strong base, the enolate of the ketone would attack the acrylate. Alternatively, maybe ethyl acrylate is acting as the nucleophile here. Hmm, but wait, the starting material is a ketone, so maybe the base deprotonates it to form an enolate, which then attacks the acrylate.

But wait, cyclohexanone derivatives can form enolates. The structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one: let me draw it mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (because 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl: so at C2, two substituentsâ€”ethyl and methyl? Or is it 2-ethyl and another methyl at position 6?)

Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So position 1 is the carbonyl (O), position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl as well. So, the substituents on C2 are two methyl groups? No, wait, 2-ethyl would be a larger substituent, and 2,6-dimethyl would be two
