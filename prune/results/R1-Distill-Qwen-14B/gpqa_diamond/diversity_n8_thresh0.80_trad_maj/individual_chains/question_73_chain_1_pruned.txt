Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options are about their relative speed and the total energy. I remember that in relativity, things get a bit tricky because you can't just add velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

So for the relative speed part, I think the formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, because both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, the relative speed of B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, that's either option C or D. Hmm.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, wait, wait. No, wait, E=gamma * m c². So for the first, gamma is 1.25, and mass
