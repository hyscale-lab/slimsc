Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question starts with compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting tells us about neighboring hydrogens. A triplet usually means each of those hydrogens is next to two others. Wait, or is it the other way around? Oh right, the number of peaks usually corresponds to n+1, where n is the number of neighboring H's. So a triplet would mean each H is adjacent to two H's, like maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2.

Looking at the integrals: 6H and 4H. 6H as a tripletâ€”could that be two CH2 groups, each with three H's? Wait, no, 6H as a triplet would imply perhaps two sets of CH3 groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2CH3 scenario? Wait, let me think. A triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably a methyl group (CH3) next to another CH2. Because methyl groups are usually around 0.9. So if it's a triplet, each methyl group is adjacent to a CH2. So perhaps two methyl groups attached to a single CH2. Or wait, maybe the 6H comes from two equivalent CH3 groups. Let me think: if it's a triplet, that H is next to two Hs. So maybe the 6H is a CH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't quite add up. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted something. Like, maybe it's two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, which is then next to another CH2. Wait, but the quartet is 4H. Quartet means each H is next to three Hs. So a quartet suggests that each H is adjacent to a group with three Hs, like a CH3. So what's 4H as a quartet? Maybe a CH2 group next to a CH3. Because if a CH2 is next to a CH3, each H in the CH2 would see the three Hs of the CH3, giving a quartet. So for the quartet at 1.3 (which is a bit upfield for CH2, maybe because of being adjacent to an oxygen or something else?), that could be a CH2 connected to a CH3. So putting it together: maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CH-O-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, another approach: the integrals add up to 6 +4 =10 H. But an NMR usually integrates for all the protons in the molecule. So, maybe the molecule has 10 protons in total. So, if it's a ten-proton molecule. Hmm. Let's think about possible structures. Another thought: perhaps compound A is something like 2,2-dimethylpropanol, but no, the NMR signals don't seem to fit. Alternatively, think about diethyl ether. Wait, diethyl ether is (CH3CH2)2O. The CH3 would be a triplet, because each CH3 is next to a CH2. The CH2 adjacent to oxygen might have a quartet because each CH2 is next to another CH2. Let me check: in diethyl ether, the CH3CH2 groups would each split. The CH3 would be a triplet because each is next to the CH2 (which has 2 Hs, so n=2, triplet). The CH2O would be a quartet because each is next to the CH3 (n=3 for each H in CH2, so quartet). Wait, but in diethyl ether, the CH2 next to O is split by the adjacent CH3. So, each of the CH2 groups would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. So the NMR would show two signals: triplet for CH3 (each 3H), and quartet for CH2 (each 2H for each CH2, so two CH2 groups would give 4H total). That fits exactly with the data given: triplet at 0.9 (6H, two CH3 groups) and quartet at 1.3 (4H, two CH2 groups). So compound A is diethyl ether, (CH3CH2)2O.

So when compound A undergoes monobromination, it forms compound B. Where does bromine add in diethyl ether? Diethyl ether reacts with HBr in a substitution reaction, typically leading to an ether bromide. But wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. Monobromination could involve replacing an oxygen with Br, but that's not a typical reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where one ethyl group is replaced by Br. Wait, no, more likely, the ether undergoes an acid-catalyzed substitution where one of the ethyl groups is replaced by Br. But wait, diethyl ether is a good leaving group in some contexts. Alternatively, perhaps the monobromination is via an SN2 mechanism, but ethers are generally poor substrates for SN2 because the leaving group (like OR-) is not a great leaving group. Hmm, maybe I'm off track here.

Wait, another thought: maybe the monobromination is not on the ether oxygen but on the adjacent carbon. Oh! Wait, wait, maybe it's a bromine substitution on the ethyl group. Diethyl ether has two ethyl groups. So monobromination could be adding a Br to one of the ethyl groups. So perhaps it's an ethyl bromide derivative. But how? Let me think. Diethyl ether has the structure CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3. So if we substitute one ethyl group with Br, it would become CH3CH2-O-CH2Br? No, wait, bromine would have to replace an ethyl group. Wait, but that's not possible via typical monobromination. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution of the oxygen with Br, leading to CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3, but that doesn't sound right either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. The question says compound A undergoes monobromination to form B. What's a common way to brominate an ether? Diethyl ether is known to undergo free radical substitution when exposed to light and Br2. In that case, the hydrogen abstraction occurs, leading to bromine substitution on one of the ethyl groups. So each ethyl group has three Hs in the CH2CH3. So if one H is replaced by Br, you get ethyl bromide attached to the ether. So for example, after substitution, you would have CH3CH2-O-CH2CH2Br. Wait, no, that's substitution on the adjacent carbon. Alternatively, perhaps one of the methyl groups (CH3) becomes CH2Br. Wait, let me think: when diethyl ether is brominated via a radical mechanism, the hydrogen abstraction occurs from the ethyl group, leading to a bromine substitution at the same position. So one of the CH2CH3 groups becomes CH2CH2Br? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Diethyl ether is CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3. When brominated, each ethyl group is CH2CH3. So upon bromination, a hydrogen from one of the CH2 groups is replaced by Br, making it CH2Br. So one of the ethyl groups becomes CH2BrCH3, and the other remains CH2CH3. So compound B would be CH3CH2-O-CH2CH2Br. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, each ethyl group is CH2CH3. So when Br substitutes one H from the CH2, the group becomes CH2BrCH3. So the structure would be CH3CH2-O-CH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Because each ethyl group is CH2CH3. If one H in the CH2 is replaced by Br, it would become CH2BrCH3. So the other group would remain CH2CH3. So compound B would be CH2BrCH3-O-CH2CH3. Wait, but that's not correct because the structure would be CH3CH2-O-CH2BrCH3? No, that can't be right because that's more than one substitution. Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

Wait, diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. When monobrominated via radical substitution, one of the CH2CH3 groups becomes CH2BrCH3. So the structure of B would be CH2BrCH3-O-CH2CH3. So the molecule is CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3? No, no, the group would be CH2BrCH3 as one substituent. So the structure is (CH2BrCH3)(CH2CH3)O. Or perhaps more accurately, CH2BrCH2-O-CH2CH3? Wait, no, maybe it's CH2CH2Br-O-CH2CH3? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused
