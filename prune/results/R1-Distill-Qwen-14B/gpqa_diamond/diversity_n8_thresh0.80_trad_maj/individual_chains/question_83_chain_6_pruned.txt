Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Oh right, we have acetic acid being diluted and then titrated with NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Alright, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. And NaOH is a strong base, so it will react completely with the acid.

First, let me outline what I need to do. The initial step is probably to figure out the concentrations after dilution. The problem says 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, during titration with 0.1 M NaOH, we're looking at two points: 25% titration and equivalence point. 

Starting with the 25% titration. Wait, what's 25% of the titration? I think that means 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by the NaOH. So first, I need to find out the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

The initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles of acetic acid = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So at 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH have reacted with the acetic acid.

But wait, let me think about the titration reaction. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (a strong base) in a 1:1 ratio. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of CH3COOH, producing CH3COO^- and water. So, when 25% of the
