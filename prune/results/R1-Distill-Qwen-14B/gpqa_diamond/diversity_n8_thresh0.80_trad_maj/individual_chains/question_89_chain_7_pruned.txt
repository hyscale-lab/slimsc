Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons.

First, it's heated with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I think that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, maybe. Wait, KOH in such conditions usually leads to elimination. Since it's dibromide, perhaps it undergoes double elimination. So two E2 reactions, losing HBr twice, forming a double bond. But where?

In adamantane, the bridgehead carbons are usually not very reactive for double bonds because of the structure. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is used, perhaps it deprotonates and eliminates, forming a double bond between those two bridgeheads. That would make a diene? Or a bicyclic structure with a double bond.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Oh, and an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That IR peak is probably a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. But wait, product 1 is after the KOH reaction, which is elimination. Hmm, but if product 1's IR has a carbonyl, that suggests maybe some kind of oxidation occurred, but KOH is a base, not oxidizing. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't just elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some kind of shift. Or perhaps the product isn't just an alkene. Wait, wait a second: If you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and you treat it with KOH, perhaps you're removing both bromides. Let me think about the structure.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on bridgeheads that are three carbons apart. When treated with KOH, perhaps each bromine leaves, and the adjacent hydrogens are abstracted, leading to the formation of two double bonds? But that might not be feasible. Alternatively, perhaps each dehydrohalogenation forms a double bond, but since the structure is constrained, maybe it forms a ring.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the KOH induces a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement? Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. Wait, but an epoxide would have a different NMR signature. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But no, the IR peak suggests a carbonyl, not an alcohol or an ether.

Wait, maybe the product is an oxetane or some similar ring. Or perhaps a ketone. But how would dehydrohalogenation lead to a ketone? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination forming a conjugated diene, but then why the IR peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a step. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group. Wait, but that would be hydrolysis. Usually, that would form a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a sharp peak, maybe two hydrogens coupled to something. 4.79 is upfield for an alcohol proton, but more likely for an ether or maybe a carbonyl adjacent proton. Wait, 4.79 could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon treatment with KOH? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's some kind of elimination followed by a ring contraction or expansion, leading to a carbonyl. Maybe the elimination forms a bridge and a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the initial product is adamantane with a ketone group. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing dehydrohalogenation, losing two HBr molecules, and forming a double bond, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl in IR.

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene but another structure. Another possibility: perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of a diradical, which then forms a ketone. But that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a double elimination,
