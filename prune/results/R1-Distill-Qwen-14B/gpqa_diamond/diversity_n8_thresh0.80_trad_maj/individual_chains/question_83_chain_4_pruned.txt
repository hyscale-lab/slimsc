Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate these two pH values.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Dilution... so the initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. The initial volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, the moles of acetic acid is 0.001 as calculated earlier. So moles of NaOH needed would also be 0.001. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question asks about the pH at 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, the question says "at 25% titration" — I think that refers to 25% of the total NaOH needed to reach equivalence. So if the equivalence is 10 cm³, then 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ added. So in the solution, how does that affect the concentrations?

So for each scenario, we'll have a buffer solution because we're adding a strong base to a weak acid. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would be neutralized to acetate ions, which would form a solution of sodium acetate. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, it will hydrolyze in water to produce a basic solution.

But let me tackle each part step by step.

First, the pH at 25% titration.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let me confirm:

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 2.5 cm³ = 0.0025 L. Moles NaOH = 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

The original moles of acetic acid are 0.001. When the NaOH is added, it will react with some of the acetic acid:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So the moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025 moles, and the moles of acetate will increase by 0.00025.

So moles of CH3COOH after reaction: 0.001
