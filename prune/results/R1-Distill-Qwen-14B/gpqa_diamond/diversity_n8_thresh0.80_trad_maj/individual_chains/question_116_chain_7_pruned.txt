Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A. They give the proton NMR of A, so I need to figure out what A is. Then there's bromination, elimination, and some kind of addition reaction at the end. The options are all cyclohexenol derivatives, so the final product D must be a cyclohexene ring with some substituents and an OH group attached.

So, starting with Compound A. Its NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, the other a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means two neighboring protons, like in a -CH2CH2- group. Wait, but wait, the triplet has 6H. Let me think. Oh, maybe that's two equivalent triplets each integrating to 3H? No, wait. 6H in a triplet. So maybe a -CH2CH3 group, where each H is a triplet? Or maybe it's a (CH3)2CH group? No, wait. Let me think: if it's a triplet for 6H, perhaps that's two sets of triplets. Or maybe it's a diad, like two equivalent -CH2CH3 groups.

Wait, the other signal is a quartet (four peaks) for 4H at 1.3 ppm. Quartet suggests three neighboring Hs. For that, maybe each of the 4H is adjacent to a group with three Hs. Hmm, wait, perhaps adjacent to a CH2CH2 group? Or maybe a CH2 next to a CH3?

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl ether? No, because diethyl ether would have different splits. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a diisopropyl group? Let me think: diisopropyl ether would have (CH(CH3)2)2O. So each isopropyl group has 6 H (each CH3 group has 3 H, and there's two CH3 per isopropyl). Wait, but in that case, each isopropyl group would have 9 H in total? No, each isopropyl group is (CH3)2CH-, so each has 2*3 + 1*3=
