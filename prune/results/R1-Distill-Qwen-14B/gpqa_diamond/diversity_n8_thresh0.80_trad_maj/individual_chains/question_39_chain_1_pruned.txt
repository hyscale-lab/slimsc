Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. Alright, I've heard about normalization before. It's when the total probability of finding a particle in all space is 1, right? So the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, wait, that's a bit confusing. So the wave function ψ(x) is a function of x. Oh, right, the particle can only be found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside that region. But wait, the given ψ(x) is specified in the part where it exists. So I think the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Because usually, the wave function is either real or complex, but here it's a combination of a real term and an imaginary term. Oh, but the question says the wave function is as described "in a part of space where it can exist." So I think I can proceed by considering ψ(x) as given for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero elsewhere.

But wait a minute, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function, right? Because of the 'i' term. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, so that's fine. However, when calculating the probability density, I need to take the absolute square of the wave function. So |ψ(x)|² is what I'm after.

First, I need to normalize ψ(x). The normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1. Because the wave function is zero outside this interval.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. To find the square of the absolute value, I can write ψ(x) as a complex number A + Bi, where A is real and B is real. Then, |ψ(x)|² = A² + B².

So A is a / sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. That simplifies to (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx =1.

Wait, but can I split this integral into two parts? The integral of a²/(1+x) from 1 to 3 plus the integral of 0.25 from 1 to 3, and the sum equals 1.

Let's compute each part separately.

First integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral
