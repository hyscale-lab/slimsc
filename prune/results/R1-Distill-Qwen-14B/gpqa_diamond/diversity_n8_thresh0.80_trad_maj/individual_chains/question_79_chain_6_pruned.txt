Okay, so I'm looking at this question about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The compound X is reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Oh right, Sharpless epoxidation is for epoxidizing epoxides, specifically in allylic alcohols, but wait, no, wait—Sharpless epoxidation is for the epoxidation of epoxides in specific diols, but maybe that's not the point here. Oh wait, actually, the Sharpless epoxidation is a method to form epoxides from epoxides, but in this case, the reaction is between compound X and this reagent. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is also used in other reactions, like in some eliminations, but perhaps more importantly, if the reaction is in a nonpolar solvent at high temperature, maybe it's an epoxidation.

Wait, the product is giving certain NMR signals. Let's look at the product's NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows several signals: a singlet at δ 2.28 (3H, s), another singlet at δ 2.31 (3H, s). So two different singlets each integrating to 3H, which suggests two different methyl groups attached to something that doesn't cause splitting. Then, a doublet at 6.75 (1H, d), another at 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), and 7.71 (2H, d). So this suggests aromatic protons, perhaps with some coupling.

Looking at the 13C NMR: two quaternary carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 (each 1C, s). Then, a bunch of carbons in the aromatic region. Let's see, 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), and some others in the higher region, like 141.5 and 144.1. There's a carbonyl at 197.7 (1C, s). Wait, that's a high value, around 198. So oxygenated carbonyl, perhaps an epoxide. No, wait, 197 is more like a ketone. Hmm, but 1,4-diazabicyclo is used in epoxidation, so maybe that's an epoxide.

Wait, in epoxides, the carbons adjacent to the oxygen are typically around 60-70 ppm, but that's for the epoxide carbons themselves. The 197.7 is quite high, maybe a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. Alternatively, perhaps a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, looking at the options,
