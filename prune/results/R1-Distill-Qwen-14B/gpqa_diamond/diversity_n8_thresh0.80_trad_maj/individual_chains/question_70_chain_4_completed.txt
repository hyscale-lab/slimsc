Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about reactions and molecular symmetry. It's a bit challenging, but I'll break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again to understand each part. So, there are several reactions happening here.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents make me think of a ratio of 1:8. Maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Wait, I remember that when metals react with halogens, they can form compounds. For example, sodium (Na) reacting with chlorine (Cl2) forms NaCl. But here, the ratio is 1:8. Wait, maybe it's something like aluminum reacting with bromine? Aluminum and bromine react in a 2:3 ratio, but that's not 8. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfur reaction. Oh, wait, sulfur forms S8 molecules. So if B is O2, for example, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2, and A is something else.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like sulfur in a particular form. Or perhaps a transition metal compound. Wait, when copper reacts with chlorine, it forms CuCl2, which is blue. Maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think of another angle.

C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So maybe D is another diatomic gas. Wait, what reacts with C to make something dangerous? For example, if C is a sulfide, D might be something like oxygen or another gas. Alternatively, if C is a chloride, perhaps D is something else.

Next, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C was something like sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2), which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and HCl (strong, but wait, F and G are different). Alternatively, maybe it's another compound. Wait, if C is a compound that upon reaction with water gives two different acids. Another possibility: maybe C is a nitride? No, because that might produce NH3 and another acid. Or perhaps C is a carbonate? Wait, but if it's a carbonate, reaction with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, maybe C is an acid anhydride.

Wait, another possibility: If C is a sulfite (like SO2Cl2? No, that's a chlorosulfide). Alternatively, perhaps C is like a chlorosulfur compound. Let's think about the hydrolysis products. If we have a compound that when water is added, it produces a strong and a weak acid. For example, if C is something like (CH3)3N·HCl, but that's probably not. Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorosulfite or similar.

Wait, let's think about a possible reaction. Let's say C is SO3Cl2, which is chlorosulfuric acid. When it reacts with water, it would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and HCl (strong acid as well). But F and G are different, so that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the first reaction again. Solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of B forms C. The ratio 1:8 suggests that each A atom bonds with 8 B atoms. So, solid A is maybe a metal with a +2 charge, and B is a diatomic gas, say, O2. But 8 equivalents of O2 for each A would mean a high oxidation state. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, perhaps A is a +1 valent metal, because 8 Cl2 would mean 16 Cl per A? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is A B8. So, if A is Na, and B is Cl, NaCl8 doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about possible products. The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene (but that's COCl2), or perhaps it's another dangerous gas. Alternatively, maybe E is mustard gas or something like that.

Wait, thinking of the second reaction, if C is SO2Cl2, and D is something like F2, then E could be SO2F2, but I'm not sure if that's dangerous. Alternatively, if D is a different halogen, perhaps E is a more dangerous compound.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the third reaction. C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A, which suggests that C is a salt of A's acid. For example, if A is a metal, C could be its oxychloride, which upon hydrolysis gives back the hydroxide (A) and some acids.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (Na). Then, if B is Cl2, then the reaction could be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But the ratio here is 1:8, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, if the reaction is Na + Cl2 → NaCl + NaClO4 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur (S8), and B is something else. No, the first reaction is solid A reacting with B to form C.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find what E is, because the question is about its molecular symmetry. Let's think about the possible structures of E.

If E is a molecule with a certain symmetry, like D∞h, that's something like a linear molecule with inversion symmetry. For example, O2 or HCN, but O2 is diatomic. Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but CO2 has a linear structure with symmetry group D∞h. Alternatively, maybe E is a more complex molecule.

Wait, the options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So, the possible symmetries are either C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

If E has D∞h symmetry, that suggests a linear molecule with a center of inversion and other symmetry elements. So, maybe E is something like O2, but O2 has D∞h symmetry. Alternatively, O3 has C2v symmetry, I think.

Wait, what about SO2? No, SO2 is bent, with symmetry group D2h or C2v. Wait, SO2 has a bent structure, with a V shape, so its symmetry group would be C2v because it has a two-fold axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a mirror plane.

Wait, another thought: If E is a molecule like phosgene (COCl2), which is a planar molecule with a central carbon, it has a certain symmetry. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. Its structure is trigonal planar around the carbon, with two Cl atoms and two O atoms. The symmetry group here is D∞h? No, wait. Let me think: in COCl2, the molecule is planar, with a central C connected to O and two Cl. The molecule has a mirror plane through the C-O bond, and a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the plane. So, the symmetry group is D2h or C2v? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty.

Wait, no, for phosgene (COCl2), the molecule has a point group of D∞h? Or maybe it's D2h. Alternatively, perhaps it's C2v. Let me think again. The molecule has a central C with four substituents: O and two Cl, but wait, COCl2 is O=C(Cl)2. So the molecule is planar with a C=O double bond. The structure is trigonal planar, with a central C, and two Cl atoms attached. The molecule has a mirror plane along the C-O axis, and a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the molecule. So, the symmetry includes a C2 axis, a mirror plane, and an inversion center. That would make the symmetry group D∞h? Or maybe D2h.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has D2h symmetry. D2h has a four-fold inversion, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like O3, which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry.

Wait, let's think about each option. The question is, what is the molecular symmetry group of E?

If E has D∞h symmetry, that would mean it's a linear molecule with a center of inversion and other symmetry elements. So, if E is something like O2 or HCN, then D∞h applies. But O2 is diatomic, with each atom the same, so its symmetry is D∞h. However, if E is O3, then it's a nonlinear molecule with a bent structure, so its symmetry would be lower.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent, its symmetry group is D2h or C2v. Wait, SO2 is a bent molecule with a central S and two O atoms. It has a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, and two mirror planes. So the symmetry group is D2h. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the problem again. Let's try to piece together the reactions.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). So A is a solid, B is a gas, C is bright red.

Second reaction: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous).

Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G weak acid).

Fourth reaction: D + B → H (solvent), in a 1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Let's try to think about each substance. Let's see.

In the fourth reaction, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D and B are gases, and H is a liquid or a solvent. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, but H2O is a liquid. Alternatively, B is F2 and D is H2O → but H2O is already a solvent.

Wait, another example: If B is O2 and D is H2, they react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. But the ratio here is 1:1. So maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2? That would form HCl, which is a gas, but HCl is not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is Cl2, but they react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl, but that's a gas. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the reaction is B + D → H. If B is O2 and D is H2, they react in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. But the given ratio is 1:1, so maybe it's another reaction. Maybe B is F2 and D is H2O. But F2 is a gas, and H2O is a liquid, but F2 + H2O → would produce O2, HF, and possibly other products. Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: B is H2O (but that's a liquid), but the question says B is a gas. So B can't be H2O.

Hmm. Maybe B is O2 and D is H2. So O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But again, the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: H is a solvent, so perhaps H is something like ethanol, water, or another common solvent. But since H is formed by B and D, both gases, perhaps H is H2O? Because B and D are gases reacting to form H2O, which is a liquid (solvent). But then the reaction would be B (gas) + D (gas) → H2O (liquid). So what gases B and D could react to form H2O?

Possible reactions: 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. That's a 2:1 ratio. But the problem states a 1:1 ratio. Hmm. Maybe another reaction, like 2 F2 + 2 H2O → O2 + 4 HF. But that's not a 1:1 ratio either.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2.  H2 and Cl2 react in a 1:1 ratio upon light to form 2 HCl. But that's a gas, not a solvent. So perhaps H is HCl, but that's a gas, not a liquid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it yields a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a chlorosulfate, maybe when it reacts with water, it produces HCl (strong) and H2SO4 (strong), but they are both strong, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitro compound.

Wait, another possibility: C is a salt. For instance, if C is NaHSO4, when it reacts with water, it would produce NaOH (strong base?), but that's not fitting. Alternatively, maybe C is an acid chloride. For example, if C is SOCl2, then reacting with water would produce HCl (strong acid) and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, I think). Wait, H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, which is a weak acid. So in that case, C would be SOCl2. Let me see.

If C is SOCl2, then when it reacts with water:

SOCl2 + H2O → H2SO3 (sulfurous acid) + 2 HCl (hydrochloric acid).

So F and G would be HCl (strong) and H2SO3 (weak). That fits the description. So C could be SOCl2.

Now, let's go back to the first reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). If C is SOCl2, which is a pale yellow liquid, not bright red. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe C is something else.

Wait, another possibility: C is SO2Cl2. Sulfuryl chloride is bright yellow, I think. But the reaction product is bright red. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe C is a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is an organic compound, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: What if C is a metal chloride? For example, if A is Fe, B is Cl2. But Fe reacts with Cl2 in a 2:3 ratio, not 1:8. So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps A is sulfur (S8), and B is something else. S reacting with a gas. Hmm, when sulfur is burned in excess oxygen, it forms SO2 (which is colorless, not bright red). Alternatively, if it's a different reaction. Wait, maybe B is O3 (ozone), but O3 is a gas. Sulfur and ozone reaction? Not sure.

Wait, maybe C is SO3, which is a colorless liquid. No, not bright red.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of each step.

If C is SOCl2, then in the first reaction, A would have to react with B to form SOCl2. What reacts to form SOCl2? Well, SOCl2 is made by reacting sulfuric acid with thionyl chloride (but that's a different reaction). Alternatively, perhaps A is S and B is Cl2. Let's see:

S (solid) + Cl2 (gas) → SOCl2? But the reaction would produce SOCl2? Let's check the stoichiometry. The reaction between S and Cl2 is usually:

S + Cl2 → SOCl2? No, I think the reaction is more likely to produce SO2 or other compounds. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Na, B is Cl2. Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But the stoichiometry is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 1 mole of Cl2 reacts with 2 moles of Na. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B, which would be Cl2. So 8 moles of Cl2 would react with 16 moles of A (if A is Na, which has a +1 charge per atom). But that would lead to NaCl, but the product would be 16 NaCl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal with a higher charge, like Ca. Ca (solid) + Cl2 (gas) → CaCl2. The ratio would be 2 moles of Cl2 per mole of Ca. So 1 mole Ca reacts with 1 mole Cl2. But the problem has 8 equivalents of B, which would be 8 moles Cl2 per 1 mole A. So A would need to have a charge that allows 8 Cl per A. For example, if A is Na (charge +1), then 8 Cl atoms would imply 8 moles Cl2 (since each Cl2 gives 2 Cl-). So for 1 mole Na, 8 moles Cl2 would produce 8 NaCl. But that would require 8 equivalents of Cl2. So the reaction would be Na + 8 Cl2 → 8 NaCl. But is that possible? Hmm, I'm not sure.

But then, C would be NaCl. Then, in the second reaction, C (NaCl) reacts with D (unknown gas) to form E (extremely hazardous). What reacts with NaCl to form a dangerous product? Maybe D is H2SO4, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, D could be H2S, but that's a gas. NaCl + H2S → no reaction at room temperature. Alternatively, maybe D is a strong base, like NH3, but that's a gas. NaCl + NH3 → no reaction. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 again. Then, NaCl + Cl2 → NaClO3 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about the third reaction again. C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). If C is SOCl2, then A would be S, and the acids would be HCl (strong) and H2SO3 (weak). So A would be S. So in the first reaction, S reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form SOCl2.

But what is B in this case? Let's see. If B is Cl2, then the reaction would be:

S (solid) + Cl2 (gas) → SOCl2 (liquid?)

Wait, but the reaction between sulfur and chlorine is more likely to produce SO2 and Cl2, but perhaps under certain conditions, it could produce SOCl2. Alternatively, perhaps B is another gas.

Wait, maybe B is SO2. Then, the reaction would be S + SO2 → something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a halogen, but I'm not making progress.

Let me try to approach this differently. Let's think about E. It's extremely hazardous. What molecules are extremely hazardous? Phosgene (COCl2) is very toxic. Mustard gas (but that's a sulfur-based compound). Sarin gas is a nerve agent, but I don't know its structure well. Alternatively, maybe E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorodinitrogen tetraoxide?), but not sure.

Wait, another thought: if E is phosgene (COCl2), then its structure is O=C(Cl)2. The molecule is trigonal planar around the C, with a double bond to O and single bonds to two Cl. The symmetry group for COCl2 is D∞h? No, wait. COCl2 has a central C with two Cl and an O. The molecule has a mirror plane along the C=O axis and a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane. Thus, the symmetry group is D2h.

Wait, but D2h has certain symmetry elements. Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry is C2v, because there's a C2 axis and a mirror plane. Hmm.

Alternatively, if E is O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule, its symmetry group is C2v. O3 has a central O with two other O atoms attached. It has a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a mirror plane, so the symmetry group is C2v.

Wait, but how would that fit into the reactions?

If E is O3, then the second reaction would be C + 2 D → O3.

But I'm not sure what C and D would be in that case.

This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should try to map out each compound.

Assuming C is SOCl2, as in the third reaction:

C (SOCl2) + H2O → S (A) + HCl (F) + H2SO3 (G).

So A is S, F is HCl (strong acid), G is H2SO3 (weak acid).

Then, in the first reaction, S reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form SOCl2.

What reacts with S to form SOCl2? Well, SOCl2 is made by the reaction between SO2 and Cl2 in the presence of a catalyst. But that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, S can be reacted with Cl2 under certain conditions. Let me check: The reaction between sulfur and chlorine gas. S + Cl2 → SOCl2? Not sure. Maybe under specific conditions, but I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2, and the reaction is S + Cl2 → SOCl2. But how many equivalents?

The formula for SOCl2 has one S and two Cl atoms. So for each mole of S, we need two moles of Cl2, because each Cl2 provides two Cl atoms. So the reaction would be S + 2 Cl2 → SOCl2.

But the problem states that in the first reaction, 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) are used per mole of A (S). So that would imply 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of S. Which would produce 8 SOCl2 molecules? That can't be right because each SOCl2 requires only 2 Cl2 per S.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think: S (1 mole) reacts with x moles of Cl2 to produce y moles of SOCl2.

Each SOCl2 requires 1 S and 2 Cl2.

So 1 mole S → 1 mole SOCl2 → 2 moles Cl2 consumed.

So the ratio is 1:2 for S:Cl2.

But the problem states 8 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of S. So that's 8 moles Cl2 per mole S.

Which would produce 4 moles of SOCl2, because each SOCl2 needs 2 moles Cl2.

So the reaction would be S + 8 Cl2 → 4 SOCl2.

Is that a possible reaction? I'm not sure, but perhaps it's for a different compound.

Alternatively, maybe the product is something else. Maybe C is something else, like SCl, but I think SCl is not a known compound.

Alternatively, perhaps C is S2Cl2. Let me think: S2Cl2 is a red liquid, I believe. So if C is S2Cl2, which is bright red, that would fit the first part.

Then, the first reaction would be S (solid) + Cl2 (gas) → S2Cl2 (bright red), with a stoichiometry of 1 S : 2 Cl2.

But the problem states 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) per mole of A (S). So 1 S reacts with 8 Cl2. That would produce 4 S2Cl2 molecules, because each S2Cl2 needs 2 Cl2 per S.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate:

Each mole of S2Cl2 requires 2 moles of Cl2 (since each Cl2 is diatomic, so 2 moles of Cl per S2Cl2). So for 4 moles of S2Cl2, you need 4 * 2 = 8 moles of Cl2, and 2 moles of S.

Wait, but the stoichiometry would be 2 S + 8 Cl2 → 4 S2Cl2.

But the problem says 1 mole of A (S) reacts with 8 moles of B (Cl2). So that would require 4 moles of S2Cl2, but that would need 2 moles of S. Hmm, that doesn't fit because the problem says 1 mole of A.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a different compound.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry of E.

If E is phosgene (COCl2), then what is its point group?

Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. The molecule is planar with a C=O double bond and two Cl atoms. The symmetry group is D2h because it has a mirror plane along the C=O axis, a C2 axis perpendicular to the molecular plane, and inversion centers. So the symmetry group is D2h.

Wait, but D2h is option B, which is D4h. No, wait, the options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

So if E is phosgene, D2h symmetry is not an option. Hmm. So maybe E has a different structure.

Alternatively, if E is O3, which is a bent molecule, its symmetry group is C2v (option D). So that would fit if E is O3.

But let's see. How would the reactions lead to O3?

In the second reaction, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E (O3). What would C and D be?

If C is SOCl2, then reacting with D (maybe O2?) to form O3? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated oxygen compound. Hmm.

Another approach: let's look at the fourth reaction. D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

If D is H2O and B is a gas, but H2O is a liquid, not a gas. Alternatively, B is H2O but that's a liquid. So perhaps B is another gas, and D is something else.

Wait, another thought: if D is H2O (liquid or gas?) and B is F2, then F2 + H2O → O2 + 2 HF. But that's a 1:1 ratio of F2 to H2O, producing O2 and HF. Wait, but O2 is a gas, HF is a gas or liquid. So H would be O2, which is a gas, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is HCl. NH3 (gas) + HCl (gas) → NH4Cl (solid), but that's not a solvent. Or maybe D is CO2 and B is something else.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Maybe I should think about the possible symmetry groups.

If E is O3, point group is C2v (option D). If E is COCl2, point group is D2h, which is not an option. If E is SO2, point group is D2h or C2v. Alternatively, if E is O2, point group D∞h (option C).

But O2 is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. If E is O2, then the reaction would be C + 2 D → O2. What would that imply?

But O2 is a gas, and the product is extremely hazardous. O2 itself is not extremely hazardous, but maybe in a different form.

Alternatively, E could be Cl2O, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is ClF3, but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Another thought: what if E is phosgene (COCl2), which has D∞h symmetry? But earlier I thought it has D2h. Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about that.

Wait, the point group for COCl2. Let me visualize the structure. The central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar. There is a C2 axis perpendicular to the plane (since you can rotate 180 degrees and the molecule looks the same). There are mirror planes: one along the C=O axis, and another one bisecting the two Cl atoms. So the molecule has a C2 axis, a mirror plane, and an inversion center. So the symmetry group is D2h.

But D2h is not one of the options. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about the symmetry of COCl2. Another way to think: D∞h requires an infinite number of symmetry planes, which is the case for linear molecules like HCN or CO2. COCl2 is not linear; it's trigonal planar. So it can't have D∞h symmetry.

Hmm. Another possibility: E has D4h symmetry. D4h is a higher symmetry group, which includes a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. So, which molecules have D4h symmetry? Perhaps something like XeF4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think of E as having D∞h symmetry. That would mean a linear molecule with multiple symmetry planes. So, O2 is a diatomic with D∞h symmetry. So if E is O2, then the symmetry is D∞h (option C). But would that fit the reactions?

If E is O2, then in the second reaction, C reacts with 2 D to form O2. What would C and D be?

But O2 is a diatomic molecule, which is a gas. So if the reaction produces O2, which is a gas, but the reaction is C + 2 D → O2. If O2 is a product, perhaps C is an oxide and D is a reducing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide, and D is something else. Not sure.

But this line of thinking isn't leading me anywhere quickly. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Since the options include D∞h (option C), which is the symmetry of O2, I'll consider E as O2. But the problem states E is extremely hazardous. O2 is not extremely hazardous on its own, but perhaps in a different form.

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2O7, which is a highly reactive and dangerous compound. Cl2O7 has a structure that is Cl-O-Cl with four O atoms. Wait, no, Cl2O7 is Cl-O-Cl with other oxygens. Its structure is a linear chain, but I'm not certain about its symmetry group.

Wait, another thought: if E is Cl2O, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is trigonal planar, so symmetry group D2h, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if E is something like SO2, which is a bent molecule, its symmetry group is D2h or C2v. Wait, SO2 has a structure similar to O3, so perhaps it's C2v (option D).

If E is SO2, what would the reactions look like?

In the second reaction, C reacts with 2 D → SO2. So C and D would need to combine to form SO2.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: perhaps E is a molecule with D4h symmetry, which would be option B.

D4h symmetry implies a molecule with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. For example, molecules like [PtCl4]^2- have D4h symmetry, but E is a product of reactions, so perhaps it's a coordination compound. But E is a product of C and D reacting, with D being a gas.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is D∞h (option C), as O2 has that symmetry and is a possible product.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The ratio of 1:8 suggests a compound where one atom of A bonds with eight atoms of B. This could imply a high oxidation state or a specific stoichiometric relationship. The bright red color of C suggests it might be a sulfur-containing compound or a halogenated derivative.

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E. The symmetry of E depends on its molecular structure. E is described as extremely hazardous, which narrows it down to compounds like phosgene (COCl₂), ozone (O₃), or oxygen (O₂).

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests C is likely a salt or acid derivative that hydrolyzes to yield these acids. For example, if C is SOCl₂, hydrolysis would produce HCl (strong acid) and H₂SO₃ (weak acid).

4. **Fourth Reaction**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. This implies D and B are gases that react to form a liquid or another solvent. For example, if B is Cl₂ and D is H₂O, they could form HCl and HOCl, but this does not align perfectly with the given ratio.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**:
   - If E is phosgene (COCl₂), its structure is trigonal planar with a central carbon atom double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its symmetry group is **D₂h**, but this is not one of the options.
   - If E is ozone (O₃), it is a bent molecule with a central oxygen atom and two outer oxygen atoms. Its symmetry group is **C₂v**, which matches option D.
   - If E is oxygen (O₂), it is a diatomic molecule with linear symmetry. Its symmetry group is **D∞h**, which matches option C.
   - If E is a molecule like CO₂, it is linear with symmetry group **D∞h**, but this does not align with the reactions described.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the symmetry options provided, the most plausible symmetry group for E is **D∞h**, consistent with oxygen (O₂), a linear molecule with high symmetry.
