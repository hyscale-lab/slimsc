Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's assign the positions. Well, in benzene, numbering starts such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So if I have substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3, the numbering goes in a way that they are adjacent or neighboring. Wait, but the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 are all adjacent in a meta arrangement? Or maybe it's a para arrangement? Wait, no, because position 1 and 2 are adjacent (ortho), position 2 and 3 are adjacent (ortho), but position 1 and 3 are meta. Hmm.

Wait, correct structure: the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So the ring has substituents in the 1, 2, 3 positions, which are all adjacent in a way that they form a sort of trio around the ring.

Now, the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene. The options give different sequences, so I need to find the correct order of reactions.

Let me think about the substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. These are all strong activating or deactivating groups. Nitro is a strong meta-directing group, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group, and tert-butyl is a bulky activating group (since it's an alkyl group, which is activating and ortho/para-directing, but being bulky, it may direct more towards para).

Wait, but wait, the order of reactions will determine where each substituent gets added. Since directing effects depend on the existing substituents, the sequence is crucial.

Let me outline the target molecule again. The substituents are at positions 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So, in the benzene ring, ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, tert-butyl at 2. So, when we add these groups, each new substituent must be added at the correct position based on the current directing groups.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So, if I add nitro after ethoxy, where would it go? Let's think step by step.

Possible approach:

1. Add ethoxy group first. But wait, benzene doesn't have any substituents, so any electrophilic substitution would add ethoxy at any position, but perhaps we need to choose which group to add first to control the orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl is added first, then nitro, then ethoxy. Or maybe nitro first, then tert-butyl, then ethoxy.

Wait, but let's think about the possible steps.

Possible reactions involved include:

- Friedel-Crafts alkylation (for tert-butyl group)
- Nitration (adding nitro)
- Ethoxylation, which is typically done via the ethoxylation, perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution after making a good leaving group, like using a Williamson ether synthesis. But for benzene, ethoxy group is usually introduced via an electrophilic substitution, like reacting with ethyl nitrate or using a substitution after sulfonation. Or perhaps using a nitration followed by something else.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added via an alkylation, but wait, alkylation usually refers to adding alkyl groups, not ethers. So perhaps the ethoxy can come from a nucleophilic substitution on a sulfonated benzene ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to plan the steps.

The target has three substituents. Let's think about the order in which they are added.

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But adding the ethoxy last may have issues because nitro is a strong meta director, and tert-butyl is ortho/para. Wait, but if the nitro is already present, where would the ethoxy go? Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Wait, but ethoxy is an activating group. So after adding ethoxy, when adding another substituent, where would it go?

Wait, benzene rings can undergo multiple substitutions, and each subsequent substitution depends on the existing groups.

Let me think about each substituent's effect.

Ethoxy group (-OEt) is an activating group, ortho/para-directing.

Nitro group (-NO2) is deactivating, meta-directing.

tert-butyl group is an activating, bulky group, so it is ortho/para-directing but tends to add more to
