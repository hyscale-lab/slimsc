Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions and ion concentrations can get a bit tricky. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-). The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, it forms a buffer solution. In this case, I think KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion) and Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2HPO4·2H2O. Wait, no, the formula is Na2HPO4 with two waters of crystallization. But when dissolved, Na2HPO4 (the actual anion is HPO4^2-) would dissociate into Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, looking at the components:
- KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
- Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

The H2PO4^- is the conjugate acid (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So this is a buffer system involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The phosphate system has multiple dissociation steps. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+.

So the buffer is between H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). The relevant Ka here is the second one, Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. Because in the buffer equation, the concentration ratio of the conjugate base to acid is related to the Ka.

So the formula for the buffer is:

Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA]

Where HA is H2PO4^- and A- is HPO4^2-.

But wait, we are asked for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Hmm, that's a different ion. So I need to think about how PO4^3- comes into play. Let me think.

Wait, the phosphate ions in solution are in different forms. At pH around the pKa2 (which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.2), the predominant species would be HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But PO4^3- is much less because it's the third dissociation, and the third Ka is very small (1.8e-12). So under normal circumstances, without a strong base, the concentration of PO4^
