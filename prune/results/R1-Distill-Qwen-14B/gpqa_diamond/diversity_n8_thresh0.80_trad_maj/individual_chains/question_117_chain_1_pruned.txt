Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about isomerism, specifically optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think through it step by step.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, labeled 1 to 4. I need to figure out which compounds have the possibility of optical isomers.

First, what's optical isomerism? From what I remember, it's a type of stereoisomerism where compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These are also called enantiomers. For a compound to exhibit optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Or wait, are there other possibilities too, like allenes or compounds with planes of symmetry? Hmm, maybe I should focus on chiral centers first since that's the most common case.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings. So, the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6 on each ring, and another substituent is the dimethyl dicarboxylate at position 2 on each ring. Wait, but in the biphenyl structure, the substituents are on each ring. Do they lead to a chiral center?

Wait, the central structure is a single bond between the two benzene rings. If the substituents are arranged in such a way that the two rings are not symmetrical, could that create a chiral center elsewhere? Or maybe the substituents themselves cause some kind of asymmetry in the molecule.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's think about the substituents. On each ring, at position 2, there's a carbonyl group attached to an OMe (since it's the dicarboxylate ester, so each would be OMe). So each ring has two substituents: a nitro group at 6 and a carbonyl-O-Me group at 2.

Wait, but the biphenyl itself is connected at position 1, so each ring is attached via a single bond. Now, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then maybe there's a possibility of the biphenyl having a chiral axis or something. But biphenyls usually rotate around the single bond, unless hindered. Wait, but if the substituents are in such positions that the two rings are not mirror images, then maybe the molecule can have enantiomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule itself isn't chiral, but upon substituent arrangement, could it have a chiral center elsewhere? Maybe the central carbon isn't a carbon but a bond between two aromatic rings. Wait, so if each ring has the same substituents, but arranged in a way that the whole molecule isn't symmetrical, perhaps that leads to the possibility of optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe it's the presence of multiple substituents on the biphenyl that creates a chiral center when considering the entire structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that would prevent it from being chiral. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically on each ring, then the molecule would be achiral. But in this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a substituent at 2. Wait, but 6 is opposite to the connecting point (position 1?), so maybe the two substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize. Each benzene ring is attached at position 1 to the other ring. On position 2 of each ring, there's a -COOCH3 group, and on position 6, a nitro group. So for each ring, substituents are in positions 2 and 6. Now, position 2 is next to the connecting point (position 1), and position 6 is across from that. So for each ring, substituents are in positions 2 and 6. If both rings have the same substituents, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but in a 1,1'-biphenyl, each ring is attached at position 1. So if both rings have substituents at positions 2 and 6, it would make the molecule symmetrical. Because each ring's substituents are mirrored in the other. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. Therefore, this compound might not exhibit optical isomerism.
