Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The key points are:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

The question is asking for the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, okay, so first I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let me break down each reaction.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Since B is a gas and is reacting with A, which is a solid, perhaps B is a diatomic gas like O2, Cl2, or maybe something else. The stoichiometry is 8 equivalents, which is a lot. So maybe B is O2. If A is, say, a metal, then reacting with O2 might form an oxide. But wait, for 8 equivalents, maybe it's like 8 O atoms? If A is sodium (Na), then Na + O2 → Na2O2? Wait, sodium peroxide. But sodium peroxide is a solid, right? And sodium peroxide is bright yellow, not red. Hmm. Maybe another metal or another compound.

Alternatively, could A be sulfur? Sulfur reacting with O2 forms SO3? No, that would be more like 3 O2 per S. Wait, but the product C is bright red. Red solids are not that common. Maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: when something is bright red, maybe it's a transition metal complex, like a chromium or iron compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, I think. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but not bright red. Wait, maybe not metal oxides. Another possibility is that C is a compound with a metal and another element.

Wait, moving to the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Strong acids like H2SO4, HCl; weak ones like H2CO3, HNO2, etc.

So if C is a metal peroxide, say NaO2 or something else, but NaO2 isn't a thing. Wait, maybe C is something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that upon hydrolysis produces both acids. Wait, but metal oxides typically produce just one acid. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: if C is a salt that can undergo hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is a nitride? Like Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, so maybe that's not fitting. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide? But sulfides when hydrolyzed produce H2S (a weak acid, but H2S is a weak acid), but wait, that's if it's a metal sulfide. Wait, but if C is a sulfide, then reacting with water would produce the corresponding metal hydroxide and H2S. But the problem says two different acids, so that doesn't fit.

Another possibility is that C is a salt of a strong acid and weak base, which upon hydrolysis would produce a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. Wait, for example, sodium peroxide (Na2O2) reacts with water to produce NaOH (strong base) and H2
