Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like and detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because Kepler's third law says the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, but since the mass of the star is different, the period and semi-major axis are related.

The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Both stars have the same radius, though. Interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, the radius is the same, maybe because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but with similar radius.

I think the transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (m_planet/m_star)^(1/3))) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) divided by (something involving the star's mass and the planet's orbital distance), but perhaps more accurately, the probability of transit is approximately (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_planet)/(R_*) ), but since the planets' sizes are similar, maybe we can ignore the planet radius compared to the star.

Wait, no, the exact formula for the transit probability. Let me think. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The chance that the planet's orbital plane is such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_*/a) * (1 + (R_planet/R_*)), but since Earth-like planets are much smaller than stars, R_planet is negligible. So P â‰ˆ (R_*/a) times (1/(1 + (m_p/(M_*))^(1/3)) ))? Wait, no, that sounds off. Alternatively, maybe the transit probability is more accurately given by (R_*/a) multiplied by (1 / sin i), where i is the inclination, but since we don't know the
