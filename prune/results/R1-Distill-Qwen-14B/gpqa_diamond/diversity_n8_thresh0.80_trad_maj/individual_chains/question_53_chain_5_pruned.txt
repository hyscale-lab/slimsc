Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there are ester functionalities present. The 1H NMR has six signals. Let me break down the NMR information.

So, the NMR has:
- Two signals for aromatic protons. Wait, a di-substituted benzene usually has two sets of aromatic protons if the substituents are in a para arrangement, maybe. Because, in para substitution, you get two equivalent protons on each adjacent position, leading to two signals. Or wait, if it's ortho or meta? Hmm. Wait, no, a di-substituted benzene with substituents in para positions would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, two doublets or something like that.

- Then two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are like CH₂=CH–, so each proton on the double bond would split into certain patterns. A doublet could be if the protons are adjacent to each other, maybe in a trans configuration. But a doublet of quartets is a bit more complex. Maybe they're coupling with two different sets of protons. Or perhaps each is coupling with two equivalent protons, leading to two doublets. Hmm, not entirely sure yet.

- Two signals for –CH3 groups. So that's two different methyl groups. And importantly, no –CH2 signals. So the compound doesn't have any methylene groups (CH₂). That's a key point.

The options are four different molecular formulas: C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

I need to find out which one fits the given data.

Let me think about the structure. It's a di-substituted aromatic ring, and there's an ester group. So maybe it's an ester like something benzene with an ester substituent. But wait, the ester group itself is OCOOR, so that would have an oxygen and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the molecule is di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. One of them is an ester, maybe, and the other could be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is part of a larger structure, like an ortho ester or something else.

Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula would help determine that. The molecular formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So:

For C11H12O2:
DoU = (2*11 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 DoU: which could be a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus an ester group (which has a double bond in the carbonyl and an ether linkage, but wait, ester is OCOOR, so it has two double bonds: the carbonyl and the ether? No, wait, the ester is O-CO-O-R. So the carbonyl is a double bond. So an ester contributes one DoU. So benzene (3) + ester (1) = 4. The remaining two DoUs could be a double bond or a ring. Wait, but let's think of the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a ring. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the compound has a benzene ring with substituents, one of which is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR says two vinyl-H signals. So perhaps there's a vinyl group attached to the benzene ring. Like a substituent that is an ester linked to a vinyl group.

Wait, let me think about the structure. If the benzene is di-substituted, one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR), and the other substituent is a vinyl group (like CH₂CH₂–, but that's a single bond. Or maybe a vinyl group as in CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. That would make it a styrene-type structure.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. Let me think. A vinyl group like CH₂=CH– has two sets of protons. In a trans configuration, the two Hs would be on opposite sides, but in a cis, they're on the same side. But in any case, each H would couple with the other. So you might get a doublet for each, but perhaps if there's another coupling, like with adjacent groups.

Wait, the problem says one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm. That suggests that one proton is coupling with one other proton (giving a doublet), and the other is coupling with two other sets of protons, perhaps. Or maybe each is coupling with two protons elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of an ester substituent. For example, maybe the ester is something like OCOOR where R is a vinyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is OCOCH₂CH₂–, but no, that would be an ethyl ester, not a vinyl.

Wait, maybe it's a vinyl ester, like OCOCH=CH₂. Then the vinyl group would have two protons, each with their own signals.

In that case, the two vinyl protons would split into specific patterns. Let's see: the structure would be benzene-O-CO-O-CH₂CH₂? No, wait, that would be an ether. Wait, no, the
