Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question is about chemical reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of a product E. The options are A to D with various symmetry groups. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes and structures of molecules, like in VSEPR theory or crystal field theory.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I'm thinking maybe A is something like sulfur, and B is something else. Oh wait, bright red product Câ€”could that be something like sulfur trioxide? No, wait. Or maybe it's another compound. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium, and B is chlorine? Let's see. 8 equivalents means a 1:8 ratio. So if A is Na (solid) and B is Cl2 (gas), 8 moles would give 4 moles of NaCl. But that's a white solid, not red. Hmm, maybe not.

Another thought: If A is aluminum and B is something like sulfur. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is sulfur and B is something else. Wait, another thought: maybe product C is SO3, sulfur trioxide. Because in the third reaction, C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids. If C is SO3, then reacting with water would give H2SO4 and another acid? Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, and what else? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, if C is Na2O2, but
