Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But wait, the mass might not play a direct role here since the question is about elemental abundances. Hmm, maybe mass isn't directly needed for this calculation.

The question gives a bunch of abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. Oh right, the notation [X/Y] means log (n_X / n_Y) - log (n_X/n_Y)_sun. So the abundance is relative to the Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex. So for Star_2, the ratio of Mg to Si is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. 

Wait, and then [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex, meaning Star_1's iron abundance is the same as the Sun's. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Star_2's magnesium is same as the Sun's as well.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given with 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. Let me think: that must be the solar value for [Fe/H]. Wait, because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. Wait, but in the notation, [X/H] is log (n_X/n_H) - log (n_X/n_H)_sun. So if [Fe/H]_sun is zero, because [Fe/H] is measured relative to H.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero, right? Because [Fe/H] is defined as log (nFe/nH) - log (nFe/nH)_sun. So when [Fe/H] is zero, it's the solar value.

Wait, but the given data for the Sun is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So 12 + log (nFe/nH)_sun =7.5. So log (nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So that's about 3.16e-5. Because 10^(-4.5) is about 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log (nMg/nH)_sun is 7 -12 = -5, which is 10^-5, which is 1e-5.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to use these numbers. The problem is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2.

So, the ratio is n_Si,1 / n_Si,2.

To find this ratio, I think I need to find [Si/H] for each star and then take their ratio.

Wait, because [Si/H] gives the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen. So if I have [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then the ratio would be (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) / (n_Si,2 / n_H,2). But since we're dealing with the ratio of silicon atoms, perhaps n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = (n_Si,1 / n_H,1) * (n_H,2 / n_Si,2) ) / (n_H,1 / n_H,2) ). Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps assuming that the hydrogen is the same in both stars relative to themselves? Wait, but H may not be the same.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] and use the given data to find [Si/H] for each star.

Let me think about Star_1 first. For Star_1:

Given [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Which means (n_Si / n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

And [Fe/H]_1 =0, meaning (n_Fe / n_H)_1 = (n_Fe / n_H)_sun.

So, (n_Fe)_1 = (n_Fe)_sun * (n_H)_1 / (n_H)_sun.

Similarly, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun. So n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,1.

But how does that help me find n_Si,1?

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. So n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun).

So n_Si,1 = n_Fe,1 * 10^0.3 * (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun).

But n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,1.

So substituting, n_Si,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun ) * n_H,1 * 10^0.3 * (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun).

Simplify: n_Si,1 = n_H,1 * (n_Fe,sun ) * 10^0.3 * (n_Si,sun / (n_H,sun * n_Fe,sun ) ) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me write the expressions step by step.

For Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_1 - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

So n_Si,1 / n_Fe,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si,sun / n_Fe,sun).

And [Fe/H]_1 =0, so log(n_Fe/n_H)_1 = 0. Hence, n_Fe,1 / n_H,1 = n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun.

So, n_Fe,1 = (n_Fe,sun / n_H,sun)
