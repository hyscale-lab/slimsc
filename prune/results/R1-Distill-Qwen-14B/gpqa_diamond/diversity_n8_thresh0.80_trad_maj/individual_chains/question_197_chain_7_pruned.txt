Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Once I know that, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates the presence of an -OH group or possibly an amine. But since there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be C=C aromatic ring vibrations or conjugated carbonyl groups.

Now the NMR data: Let's break it down.

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is likely an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. But the broadness makes me think it's more like an -OH, maybe from a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet in the aromatic region. This suggests two protons that are adjacent or in a para-substituted benzene ring.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, probably the other two protons in the aromatic ring. So maybe a para-substituted benzene, like a para-substituted benzoic acid? Because the two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest a para-di-substituted ring.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet around 3 ppm. This could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Maybe a CH next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet, maybe some CH2 groups, perhaps part of an ethyl chain or a substituent on the aromatic ring.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons as a doublet. Wait, a doublet with 3H? That usually indicates a CH3 group attached to a CH. Like maybe a branching point. For example, in an isobutyl group: the CH3 would be split into a doublet if the adjacent CH has two protons, but wait no, in isobutyl, the CH would have two CH2 groups, but perhaps in a different structure.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, probably a terminal CH3 in an ethyl chain. So maybe an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Putting this together: The aromatic ring is para-substit
