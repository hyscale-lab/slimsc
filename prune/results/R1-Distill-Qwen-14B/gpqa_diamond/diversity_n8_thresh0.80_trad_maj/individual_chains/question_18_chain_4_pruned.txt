Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant, but I'll keep it in mind just in case.

The problem gives some abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. Let's list out the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The indices after the elements are the star numbers, right? So Star_1's [Si/Fe] is 0.3 and [Fe/H] is 0. And Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3 and [Mg/H] is 0.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, what does that mean? So the number density of Fe relative to H in the Sun is 10^(-4.5), and Mg is 10^(-5).

But the question is about the ratio of silicon in the two stars. I need to find [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2], I think.

Wait, no. The ratio is (nSi1 / nSi2), or (nSi in Star_1)/(nSi in Star_2). Or wait, maybe the ratio [Si/Fe] for
