Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. 

The reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, which is written as Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. The rest masses are provided: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². I remember that neutrinos are super light, almost massless, so their rest mass can be considered zero. 

Wait, but wait. I think in particle physics, when a particle decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So the muon and the neutrino will have opposite momenta. 

The question is about the kinetic energy of each product. Hmm, I think I should calculate the total energy available first. The rest mass of the pion is the total energy available because it's at rest. So the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon has a rest mass, so its energy will be its rest energy plus kinetic energy, while the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible). 

So, the total energy before decay is the rest mass of the pion: 139.6 MeV. After decay, the muon has energy E_mu and the neutrino has energy E_nu. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Now, considering conservation of momentum. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay must be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

The energy of each particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu = p_nu c. Similarly, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). 

But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), because they are opposite, their momenta are equal. Let's denote p as the magnitude of each momentum. So E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me correct that.

Wait, the energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). Since the neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu = pc. 

So, from energy conservation:
E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ), and E_nu is p c.

So:
sqrt( p² c^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p c = 139.6.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I
