Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, so there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the wave function is a function of x, right? So the real part is a over sqrt(1 + x), and the imaginary part is -0.5i. So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i.

The question says that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 and x > 3. So all the particles are confined between x=1 and x=3. That must mean that the wave function is zero outside this region. But wait, the given wave function is non-zero for all x, unless it's normalized in a way that the probability outside is zero. Oh, wait, no, the given wave function might not be correct beyond x=1 to x=3 because the problem states that when they measured, particles were only found between 1 and 3. So I think the wave function must be zero outside that interval, but the given expression is only valid where the particle exists. So perhaps the actual wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and the given expression (a/sqrt(1+x) -0.5i) applies in between.

Wait, but the given wave function is in the part of space where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is defined as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero elsewhere. That makes sense because measurements only found particles in that region.

Now, the question is to find the numerical value of a. So we need to normalize the wave function. The normalization condition is that the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx from negative infinity to infinity must equal 1. But since ψ is zero outside [1,3], the integral is from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let's write down ψ(x) as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is [a / sqrt(1 + x)]² + (0.5)², because when you square the magnitude of a complex number, it's (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1 + x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral step by step. Let's split the integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

First part: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So this becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2). Because ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln(2), and ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Wait, let me double-check. The limits are from x=1 to x=3. So 1+x goes from 2 to 4. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So setting that equal to 1:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2
