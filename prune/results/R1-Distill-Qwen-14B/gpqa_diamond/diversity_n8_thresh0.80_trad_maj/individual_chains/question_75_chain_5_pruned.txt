Okay, so I've got this question here about a genetics experiment gone wrong. Let me try to unpack what's going on step by step. 

The scenario is that a researcher is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They inserted a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the coding sequence. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. 

Looking at the possible reasons, the question gives the plus strand sequence of the construct. So I need to analyze this sequence to find the issue.

First, let me think about the structure of a gene. The coding sequence starts with a start codon (ATG) and ends with a stop codon (like TAG, TGA, or TAA). The presence of the HA tag at the N-terminus means it's added before the GADD45G sequence.

Looking at the given sequence, the very beginning is 5' ATG TAC... So the first codon is ATG, which is correct as the start. Then the next codon is TAC. Let me break it down:

- The start codon is ATG, which codes for methionine.
- Next is TAC, which is tyrosine. But wait, the HA tag is supposed to be added at the N-terminus. HA is a peptide derived from the influenza virus, and its sequence is usually placed right after the start codon. If the HA tag isn't present, perhaps there's a mistake in the construct.

Wait, but the question says that the construct has the HA sequence introduced. So maybe I should check if the HA sequence is present in the provided DNA.

Hemagglutinin (HA) is a glycoprotein, and its coding sequence is typically around 100 amino acids. But in the given DNA, I don't immediately see a long stretch of nucleotides that would code for the HA. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is a short peptide, like just a few amino acids. For example, sometimes people use epitope tags, like the HA tag which could be just a short sequence.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any in-frame stop codons. Because if there's a stop codon early in the sequence, the ribosome would terminate translation prematurely, leading to a truncated protein.

Let me scan the sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons. 

Looking through the sequence:
- The first few codons: ATG (start), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GCT (Ala), TCC (Ser), etc. No stop codon so far.
Continuing a bit further: ...CCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, looking for the stop codons. Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Hmm, I see a TGA at the end? Let me check the very end. The last part before TGA is ...GCTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. So the last few codons are GAG, TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop.

Ah, but wait, what's before that? Let me look at the sequence from the start.

Wait, the sequence ends with ...AGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. That's correct because the coding sequence should
