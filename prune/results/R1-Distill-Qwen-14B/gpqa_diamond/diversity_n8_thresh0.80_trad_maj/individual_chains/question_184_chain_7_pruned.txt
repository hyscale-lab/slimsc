Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about synthesizing a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to figure out the structure. Benzene rings with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. So numbering from one of the substituents, the ethoxy group is at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Wait, actually, I should probably draw this out.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So the numbering would be such that maybe the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. But the substituents' positions matter for the synthesis steps.

The starting material is benzene, and I need to apply a series of reactions to get the target. Let's think about the possible reactions for benzene substitution.

The target has three groups: tert-butyl (a bulky alkyl group), ethoxy (an ether group), and nitro (a strong meta-directing group). Benzene rings can undergo electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which these groups are added will affect the directing of subsequent groups.

I remember that nitration introduces a nitro group, which is a meta-director. The ethoxy group is an activating group (ortho/para director) because it's an ether. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating (since alkyl groups are activating) but it's a bulky group, so it's more of a para-director, but I'm not sure how that plays in when other groups are present.

Wait, but the substituents' positions are 1,2,3 on the benzene ring. So they must be adjacent and in a particular sequence.

Let me think about the steps. The target has ethoxy, nitro, and tert-butyl substituents on the benzene ring. So the order in which these groups are added will determine their positions.

I think that when multiple substituents are added, their directing effects influence where the next group goes. So, the first substituent will determine the position of the second, and so on.

But the problem is about high-yield synthesis, so the order needs to be optimal for each step.

Looking at the options, each option presents a sequence of reactions. So I need to figure out which sequence correctly adds the substituents in
