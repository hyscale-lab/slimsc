Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me think through this. So the question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) meson decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The Pi is initially at rest, and I have the rest masses given. 

Alright, the problem states that the Pi is stationary. So the initial momentum of the Pi is zero, which means the total momentum of the products must also be zero because momentum is conserved. That's an important point.

The rest masses are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, and I remember that neutrinos have very tiny masses, but I think in these kinds of problems, they're often considered massless. Or maybe the problem assumes the neutrino's rest mass is negligible compared to the others? I'll have to keep that in mind. 

So the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the Pi is at rest, the muon and the neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

Now, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy of the products is just the rest mass energy of the decaying particle. So the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino should be equal to the rest mass of the Pi. 

Let me write down what I know:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c² (rest mass)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu ≈ 0 (since neutrino mass is negligible)

Wait, but wait a second. In reality, neutrinos have some mass, but maybe for this problem, it's being ignored. I'll proceed under that assumption unless told otherwise.

So the total energy available is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV. 

But I also know that for each particle, the energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu, and similar for the neutrino. But wait, since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, E_nu would just be its kinetic energy, K_nu. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu and E_nu = K_nu. 

Putting that into the total energy equation: (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu = m_pi c². So K_mu + K_nu = m_pi c² - m_mu c². Let me compute that: 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV. So the sum of the kinetic energies is 33.9 MeV.

But wait, I also have to conserve momentum. Since the Pi is at rest, total momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, and the neutrino's as -p. 

The energy of each particle is given by the relativistic formula: E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². 

So for the muon, E_mu² = p² c
