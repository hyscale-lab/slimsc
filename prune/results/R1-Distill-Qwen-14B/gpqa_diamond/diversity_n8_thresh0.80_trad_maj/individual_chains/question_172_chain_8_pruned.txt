Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation in stars, the Boltzmann distribution is probably involved. Let me think.

The problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, actually, the question says that the energy difference between the levels is given, but the excitation is twice as excited. Wait, how does that work?

Oh right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution gives the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

In this case, for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or some lower state) would be given by this factor. So if star_1 has twice as excited as star_2, that ratio would be different for each star.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's call the two energy levels as level E and E + ΔE. The excitation is the number of atoms in the higher level relative to the lower. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2's ratio.

Wait no, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) in star_1 is twice that of star_2's ratio.

So for star_1, (n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2).

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE / (k T) ). So for each star, this ratio depends on their respective temperatures.

So for star_1: R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star_2: R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

And according to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

So substituting, exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. Ln(R1) = ln(2) + ln(R2).

But wait, ln(R1) = -ΔE/(k T1
