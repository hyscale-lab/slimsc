Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium as observed in a laboratory. Hmm, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light propagates through it. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact principles here.

The problem states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

The options are A, B, C, D, and I have to choose the correct one. Let's think about the concepts involved.

First, I know that the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So when the glass is stationary, the speed would be 1/n if c is taken as 1. But here, the glass is moving, so how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but wait a second. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. So the light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving. How does that influence the speed we measure?

I think I need to consider the frame of reference here. The problem is set in the lab frame, which is where the glass is moving. So, perhaps I should apply the principles of special relativity, specifically the velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities linearly; you have to use the relativistic formula.

But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v. Is v a significant fraction of c? The problem doesn't specify, so I have to assume that v is non-relativistic, or perhaps handle it with the relativistic approach regardless. Hmm, but the options don't look like they come from the relativistic velocity addition formula, which is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler. Let me think in terms of the medium's motion. The glass
