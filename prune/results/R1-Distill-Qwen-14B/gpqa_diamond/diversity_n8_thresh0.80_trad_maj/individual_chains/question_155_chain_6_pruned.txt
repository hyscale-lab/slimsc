Okay, so I've got this problem here about uncertainty in quantum mechanics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The state of the system is given as an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

Wait, so first, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). That's the standard formula from quantum mechanics, right? So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x. Does that mean it's not an eigenstate of P_z? Because in quantum mechanics, observables don't necessarily share eigenstates unless they commute. Since P_x and P_z are components of angular momentum, they don't commute. So the state is definitely not an eigenstate of P_z. Hence, the uncertainty shouldn't be zero, which makes sense.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate ⟨P_z⟩, the expectation value of P_z.
2. Calculate ⟨P_z²⟩, the expectation value of P_z squared.
3. Plug these into the uncertainty formula to get ΔP_z.

Let me start by recalling the matrix form of P_z. From the question, it's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So,

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

The given state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, let me write that as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2,
        1/√2,
        -1/2 ]

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I calculate ψ† P_z ψ. Similarly for ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but since P_z is diagonal, maybe it's easier. Because when you multiply P_z by ψ, you just scale each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

So, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩ first.

P_z is diagonal, so P_z ψ is:

First component: ħ * (-1/2)
Second component: 0 * (1/√2) → 0
Third component: -ħ * (-1/2) → ħ/2

So, P_z ψ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† (P_z ψ) = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] multiplied by [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Calculating that:

(-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2)
= (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/4)
= 0.

Oh, that's interesting. The expectation value of P_z is zero. So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.

Now, for ⟨P_z²⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z² ψ.

But wait, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z² would be:

[ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ( -ħ )^2 ] ]

Which simplifies to:

[ [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So P_z² is a diagonal matrix with ħ², 0, ħ².

Multiplying P_z² by ψ gives:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2)
Second component: 0 * (1/√2) → 0
Third component: ħ² * (-1/2)

So P_z² ψ = [ - ħ² / 2, 0, - ħ² / 2 ]^T.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† (P_z² ψ):

[ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ] multiplied by [ - ħ² / 2, 0, - ħ² / 2 ]

Calculating each term:

(-1/2) * (- ħ² / 2) = (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4
(1/√2) * 0 = 0
(-1/2) * (- ħ² / 2 ) = (1/2)(ħ²/2) =
