Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both are Earth-like, so I guess the main factors are their orbital periods and the size of their stars. Let's see.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Wait, no, more specifically, it's about the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The formula I think is something like P = (R_star / a_orbital) * (something else), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Wait, the transit probability is actually given by the formula P = (R_star / a) * (1 / sqrt(1 - eÂ²)) ), where e is the eccentricity. But in this case, both planets have circular orbits, so e is zero. So the probability simplifies to P = (R_star / a). But wait, that can't be right because the probability depends on the angle in the sky. Oh wait, no, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Oh right! I think the probability is actually P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star/m_planet)^(1/3)) )) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up formulas. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the standard transit probability formula is P = (R_star / a) * ( (R_star + R_planet) / a )? No, that's not right. I think the transit probability is approximately equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because for the planet to transit, the alignment has to be just right. So the probability is roughly R* / a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital radius.

But wait, more accurately, the probability is (R* / a) multiplied by (something else, but maybe if R* is much smaller than a, then it's approximately R*/a. So since both planets have the same host star radius (the question says both host stars have the same radii), that term is the same for both. So the transit probability depends on R*/a. So the larger a is, the lower the probability.

Wait, but no, because if a is larger, R*/a is smaller
