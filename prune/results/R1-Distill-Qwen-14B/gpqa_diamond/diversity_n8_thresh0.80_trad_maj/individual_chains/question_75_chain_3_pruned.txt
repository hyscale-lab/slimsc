Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a construct where they've introduced an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and are now checking the expression. But they're not getting the expected overexpression. The question is why.

Looking at the options, they suggest possible issues with the construct. The provided DNA sequence is the plus (coding) strand of their construct.

Hmm. The construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the first part of the coding sequence should be the HA tag, followed by GADD45G. If they can't overexpress the protein, maybe the construct isn't being expressed correctly. Let's think about possible issues.

Option A: The HA sequence has a mutation. If the HA tag has a missense mutation, then the epitope might not be recognized, but the protein itself would still be expressed. However, the question is about overexpression, not detection. Unless the mutation disrupts the reading frame, but that's not what this option says. So maybe not A.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. But the sequence is provided, so looking for in-frame stop codons. Let me scan the sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me see... Well, the sequence starts with ATG (start codon), so read through. Let's spot any TGA or TAG or TAA.

Looking through the sequence. Let me look for triplets. For example, the sequence has GATGTTCCAGAT (so GAT Gtt Cca gat...). Wait, but I can't see any TGA or TAG jumps. I'll have to look more carefully. For instance, the start is ATG, then TAC CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, at the very end, there's a TGA. Let me check the last part: ...GAGTGA. That's GAG (which is Glu) and TGA. TGA is a stop codon. So the construct ends with TGA. So the HA tag is at the beginning, then the GADD45G coding sequence, ending with a stop codon.

But wait, the construct is designed to be an inducible overexpressionâ€”so the HA tag is just a fusion, meaning that the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and the GADD45G follows, with the stop
