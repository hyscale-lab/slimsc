Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to work through it.

The problem says: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Oh right, because at high speeds, you can't just add or subtract velocities like in classical mechanics. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity, when one frame is moving at velocity u and another at v, is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait wait, wait. Wait, no, because in this case, it's the relative speed. So let me get this straight. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait, no. Wait, no, the question is about the relative speed of the two astronauts as seen from each other's frames. Or wait, no, maybe one is moving at 0.6c, the other at 0.5c. So what's the relative speed? Because they're moving in the same direction.

So if A is at 0.6c and B is at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that. So 0.5c -0.6c is -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (-0.1c)/0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is positive, the magnitude is 0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Wait, but wait, because if you calculate the relative speed, you take the absolute value. So maybe the answer is 0.14c.

Looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one of the clues.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Hmm. Total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is gamma * m c squared.

Wait, but astronaut 1 has mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) ) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) → 1/sqrt(0.64) → 1/0.8 → 1.25.

So energy E1 is gamma1 * m1 c² → 1.25 * 2m c² → 2.5 m c².

Similarly for astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) → 1/sqrt(0
