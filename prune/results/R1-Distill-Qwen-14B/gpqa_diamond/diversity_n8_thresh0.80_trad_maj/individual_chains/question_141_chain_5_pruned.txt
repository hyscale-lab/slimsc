Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it carefully.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the starting material first. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe I'm misreading it. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dichlorobenzene? No, wait. The "-d" part is a bit unclear. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d; perhaps the "d" stands for a substituent.

Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Or wait, maybe the "d" refers to a deuterium? No, that's not making sense. Wait, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. Wait, perhaps the name is 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dichlorobenzene. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure.
