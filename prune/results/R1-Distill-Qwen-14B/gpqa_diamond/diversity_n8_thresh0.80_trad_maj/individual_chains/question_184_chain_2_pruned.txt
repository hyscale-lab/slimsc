Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reactions. The goal is to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the target molecule. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me number them. Position 1 is ethoxy (OEt), position 2 is tert-butyl (t-Bu), and position 3 is nitro (NO2). So, the substituents are at the 1,2,3 positions, which are adjacent in a meta arrangement, but wait, 1,2,3 would actually be adjacent in a row, like 1, 2,3 being next to each other in a line.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Let me think, numbering the ring such that substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. So, substituents are on carbons 1, 2, and 3, which are adjacent. But wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 3 are meta, but 2 is adjacent to both. Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, actually, in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2,3 are adjacent. So substituents are on the 1, 2, and 3 positions, meaning each substituent is next to the other. So, the substituents are in a row. That might complicate the synthesis because adding substituents in such a way requires considering the directing effects and the order of reactions.

So, benzene has no substituents to start. The first step is probably introducing one substituent. Since we're adding three substituents, I need to plan which goes first, which second, which third, and in which order to maximize the yield.

Let me think about the substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (OEt) at position 1.
2. tert-Butyl group at position 2.
3. Nitro group (NO2) at position 3.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating group, ortho/para directing, and the tert-butyl is a bulky substituent which is likely a deactivating, ortho/
