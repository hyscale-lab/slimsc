Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, what's the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? Oh right, EDTA is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. It's a ligand that forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think is written as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion. The formula for the complex would be CaY₂, but wait, no, it's Ca²+ and EDTA^4−, so the formula is Ca(EDTA)²−, meaning the complex has a 2- charge.

So, the given concentration is 0.02 M of this complex. Now, the formation constant, K, is given. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. The formation reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²−. So, the K would be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, in this problem, we're given [CaEDTA²−] as 0.02 M. The question is, what's the concentration of free Ca²+ ions?

So, the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. Since K is large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be very low.

I remember that when a complex dissociates, the concentration of the ions can be found using the formula [Ca²+] = sqrt( (Ksp) / ( [CaEDTA²−] * α ) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formation constant and the dissociation.

Wait, let me get it straight. The formation constant K is given for the formation of the complex. So, K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But in solution,
