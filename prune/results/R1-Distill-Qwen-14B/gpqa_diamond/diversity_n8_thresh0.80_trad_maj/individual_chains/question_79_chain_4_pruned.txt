Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again. So, the compound X is C11H12O, and it's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a commonly used base, often for eliminating reactions. So I think this reaction is probably an acid-catalyzed elimination or something that requires a strong base. Or wait, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide? No, wait, I'm mixing things up. Diazabicyclo compounds are often used as bases, maybe for deprotonation steps in elimination reactions. Alternatively, if the starting material is an epoxide, maybe it's opening under basic conditions. But the product's NMR is given, so the key is to figure out the structure based on the product.

So, the product's 1H NMR has several signals. Let's list them:

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

And the 13C NMR:

13C NMR:
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Hmm. Let me think about the 13C NMR first. The highest shift is 197.7, which is a carbonyl group. Wait, but 197 is more like a ketone or an ester? Wait, no
