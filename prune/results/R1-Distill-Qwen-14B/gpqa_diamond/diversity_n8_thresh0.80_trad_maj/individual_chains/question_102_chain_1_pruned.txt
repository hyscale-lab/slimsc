Okay, so I've got this question here about a scientific experiment involving some vectors and transgenic mice. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

The question is about a bicistronic vector, which means it has two open reading frames (ORFs) in one construct. The vector is lox-Cre-based, I think. So, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, and it's fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Oh wait, and there are some stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. I'm a bit fuzzy on how that works.

So, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong constitutive promoter, so the ligand should be expressed wherever the vector is active. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, meaning that the receptor can be expressed as a separate ORF, probably in a different cell type or under different conditions. Or wait, maybe in the same cell but after the ligand is translated? I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, wait, the vector is bicistronic, so it's designed to express two proteins from one transcript. The CBA promoter drives the ligand ORF, then there's an IRES, and then the receptor ORF. But the IRES would allow for the translation of the receptor without the need for another promoter, right? So the ligand and receptor are co-expressed from the same transcript.

But then there's the stop cassettes. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP between it and mCherry. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 between it and eGFP. Oh, I think I remember that the loxP site is recognized by Cre recombinase. So, in the absence of Cre, the stop cassette blocks expression of the downstream gene. The lox2272 is a variant that only Cre can recognize, but maybe it acts differently. Or wait, maybe it's another arrangement. I think that in the vector, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in a loxP cassette before mCherry. So, normally, without Cre, the stop would prevent expression of mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP, but the stop cassette stops before eGFP unless Cre is present, which would excise the stop.

So, the idea is that when Cre is expressed, it will recombine the lox sites and remove the stops, allowing the fusion proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP) to be expressed.

In the experiment, they transfected primary astrocyte cultures with this plasmid and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They ran a Western blot. The question says that in total proteins, the signal is proportional to actin loading. So, the blot is working, and they can see the proteins based on actin as a loading control.

But then, when they breed mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background and cross them to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the offspring are born. They visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signals, which I assume is eGFP. But they don't see any green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Why? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how that affects the expression of GFP here. The construct is designed for both to be expressed, so maybe this is about whether they're expressed in the same cell or not. If they were in a paracrine relationship, perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But in the vector, both are expressed in the same cell, but if Cre is expressed in a specific cell type, maybe the ligand and receptor are only expressed in the same cells. So, maybe the issue isn't about paracrine but something else.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So, the GFP isn't being properly trafficked. But if it's stuck in the Golgi, then perhaps the GFP wouldn't fluoresce because it's not on the cell surface. But in the Western blot, would that affect detection? If the protein is made but not secreted or not on the surface, maybe the Western would detect it (if it's a cytoplasmic protein). So, if they used an antibody against the receptor, would it be present? Hmm, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so the Western should detect the protein regardless of its localization as long as it's expressed. So, if the Western blot shows the presence of the receptor, then maybe this isn't the issue. But the question didn't state the Western resultsâ€”only that they tested expression. So, perhaps in the Western, they saw the proteins, but in the live mice, GFP isn't visible. So, maybe the problem is with the GFP expression, not the receptor expression.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Both are under the CBA promoter and IRES, which are strong. So, without the enhancer, perhaps the expression isn't happening. But wait, the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe it doesn't require enhancers. Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But if that were the case, the Western blot would show the ligand (since it's under CBA) but not the receptor. But the question doesn't specify the Western results, just that they used the antibodies. So, maybe this is a possibility.
