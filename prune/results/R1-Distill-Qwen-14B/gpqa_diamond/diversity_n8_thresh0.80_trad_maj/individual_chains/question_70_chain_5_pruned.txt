Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the reactions step by step.

First, the problem says that solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I remember that bright red products often make me think of something like sulfur, but maybe not. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a transition metal compound. Oh, wait, what about the reaction involving transition metals?

Then, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces E, which is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like a highly toxic gas, perhaps. Maybe a gas like chlorine or something similar? Or perhaps a compound like phosgene? Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong and weak acidsâ€”so maybe a sulfamic acid or something? Or maybe, for example, if C is a nitrate or sulfate, but considering the acid types, perhaps F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO3? Wait, no, that might not fit the reaction with water.

Wait, another angle. If C is a metal sulfide, but then reacting with water would produce H2S gas, which is a weak acid. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Let's think: if A is something like copper metal, B could be sulfur. Then, 8 equivalents of B (sulfur) reacting with A (copper) would produce CuS? But I'm not sure about that. Wait, copper and sulfur reacting would form Cu2S, which is black, not red. Oh, maybe it's not copper.

Wait, another thought: lead oxide? Lead(II,IV) oxide is brown, but I'm not sure. Maybe something else. Alternatively, think about nitrate reactions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate? Like copper nitrate or something else. When nitrate salts react with water, they can hydrolyze. But let's get back to the first reaction.

Wait, solid A reacting with gas B. Let me think of metals reacting with something. For instance, maybe A is a metal, B is a halogen. But when a metal reacts with a halogen, it forms a salt. So 8 equivalents could make me think of a 1:8 ratio. Wait, what metal and halogen would give a bright red product? Oh, wait, perhaps it's the reaction of iron with sulfur. Iron reacts with sulfur to form FeS, but in excess sulfur, perhaps FeS8? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur and B is something else.

Wait, another idea: maybe A is copper metal and B is sulfur. Copper reacts with sulfur to form Cu2S, which is black, but the product here is bright red. So maybe not that.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is a metal, and B is a sulfur compound. Or perhaps A is a transition metal, and B is a ligand. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a nitride. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So perhaps C is a metal oxide or sulfide, and D is a strong oxidizing agent. For example, if D is chlorine gas, then reacting with C could form something like a metal chloride, but E is hazardous. Alternatively, if C is a sulfide and D is chlorine, it could produce HCl and maybe S, but that's not E.

Wait, perhaps C is an sulfide, and D is something that reacts with it to form a dangerous gas. Oh! Wait, if C is a sulfide and D is an acid, perhaps they react to form H2S, but that's a gas, but H2S isn't extremely hazardous? Or maybe E is a more dangerous gas, like SO2 or something else. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, and D is something like water, but that's not a gas.

Wait, let me think about the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in an aqueous solution, it produces two acids. So perhaps C is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis. For example, if C is a nitrate salt, but hydrolysis of nitrates usually doesn't produce strong acids.

Wait, another angle: maybe C is a sulfide. When a sulfide reacts with water, it can produce H2S (which is a weak acid, G) and maybe another acid. Wait, but what else?
