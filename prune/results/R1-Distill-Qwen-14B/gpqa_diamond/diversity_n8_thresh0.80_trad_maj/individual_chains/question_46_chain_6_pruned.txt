Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of the substituents on a double bond are swapped. Grubbs catalyst, specifically, is a transition metal carbene catalyst used for olefin metathesis. It usually causes the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds, right?

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a substituent on the third carbon. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Or wait, let me count again.

Wait, pentane has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Let me see: the first carbon is CH₂=, second is CH-, third is CH(CH3), then two more carbons. So the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would add a methyl branch on carbon 3, which is the third carbon in the chain. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? But wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3.

Wait, but wait, the starting molecule is racemic. That means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule has a
