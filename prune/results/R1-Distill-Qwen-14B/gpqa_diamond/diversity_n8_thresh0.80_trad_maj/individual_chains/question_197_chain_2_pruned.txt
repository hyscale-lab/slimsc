Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, another reaction—maybe it's the reaction with a benzyne intermediate? Or perhaps it's about the reduction of a nitrile? Hmm, maybe I should think about the reagents again. Oh wait, red phosphorus and HI are used to convert nitriles into amines. No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think that when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes the Stephen reduction, which converts the nitrile to a ketone. Or is that right? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me think: the Stephen reduction uses H2S and a catalyst, I think, to reduce nitriles to ketones. No, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the hydrolysis of a nitrile with strong acid and water gives a carboxylic acid. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Oh, right! Red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or wait, no—another possibility: perhaps it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide, then further to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by first figuring out what Compound X is from its spectroscopic data.

The IR data given is 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, likely due to an -OH stretch or maybe an -NH group. But wait, 3400–2500 could also be due to an alkyne C-H stretch, but that's usually a sharp peak. Alternatively, it could be an O-H stretch, perhaps from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which makes me think of a nitrile. So if the compound has a nitrile group, the IR would show a strong peak around 2200 cm-1. But looking at the given IR, I don't see a peak around there. Hmm, maybe it's not a nitrile then.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's look at the other IR peaks. There's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, possibly a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Then, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretches, which is typical for benzene rings. So, putting that together, maybe the compound is a substituted aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. Like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data: The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first one is 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, integrating to 1H. That's a very high chemical shift, which suggests an acidic proton. So, maybe -COOH, the proton of a carboxylic acid, which is usually around 10-12 ppm. But it's a broad signal, which fits. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but that's a sharp peak, so the broadness here might suggest an -OH, like in a carboxylic acid.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. The protons would be split into two doublets, each with two protons, which suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. So, the aromatic part is likely a para-substituted benzene.

Next, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet of one proton. Maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The 0.9 ppm triplet suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is typical for an ethyl group. The 1.4 ppm doublet of 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH (like a -CH(CH3)- group). The 1.7 ppm multiplet for two protons could be a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or carboxylic acid), and the other is an isobutyl group. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is for a CH2CH3 group. So maybe it's an ethyl chain attached to something else.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. The aromatic ring has two substituents, one at position 1 and another at position 4 (para). Let's say the substituent at position 1 is a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid (if the IR has a peak at 1720). Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the peak would be at around 1700. Wait, 1720 is higher, so probably a ketone or maybe an ester. Wait, a carboxylic acid would have a peak around 1700, but their O-H stretch is broad and strong, which we have in the NMR. But wait, in the IR, the 3400-2500 region could also be due to an -OH (carboxylic acid) or an -NH group. But in the NMR, the broad peak at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid proton, because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 but not as broad, and amine protons are usually in the 1-5 ppm range.

Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl peak would be around 1700-1725 cm-1, which fits. So maybe the substituent at position 1 is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

The other substituent is at position 4. Let's look at the NMR. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group. Then, the 1.7 ppm (2H, m) and 1.4 (3H, d) may suggest a chain like CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, so perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, isobutyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait, no. The structure of isobutyl is actually CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, perhaps I should clarify. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Or is it CH2CH2CH(CH3)?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group. Let me think about the NMR signals. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) indicates a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to something (maybe a CH). The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be two adjacent CH2 groups or a CH and a CH2.

Wait, putting it all together: the substituent on the benzene ring is a propyl group with a branch. Let me imagine a structure where the benzene has a -
