Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about this. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and then calculating the average value of an operator. Let me read the problem again.

The state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not yet a normalized state vector.

Wait, but before that, the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because the spin is up or down, so two states. So the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Hmm. Because when i≠j, so the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2, and the diagonals are zero. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, what's the significance of this operator? Oh, because the eigenstates of this operator would be different from the standard spin-up and spin-down states. Because the standard spin-z operator has eigenstates |up> and |down>, but this operator A is different. So the question is about measuring the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

So first, the plan is: 

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>.
2. Find the eigenstates of the operator A.
3. Express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.
4. The probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in this expansion.
5. The average value is the expectation value of A, which can be calculated using the given state.

Wait, but maybe another approach is possible. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps the eigenstates can be found, and then we can compute the probabilities directly.

Alternatively, since the operator A is the same as the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) * X. The eigenstates of X are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator, which are |+x> and |-x> states.

Wait, the eigenstates of X are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because X is the spin-x operator, which when multiplied by ħ/2 gives the spin operator component in the x-direction.

So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), respectively. Because X has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the first step is to normalize the state |alpha>.

The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. The inner product is (1-i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So the inner product is (1+i)(2 - i)* + (2 + i)(1 - i)*, because the bra vector is the conjugate transpose of the ket vector.

Wait, let me compute each term.

First term: (1+i) * (2 - i)*
Wait, (2 - i)* is 2 + i. So (1+i)(2 + i) = (1)(2) + (1)(i) + (i)(2) + (i)(i) = 2 + i + 2i + i². Since i² =-1, that's 2 + 3i -1 = 1 + 3i.

Second term: (2 - i)* is 2 + i, and the other term is (1 - i) because it's the conjugate of (1 + i). So (2 + i)(1 - i) = 2*1 + 2*(-i) + i*1 + i*(-i) = 2 - 2i + i - i². Since i² = -1, this becomes 2 -i +1 = 3 - i.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. The second term comes from the other part of the inner product.

Wait, the state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, so <alpha| = a* <up| + b* <down|. So when you take <alpha|alpha>, it's a* a + b* b + a* b <up|down> + b* a <down|up>. But since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the cross terms are zero. So <alpha|alpha> = |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So in this case, a = (1 + i), b = (2 - i). So |a|² is (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 + 1 = 2. |b|² is (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 +1 =5. So total is 2 +5 =7. So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Okay, so normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are |+x> and |-x> states.

As I thought earlier, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

We can solve for c1 and c2 by substituting |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c1 [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + c2 [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me rewrite that:

= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

Now, set this equal to the expression for |alpha>:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> = [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

So equate the coefficients:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2)  --> equation (1)
(2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2)  --> equation (2)

Let me solve for c1 and c2.

Multiply both sides of equation (1) by sqrt(2):

c1 + c2 = (1+i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Similarly, equation (2):

c1 - c2 = (2 -i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7)

Now, adding equations (1) and (2):

2c1 = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= (3) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> c1 = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):

2c2 = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (1 +i -2 +i ) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= ( -1 + 2i ) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> c2 = ( -1 + 2i ) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7) )

Hmm, let me compute these expressions.

Wait, maybe instead of solving for c1 and c2, I can use another approach. Let me think about the inner product.

The coefficients c1 and c2 are the inner products of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>, respectively.

So,

c1 = < +x | alpha > 

= [ ( |up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2) ] | alpha > 

= (1/(sqrt(2))) [ < up | alpha > + < down | alpha > ]

Similarly,

c2 = < -x | alpha > 

= [ ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2) ] | alpha > 

= (1/(sqrt(2))) [ < up | alpha > - < down | alpha > ]

So let's compute < up | alpha > and < down | alpha >.

Given that |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7), so when you take the inner product with <up|, you get (1+i)/sqrt(7). Similarly, <down|alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So,

c1 = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (1 + i + 2 - i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= (3 / sqrt(7)) / sqrt(2)
= 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))
= 3/sqrt(14)

Similarly,

c2 = [ (1 +i)/sqrt(7) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (1 +i -2 +i ) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(2)
= (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(14))

So the coefficients are c1 = 3/sqrt(14), c2 = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is |c1|^2, and the probability for |-x> is |c2|^2.

Compute |c1|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Compute |c2|^2: [ (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14) ] squared is [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357143.

Wait, but wait—hold on. Let me compute that again. Because |a + ib|^2 is a² + b².

So for c2, the numerator is (-1 + 2i), so |c2|^2 is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (14) = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

So probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357143.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, which is close but not exact. Let me check if I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the approach. Because the operator A is not the Pauli X matrix. Let's see. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the same as A if A has hbar/2 in the off-diagonal elements. Wait, no, in this problem, A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], so A = (hbar/2) * X, right? So the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2, and the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

So when the state is expressed in terms of these eigenstates, the coefficients c1 and c2 give the amplitudes, and their squares give the probabilities.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.3571), which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So that would match option A's first part: 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7. Let's see about that.

The average value of operator A is the expectation value <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

But another approach is, since |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, then the expectation value is the sum of probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So since c1 is 3/sqrt(14), the probability is 9/14, and eigenvalue is hbar/2 (since A has eigenvalues ± hbar/2 for |+x> and |-x> respectively.

Wait, no. Wait, operator A is (hbar/2) X, so its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> with eigenvalues (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1).

So <A> = (9/14) * (hbar/2) + (5/14) * (-hbar/2 )

= [ (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) ] * hbar/2

= [ (9 -5)/14 ] * hbar/2 

= (4/14) * hbar/2

= (2/7) * hbar/2 

= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7, which matches option A's third value.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7. So option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that would be option A.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46, 3hbar/sqrt(7).

So option A seems correct.

But wait, wait a moment. Let me double-check the calculation of the expectation value.

Alternatively, compute <A> another way.

The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute this:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) , (2+i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [1+i; 2 -i ] 

Wait, let me compute this correctly. Because A is a 2x2 matrix.

Let me represent |alpha> as a column vector: [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ; (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Then, A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]

So,

A |alpha> = [ 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) , (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Wait, no, it's a matrix multiplication. Let me compute it step by step.

A is:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

So, A * |alpha> vector is:

First component: 0 * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Second component: (hbar/2) * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0 * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

So, the resulting vector is [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Now, the bra vector <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product <alpha| A |alpha> is:

[ (1-i), (2+i) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no, because the vectors are row and column vectors.

Wait, the entire expression is:

(1/sqrt(7)) * (1-i) * (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) + (1/sqrt(7)) (2+i) * (hbar/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7)

Wait, no. Because:

<alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i) , (2+i) ] * (hbar/2) [ [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the product as:

= (1/sqrt(7)) * (1-i) * (hbar/2) * (2 - i)/sqrt(7) 
  + (1/sqrt(7)) * (2 +i) * (hbar/2) * (1 +i)/sqrt(7)

So compute each term:

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) (hbar/2) / (7)
Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) (hbar/2) / (7)

Compute each product:

(1-i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + i²
= 2 -3i -1 (since i² = -1)
= 1 -3i.

(2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 +2i +i +i²
= 2+3i -1
= 1 +3i.

So putting it all together:

<alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 - 3i) + (1 +3i) ) ] * (hbar/2) / (7)

= [2 ] * (hbar/2) /7

= (2 * hbar) / (2 *7 )

= hbar/7.

So yes, the expectation value is hbar/7, which matches option A.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6428) and 5/14 (~0.3571), and the expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. Which matches our calculated probabilities (approx 0.64 and 0.36).

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves calculating the probabilities of measuring an electron in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given as \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \) and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined. The state of the electron is given as \( |\alpha\rangle \propto (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator.

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is proportional to \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the inner product \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle \):
\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), with eigenstates:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]
and eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
Substitute \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \):
\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_1 |+x\rangle + c_2 |-x\rangle,
\]
where:
\[
c_1 = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_2 = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities
The probabilities of measuring \( |\alpha\rangle \) in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are:
\[
P(+x) = |c_1|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.642857,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |c_2|^2 = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357143.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The calculated probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
