Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we mix 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, first, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but here we have more than one acid and a strong base, so I need to figure out which is in excess and how much reacts.

So, let me break down each solution's moles. Moles are calculated as Molarity multiplied by Volume (in liters).

Starting with HCl. It's 0.2 M, and 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

Next, H2SO4 is 0.3 M, 300 mL is 0.3 L. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-. So each mole gives 2 moles of H+. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Now for Ba(OH)2. It's 0.5 M, 200 mL is 0.2 L. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when mixing acids and bases, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So I need to find out the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Adding up the H+:
HCl gives 0.1 mol H+
H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol H+
Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- is 0.2 mol from Ba(OH)2.

So the H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. The OH- will neutralize some H+.

When they react, H+ + OH- → H2O. The moles that react are the smaller of the two, which is 0.2 mol here.

So after neutralization, all 0.2 mol OH- will be consumed, and the remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol.

Wait, but wait. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when added to a base, each mole provides two H+ ions. So the initial calculation seems correct.

So, the reaction between H+ and OH- produces water, releasing heat. The amount of heat depends on how much reacts.

The enthalpy change (ΔH) for the neutralization reaction can be calculated using the formula:

ΔH = n(neutralized) × ΔH per mole.

The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ or OH- involved. Wait, wait, no. Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of acid reacting with a base to produce water. So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's about -57 kJ. Or wait, no, the neutralization of one mole of H+ with OH- would release 57 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's negative.

Wait, but sometimes it's given per mole of H2O formed. Let me think. Each mole of H2O comes from one mole of H+ and one of OH-.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of H2O. So the heat released would be
