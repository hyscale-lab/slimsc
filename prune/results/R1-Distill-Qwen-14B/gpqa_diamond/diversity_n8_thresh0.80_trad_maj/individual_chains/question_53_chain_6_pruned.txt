Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there are carbonyl groups attached via oxygen. So I'm thinking ester functional groups, which have the structure O-CO-O probably attached to the ring.

The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let me break down what each signal represents. So, two signals are for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents could be in different positions. If the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would split into two sets – maybe two doublets. Alternatively, if they're ortho or meta, the splitting could be different. But wait, the question doesn't specify where the substituents are, just that there are two signals. So maybe it's a 1,2-disubstitution leading to two sets of protons? Or perhaps a para substitution but with different substituents causing different shifts.

Next, the NMR shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an ester group or maybe an aromatic ring's substituent. Ester groups usually have a carbonyl and an adjacent oxygen. Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester attached to the benzene ring. So, perhaps the structure is something like benzyl acetate or similar. Wait, no, benzyl is more of a CH2Ph group. Alternatively, an ester substituent could be something like OAc (acetoxy) attached to the ring.

But wait, how many vinyl protons are we talking about? If the substituent is an ester, then the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on the benzene are an ester group and another group that has vinyl protons. Wait, but the problem says the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else with vinyl protons.

Wait, but the vinyl protons – the NMR shows two different types. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. That makes me think about coupling. For example, in a trans configuration, vinyl pro
