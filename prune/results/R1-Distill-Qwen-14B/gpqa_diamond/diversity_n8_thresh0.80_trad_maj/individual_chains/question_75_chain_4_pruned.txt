Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and transgenic mice. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They want to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They modified the gene to add an influenza hemagglutinin sequence at the N-terminus, so the recombinant protein has that tag. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine and are checking the expression. But the overexpression isn't happening as expected.

The problem must be in the construct. The given sequence is the plus strand, and the person noticed the issue. The options are possible reasons why expression isn't working.

Looking at the options:

A) The HA sequence has a missense mutation. So maybe the added HA tag isn't correct, so the protein isn't expressed because the tag is messed up. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. If it's a missense, would that prevent the protein from being made at all? Or would it just cause a nonfunctional tag? I'm not sure. Maybe the construct isn't expressed because the tag is not recognized, but the question says the overexpression isn't happening, which could mean no protein is made. So if the HA has a mutation, maybe the purification isn't working, but the expression issue is something else.

B) The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the sequence. So looking at the given DNA, we can look for in-frame stop codons. Let me see, the coding sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. The sequence continues, let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets, which are stop codons.

Wait, the given sequence is the plus strand, so the coding (sense) strand. So in the mRNA, it's the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U. So let me scan the sequence for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TAA: Let's see. Let's break it down. The sequence is a long stretch of nucleotides. Let me look for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Wait, the first few nucleotides are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Oh, wait, after ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT, comes GTT. Then CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA. Wait, TGA is a stop codon. So in the DNA, the coding sequence has a TGA here. Let me make sure this is in the same reading frame.

The start is ATG, so reading frame 1. TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyrosine), GAT (aspartic acid), GTT (valine), CCA (proline), GAT (aspartic acid), TAC (tyrosine), GCC (alanine), AAA (lysine), TGA (stop). So TGA is in frame. So this would cause the ribosome to stop early. That means the protein would be truncated, but only if the stop codon is present and in frame.

Wait, but in the DNA, the coding sequence is the same as the mRNA. So if the DNA has a TGA in the coding strand, the mRNA would have UGA. UGA is a stop codon. So that would cause the ribosome to terminate early, at UGA, leading to a truncated protein. If the HA tag is before this, the protein might not even have the HA tag properly, depending on where the stop is.

But wait, the person added the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA sequence is the beginning of the coding sequence, right? So the initial part of the DNA is the HA tag, followed by GADD45G. If the HA tag is correctly added, but then the coding sequence has an in-frame stop codon, the protein would be truncated after the HA tag.

In that case, the recombinant protein would be shorter than expected, but maybe the HA tag is present. But why isn
