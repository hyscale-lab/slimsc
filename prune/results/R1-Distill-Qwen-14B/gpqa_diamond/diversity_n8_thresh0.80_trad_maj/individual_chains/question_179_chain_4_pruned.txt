Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about several matrices W, X, Y, Z and which statement among the options is correct. The options involve things like whether a vector's norm changes when multiplied by e^X, whether a certain matrix expression represents a quantum state, whether Z and X are observables, and whether W and X are evolution operators.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices are important, especially for operators. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to measurable quantities. The evolution operator, on the other hand, is unitary because it must preserve the norm of the quantum state vectors, ensuring probabilities are conserved.

So let's look at each matrix to see their properties.

Matrix W:
W is given as:
(0, 0, 1;
0, 1, 0;
1, 0, 0)
Let me check if it's Hermitian. A matrix is Hermitian if it equals its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So W's transpose is:

0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

Which is the same as W. So W is Hermitian. But wait, the evolution operator is unitary. So W is Hermitian, which would make it an observable, but not necessarily a unitary matrix. Let me check if W is unitary.

To be unitary, W * W† should equal the identity matrix. Since W is real and symmetric, W† is W. So W squared should be the identity?

Calculating W squared:
First row of W: [0,0,1]
Multiply by each column of W.

First element (1,1) of W²: 0*0 +0*0 +1*1 =1
(1,2): 0*0 +0*1 +1*0=0
(1,3):0*1 +0*0 +1*0=0

Wait, that's the first row. Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

Wait, W squared is:

Row 1:
[ (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (1)(1) , (0)(0) + (0)(1) + (1)(0), (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) ] 
= [1, 0, 0]

Row 2:
[ (0)(0) + (1)(0) + (0)(1), (0)(0) + (1)(1) + (0)(0), (0)(1) + (1)(0) + (0)(0) ]
= [0,1,0]

Row3:
[ (1)(0) + (0)(0) + (0)(1), (1)(0) + (0)(1) + (0)(0), (1)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) ]
= [0,0,1]

So W squared is the identity matrix. So W is its own inverse, and W is unitary because W† = W, so W*W† = I. So W is unitary. So W could be an evolution operator.

Now Matrix X:
X is:
(i, -1, 2i;
1, 0, 1;
2i, -1, -i)

Wait, is X Hermitian? Let me compute its conjugate transpose.

The conjugate transpose of X (denoted as X†) would be:

First row: (−i, 1, −2i)
Second row: (-1, 0, -1)
Third row: (−2i, 1, i)

Wait, let's compute each element. The (1,1) element of X is i, so the (1,1) of X† is i^* = -i. The (1,2) element is -1,
