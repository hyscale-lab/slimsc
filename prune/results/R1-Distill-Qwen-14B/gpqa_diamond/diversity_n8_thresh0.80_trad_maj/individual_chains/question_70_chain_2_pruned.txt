Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about some reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Alright, let's start by looking at the reactions given. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Lastly, gas D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think I need to figure out what these compounds are. Let's start with the reactions. The key here is to identify what each compound is based on the reactions described.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. Let me think about reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in multiple equivalents. One possibility is maybe a metal reacting with a halogen. Like, maybe A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine (Cl2). Because sodium has a valency of 1, and chlorine is diatomic. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean 8 moles? Wait, but sodium is mono-valent. So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would form NaCl, but wait, sodium only has one valence. So 2 moles of Na would react with 1 mole of Cl2, but here it's 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like iron(III) oxide, but that's red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal sulfide? Or perhaps a different compound. Wait, another thought: maybe A is sulfur, and B is something else. No, sulfur is a solid, but reacting with a gas.

Wait, another angle: the product C reacts with D to form E. When C reacts with water, it produces A plus two acids. So C is likely a compound that can undergo hydrolysis. If hydrolysis gives two acids, maybe C is a salt of a diacidic acid? Or perhaps a salt that has two different
