Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian is important in quantum field theory because it describes the dynamics of the system. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γμ, γν]. Oh right, γ matrices are the Dirac matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor from electromagnetism, I think. So this looks like some interaction term involving a spinor field and a gauge field, maybe like a spinor current interacting with a field.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I recall that in 4-dimensional spacetime, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian density should have [Lagrangian] = mass^4.

So let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Each component contributes to the overall dimension. I need to find the dimension of each part.

The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because, in four dimensions, the Dirac equation leads to ψ having dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would also have dimension 3/2. 

Next, σ_{μν} is a tensor made from the gamma matrices. Since each gamma matrix has dimension 1, and σ is an antisymmetric combination of two gammas. So σ_{μν} would have dimension 2. Because each gamma is dimension 1, their commutator is dimension 2. 

Wait, no, wait. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because in natural units, they're matrices without mass dimension. Oh wait, maybe I'm confused. The gamma matrices themselves don't carry mass dimensions; their structure constants or coefficients do. So σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, so dimensionless. Hmm, no, wait, no. Because [γμ, γν] is a commutator which is a combination of products of gammas. But each gamma is a matrix but not carrying mass dimensions. So σ_{μν} is just a dimensionless object.

Wait, no, I'm mixing things. The fields have dimensions, the gamma matrices are just matrices without dimensions. So when I have ψ̄, which is a spinor, it's dimension is 3/2. Then σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, but since each gamma is dimensionless, σ is also dimensionless. 

So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Because each ψ is 3/2.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, it's made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. Wait, A has dimension 1, because the field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative is dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 2. Alternatively, in four dimensions, the field strength tensor F has mass dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Each part contributes as follows:

κ is the coupling constant, dimension to be found. ψ̄ σ ψ is dimension 3, F is dimension 2. So the whole term is κ * (3) * (2) = κ * 6. Wait, but that's not quite right. The product is κ multiplied by the product of the dimensions.

Wait, no, each field contributes its own dimension. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) has dimension 3 as we said, and F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the entire term is dimension [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, because the action ∫L has to be dimensionless in four dimensions (since the integral is over four dimensions). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the term [κ] +5 = 4 → [κ] = -1.

Wait, but wait, actually, I think I messed up the count. Because in the Lagrangian, each field or term's dimension is multiplied by the coupling's dimension. So the term is κ multiplied by the product of the other fields' dimensions.

Wait, no, the term is κ times the product of the fields. So the dimension of each part would be [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F].

Wait, but σ is dimensionless, [σ] = 0. So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] is 3/2, and [F] is 2. So the sum is [κ] + (3/2 +3/2) + 2. That's [κ] + 3 + 2 = [κ] +5.

So the term has dimension [κ] +5, which must equal 4. So [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? I remember that a theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Because higher dimension couplings lead to nonrenormalizable interactions, which require an infinite number of counterterms and thus the theory is not predictive.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The mass dimension of the coupling in a renormalizable theory must be positive or zero. Because, the dimension of the coupling [κ] must be ≥ 0. Because in a renormalizable theory, the interaction terms are of the form (coupling) * (fields), with the coupling's dimension such that the term in the Lagrangian has dimension 4.

So for renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0, because otherwise, when you have loops, higher-order terms would require higher and higher couplings that you can't handle, leading to nonrenormalizable theories.

In this case, [κ] is -1, which is negative. That's a bad sign. So the theory would not be renormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension. So it's a nonrenormalizable interaction.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about it: the maximum mass dimension of the coupling in a renormalizable theory is 4, because in 4D, renormalizable interactions must have couplings with dimension ≤4. But wait, no, the dimension of the coupling is tied to the scaling of the interaction term. For a term like L = g φ^n, the dimension of g is d =4 - (d_φ * (n-1)), where d_φ is the dimension of φ.

But in this problem, the interaction is not a simple φ^k term, but rather a term involving spinors and field strength. But the key point is that the coupling κ has a negative dimension, which implies that the term is of higher dimension, making the theory nonrenormalizable.

Because, in general, all interactions in a renormalizable theory are of the form g φ^m with [g] ≥0, because otherwise you get higher-dimension operators which are not allowed in renormalizable theories.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory is renormalizable. So the answer should be C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 to ensure the action is dimensionless. Breaking down the term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$:

- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, so $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.
- The coupling $\kappa$ has an unknown mass dimension $[\kappa]$.

The total dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, we solve:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. This implies the interaction term is of higher dimension, making the theory nonrenormalizable. Nonrenormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them non-predictive at higher energy scales.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
