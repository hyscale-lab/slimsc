Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound X is based on the reaction and the NMR data provided. Hmm, let's see. The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to match them to the correct starting material among the options A to D.

Wait, what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, when an epoxide reacts with a diamine like this under certain conditions, it can lead to ring-opening, maybe forming an amine or another structure. Or wait, perhaps it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, sometimes this base is used in the Birch reduction, but that usually affects aromatic rings. Or perhaps it's a base-induced ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a carbonyl peak at δ197.7 in the 13C NMR. That's a high shift, typical for a ketone or an aldehyde. Oh, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 200-210, but ketones are lower. Wait, no, 197 is more like a ketone or maybe an ester. Hmm. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this confused. Let me think: carbonyls in 13C NMR. Aldehydes are around 190-205, ketones about 205-225? Or wait, maybe the other way around. Wait, I remember that ketones are usually around 205-220 ppm. So 197.7 is a bit low for a ketone. Hmm, maybe it's an ester or another carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR: the signals are δ2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So that's a singlet for 3H each at 2.28 and 2.31. Could those be two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like if they're adjacent to an electronegative atom or if they're in symmetric positions.

The aromatic region is interesting. The 1H NMR has a doublet at 6.75, then a doublet of 2H at 7.08, another doublet at 7.68, and another doublet of 2H at 7.71. So maybe there's a substitution pattern that's causing this. Let's think about the coupling. Each doublet suggests each proton is coupled to one other proton. So perhaps a para-substitution or a meta, but let me think.

Looking at the 13C NMR data, the carbons are: 21.3 and 28.4 (each singlet, probably quaternary or attached to something that doesn't split), and then several carbons in the 12
