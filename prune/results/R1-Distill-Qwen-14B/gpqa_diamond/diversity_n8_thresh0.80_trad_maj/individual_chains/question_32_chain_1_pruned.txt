Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. RHIC collides heavy ions, and here, the ion is described as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Typically, lithium has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So nucleus X is Li-6.

Next, the energy of the collider is the energy each ion has. Since it's a collider, both ions probably have the same energy but moving in opposite directions. But for the sake of calculation, I think I can just calculate the energy for one ion, assuming it's moving at 0.96c.

The problem gives the speed as 0.96c. So I need to find the total energy of the nucleus, which is relativistic since the speed is a significant fraction of c. The total energy E is given by the equation E = gamma * m_0 c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So with v = 0.96c, let's compute that. Let me compute the denominator first: sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let's calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96... let's see: 0.96 is 96/100. Squaring that gives (96^2)/(100^2) = 9216/10000 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3, sqrt(0.04) is 0.2, so 0.0784 is between. Let me compute it: 0.28^2 is 0.0784. Oh right! Because 28 * 28 is 784, so 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, actually, let me double-check that. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.571428... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me recall the approximate masses. A proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(938 + 939.565) MeV. Wait no, each neutron is about 939.565, so 3 neutrons would be 3 * 939.565. Let me compute this.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, considering that the mass of a proton is about 1.00723 u (atomic mass units), and a neutron is about 1.00866 u. But perhaps it's easier to use the conversion to MeV/c².

Alternatively, I can calculate using the approximate mass of Li-6. Let me think. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 * (mass of a nucleon). The mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is roughly 938 MeV/c². But wait, the exact mass is a bit higher because protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the mass would be 3*(938.272 MeV) for protons, since protons have a mass of about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutrons are about 939.565 MeV/c². So
