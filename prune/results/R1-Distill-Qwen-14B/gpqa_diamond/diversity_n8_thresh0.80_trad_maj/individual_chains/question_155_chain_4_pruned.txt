Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. 

Wait, first, I need to remember how uncertainties work in quantum mechanics. The uncertainty ΔA for an operator A is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, this means that the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. So when I compute expectation values, I can probably just do matrix multiplications.

Given that, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Let me first write down the matrix form of P_z. From the question, the matrix of P_z is:

[ ℏ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ℏ ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix. That should make things easier because the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities of each state.

Wait, but wait. The state is given as a column vector, so let's compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Let me denote the components of |ψ⟩ as (a, b, c) where a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c= -1/2. Then, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is a* P_z[1,1] + b* P_z[2,2] + c* P_z[3,3]. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the first component is for the first basis vector, which has eigenvalue ℏ, the second component is for the eigenvalue 0, and the third is for -ℏ. So:

⟨P_z⟩ = a * ℏ + b * 0 + c * (-ℏ).

Plugging in the values:

a =
