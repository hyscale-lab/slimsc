Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. Okay, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's see, the molecular formula can be broken down into carbons, hydrogens, nitrogen, and oxygen. 

The NMR data is given, which should help in determining the structure. Let's look at the 1H-NMR peaks. The peaks are at 9.72 ppm, which is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Then there are several aromatic regions: 6.98 ppm as a doublet (2H), 6.51 as a doublet (2H), and 6.27 as a broad singlet (2H). The last peak is 3.66 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H, probably some methylene group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester.

So, considering all these peaks, the molecule likely has an aldehyde group (-CHO), a couple of aromatic rings, and maybe some substituents like hydroxyl groups or other functional groups.

The reagents applied are in three steps. First, NaNO2 and HCl. That sounds like a nitrous acid formation, which is often used in diazotization reactions. Diazonium salts are typically formed from aromatic amines, especially in the presence of HCl and cold temperatures. So, maybe the starting compound has an aromatic amine group. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. If it's an amine, the N would be in the amine, but let's think about that.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the compound has a hydroxylamine group, or maybe an amide. But given that the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, which is used in the diazotization of aromatic amines to form diazonium salts.

Wait, but the molecular formula has only one N. So, if the starting compound has an aromatic amine, like an aniline derivative, then the diazonium salt would form. Then the next step is H2O. So maybe a hydrolysis reaction? Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis to produce phenols (if the diazonium is aromatic), especially under certain conditions.

Then the third step is aqueous KOH with heat. That sounds like a hydrolysis condition, perhaps for an ester or a nitrile, but more likely, if we have a diazonium salt that has been converted into something else. Alternatively, it could be a Hofmann elimination or other elimination reactions. Wait, but if the diazonium salt is treated with aqueous KOH and heat, maybe it's a case of the formation of a phenol from the diazonium salt, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the sequence could be diazotization, then hydrolysis to form a phenol, and then another reaction. Let's think about the structure of the starting compound.

Looking back at the NMR: the aldehyde proton is at 9.72, which is typical for an aldehyde. So the molecule has an aldehyde group. Then the aromatic protons. Let's consider splitting patterns. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, for example, two substituents in para positions. But wait, if it's a doublet for each, perhaps it's a coupling between adjacent protons, meaning the aromatic ring is part of a di-substituted benzene, perhaps two substituents meta to each other. Or maybe two substituents in para positions. Wait, the coupling in a doublet suggests each proton is coupled to one other proton. So for example, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent in para positions, the protons on adjacent carbons would be coupled.

Wait, let me think about a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. Then the protons next to each substituent would be equivalent and as a pair, each showing a doublet. For example, if the benzene has two substituents at positions 1 and 3 (but that's meta), or 1 and 4 (para). Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each substituent is at opposite ends, so the adjacent protons would be identical. Hmm, maybe the doublets are from a di-substituted benzene with the substituents in adjacent positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling between vicinal protons on a di-substituted benzene, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think differently. The aromatic protons in the NMR are at 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). So, four aromatic protons in total. So, that suggests two doublets, each two protons. That's typical for a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, where the substituents are para to each other. In such a case, each substituent is in the para position, and the adjacent protons would couple with each other, leading to two sets of doublets. So, each substituent is in the para position, but wait, that's only two substituents. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene, but each substituent has two protons, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents, each of which is a di-substituted group.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule has two benzene rings, each with substituents. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2= (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which could be from one ring and four double bonds, or a combination. But more likely, perhaps two rings and a double bond. For example, benzene rings would account for three double bonds each, but maybe the molecule has two benzene rings.

Wait, but wait: if the molecule has two benzene rings, each benzene contributes 4 degrees (each benzene is three double bonds and a ring, but each ring counts as one degree). Wait, no, each benzene ring is three double bonds, but each double bond is one degree. Wait, no, each benzene ring contributes three double bonds, which is three degrees, and each ring is another degree. Wait, no, wait. The degree of unsaturation is calculated per molecule as each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring, totaling four degrees. So two benzene rings would account for eight degrees, but our total is five, so that's impossible. Hmm, so perhaps the molecule has one
