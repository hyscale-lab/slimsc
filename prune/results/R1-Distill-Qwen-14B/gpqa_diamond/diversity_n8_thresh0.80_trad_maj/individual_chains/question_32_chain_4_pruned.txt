Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So the nucleus would be lithium-6 maybe? Because Li has 3 protons normally, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. Or wait, maybe 3 protons and 3 neutrons? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons naturally. So with 3 neutrons, the mass number A is 3+3=6. So X is Li-6, which is ^6Li.

So first, I need to find the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Or wait, wait, when we talk about the energy in colliders, it's usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or is it? Or is it the total energy, including rest mass, which is gamma times m c squared. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC", and I think in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wait, no, actually, in particle physics, when they say the energy of the collider, it's the kinetic energy. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The total energy E is gamma * m c². So the kinetic energy K is E - m c², which is (gamma -1) m c².

So the problem is asking for the energy, which I think is the kinetic energy. Because if it was the total energy, the options would be way higher. Let me check the options: the options are in GeV, around 20 GeV. So what's the rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus?

Wait, lithium-6 has a mass of about 6 atomic mass units. Wait, 1 atomic mass
