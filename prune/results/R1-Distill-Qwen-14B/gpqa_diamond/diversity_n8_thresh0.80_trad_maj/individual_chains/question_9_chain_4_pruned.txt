Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a certain level of symmetry in the molecule. Let me think. C3h is a type of point group, right? So I need to determine which of these structures has a three-fold axis of rotation and a horizontal mirror plane.

Looking at the options, I have four molecules to consider. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I'm trying to visualize its structure. I think it's a borane with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are like two methyl groups attached to a central CH2. So the molecule has three identical substituents around boron. Would that give it C3 symmetry? Well, if the groups are all the same and arranged symmetrically around the central atom, then yes. But wait, I think triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3B. The structure is trigonal planar around B. Each isopropyl is a bulky group. So when you rotate the molecule by 120 degrees, it should look the same. Also, I'm not sure about the mirror planes here. If there's a horizontal mirror plane, that would contribute to the C3h symmetry. But wait, is there a plane that reflects the molecule onto itself? If the molecule is flat, like trigonal planar, then maybe a horizontal mirror plane exists. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think more.

Next, quinuclidine. I remember quinuclidine has a bicyclic structure, like a bridge. It's a molecule with two bridgehead carbons and a bridge connecting them. The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So the molecule is symmetric but what's its point group? Quinuclidine has a C3 axis because each of the three bridges is symmetric. Wait, no, the symmetry might be higher. I think quinuclidine has a C3 symmetry because of the three identical bridges, but does it have a mirror plane? Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine's structure is such that each bridge is equivalent. So if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane (like a horizontal one)? I'm not certain. Maybe C3 symmetry without the mirror plane would be just C3, not C3h. So perhaps quinuclidine doesn't have a mirror plane, so it doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Now the third option is benzo[
