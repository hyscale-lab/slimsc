Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me think through this step by step.

Hmm, the question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. They both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things.

The host stars are different. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would the stars have the same radius if their masses are different? Maybe because one is slightly evolved, as mentioned. Oh, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved—so perhaps it's a subgiant or something, which might expand a bit but in this case, their radii are same.

The researchers want to choose the planet with the higher probability of transiting. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is related to the size of the planet relative to the star and the inclination of the orbit. Specifically, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But since RV method already detects the planet, we know the orbit has a certain inclination, but perhaps the question here is about the geometric probability.

Wait, the geometric probability for a planet to transit is given by R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius), and R_star is the radius of the star. Or is it (R_star + R_planet) / a? But since the planets are Earth-like, their radii are much smaller than the stars, so probably R_planet is negligible. So P_transit ≈ (R_star) / a.

Wait, no, actually, the formula is (R_star / a) * (R_star / a) but wait, maybe not. Let me think: the probability is roughly (R*)/a, because the planet has to pass in front of the star. The area where the planet can be in the plane (the sky) perpendicular to our line of sight is a circle with radius a (the orbit's radius). The area of this circle is πa². The area where the transit would occur (i.e., the star's disk) is πR_star². So the probability is (R_star / a)²? Wait no, that
