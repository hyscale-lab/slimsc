Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take my time to think it through.

The problem says that there's an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so I guess they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-½ system. So I probably need to normalize the state first because it's only proportional, not necessarily normalized.

First, I should find the normalization factor. The state is given as |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] multiplied by some constant since it's proportional. Let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself to find that constant.

The inner product <alpha|alpha> is equal to |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2 because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. Wait, that's because the cross terms would cancel out due to orthogonality. Let me compute each modulus squared.

|1 + i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because |a + ib|^2 = a² + b². Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> should be (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

So the normalized state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the question is about measuring the eigenstates of another operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Let me think about what this operator looks like. For a 2x2 system (since we have spin up and down), the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, that's correct because when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2, else zero. So this operator is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A = (ħ/2) * X.

Wait, eigenvalues of Pauli matrices are ±1, so the eigenvalues for A would be ± ħ/2.

So to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A. Alternatively, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A and find the coefficients, whose squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is the Pauli X operator scaled by ħ/2, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. These are given by:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix (σx) are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σx |+x> = |+x>, etc. So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x> with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, I can compute the overlap
