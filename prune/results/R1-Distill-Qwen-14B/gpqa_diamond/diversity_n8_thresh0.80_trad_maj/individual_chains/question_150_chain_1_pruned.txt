Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question involves figuring out the structure of a compound based on NMR data and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. 

First, the molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's eight carbons, nine hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. I'm trying to think what kind of compound that could be. Maybe an aromatic compound with some substituents, perhaps an amide or an amine or something with an oxygen functionality like an alcohol or a ketone.

Looking at the NMR data, the important peaks are at 9.72 ppm, which is a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm like that usually corresponds to an aldehyde proton. So, maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule. 

Then, there's a peak at 6.98 ppm, a doublet of 2H. That's in the aromatic region, so likely para-substituted aromatic protons. Another peak at 6.51 ppm, another doublet for 2H. Maybe that's another set of para-substituted aromatic protons. Then, 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H. Broad usually suggests something like an -OH proton, but wait, that's 2H. Hmm, maybe it's a pair of protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a di-substituted ring or in a conjugated system. 

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet for 2H. That's more like a methylene group, maybe next to an electronegative atom. Could be an OCH2 group or something similar.

Putting this together: the molecule has an aldehyde group (from 9.72), two sets of aromatic protons (maybe two phenyl groups), and some substituents. Let me think about how the protons could be arranged.

Wait, the integration adds up: 1 + 2+2+2+2=9 H. Oh wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO, which has 9 H. Wait, no, the integration is 1 (9.72) + 2 (6.98) + 2 (6.51) + 2 (6.27) + 2 (3.66) = 9 H. But the formula is C8H9NO, so that's correct.

So, the molecule has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings (since I see two sets of doublets in the aromatic region), and some substituents. Let's see: maybe the molecule is something like benzaldehyde with substituents, but the formula C8H9NO suggests perhaps a naphthalene derivative, but wait, naphthalene is C10H8, so that's more carbons than we have. So maybe two benzene rings connected somehow, but as substituents.

Alternatively, maybe it's a butyraldehyde derivative with two phenyl groups attached. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1 (X is 0 here). So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde group (another double bond, but that's part of the aldehyde), or perhaps a ring and some double bonds. Wait, but aldehyde is a double bond (C=O), so let me recount.

Wait, benzene ring has 3 degrees (from 3 double bonds). Then, the aldehyde has another one. That's four. Then, perhaps an additional double bond or a ring. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has two benzene rings, but that would need 6 degrees (each ring is 3, two rings would be 6). Wait, but our degree is 5. So that's not possible. Hmm, maybe it's a benzene ring and another double bond, like an enal or something.

Wait, another approach: looking at the reagents used. The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's typically used for diazotization, which is used in the Sandmeyer reaction or for forming diazonium salts, which can then undergo various reactions like substitution or coupling. The second reagent is water, and the third is aqueous KOH with heat. Hmm, that sounds like a hydrolysis reaction, perhaps under basic conditions.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a nitro compound? But the formula is C8H9NO. Nitro groups are NO2, but here it's only NO. Maybe an amide or an amine. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde with an amino group somewhere else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider the possible structures based on the NMR data. The aldehyde proton is at 9.72, which is upfield for an aldehyde but perhaps because of conjugation. The aromatic regions suggest two para-substituted benzene rings. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm could be two different para-substituted aromatic groups. 

Wait, 6.98 is a doublet of 2H, perhaps indicating a substituent (like an electron-donating group) in the para position. For example, an OH group on the benzene ring would make the adjacent protons downfield. Wait, but in that case, the protons would typically be around 6.8-7.3 ppm. But the 6.98 might correspond to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6.98 and 6.51 are two substituents on adjacent positions in a benzene ring. Wait, but the problem states that the NMR has two doublets, 2H each, which would imply two separate sets of two equivalent protons each, which would make sense for two para-substituted benzene rings. So perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings, each with a substituent in the para position. 

Wait, but looking at the options, the starting material might be something like 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Let's think: but-3-enal is an al
