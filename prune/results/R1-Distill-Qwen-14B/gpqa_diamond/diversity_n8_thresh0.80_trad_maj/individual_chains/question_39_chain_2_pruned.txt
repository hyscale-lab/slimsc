Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with wave functions, normalization is a key concept. The wave function must be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1.

The problem states that each particle's wave function is given by ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but wait a second, the wave function should generally be a complex function, right? Because that's standard in quantum mechanics. But I've also heard that the square of the absolute value of the wave function gives the probability density. So maybe the imaginary part doesn't directly affect the normalization as much as I thought, or perhaps I need to consider both real and imaginary parts.

Wait, no. The normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over all space equals 1. Since ψ is a complex function, its square modulus is (real part squared plus imaginary part squared). But wait, in this case, the wave function seems a bit strange. Let me look again: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's (a/(sqrt(1+x))) plus (-0.5i). So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But wait, that can't be right because the wave function usually depends on x, but the imaginary part here is a constant. That's definitely different. So maybe I need to think carefully.

Wait, but the situation described says that when measuring the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, except the problem says ψ(x) is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in the region where it can exist. Wait, no, the first part says that the wave function in a part of space where it can exist is given by that expression. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. Or maybe the given function is only valid in that interval, and zero elsewhere. Hmm, but the problem says none were found outside, so maybe the wave function is zero there, but in the region x between 1 and 3, it's given by that expression.

Wait, but actually, the first part says that the wave function in
