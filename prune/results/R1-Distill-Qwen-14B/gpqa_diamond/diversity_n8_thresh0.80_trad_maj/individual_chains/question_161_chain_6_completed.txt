Okay, so I've got this question about a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

So, the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He's connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The point of this ultra-high vacuum is to minimize gas molecules because that improves electron microscopy by reducing scattering events. But even with all that pumping, some gas particles are still present, detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1, considering factors like the volume, pressure, and temperature of the sample compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd: the mean free path changes to λ2. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect it. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

I remember that the mean free path (MFP) of a gas is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It's given by the formula λ = 1/(n * π * d² / 2), where n is the number density and d is the average collision diameter. Alternatively, I think it's sometimes written as λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and P is pressure. Oh wait, no, maybe another formula. Oh right, another version is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P). But wait, pressure P is related to number density via the ideal gas law: P = nRT. So combining these, the MFP depends inversely on pressure and directly on temperature.

In this scenario, the pressure is the same before and after the electron beam is turned on because the ultra-high vacuum state is maintained, and the temperature remains the same. So why would λ change? That's confusing. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are ionized or charged. Because high-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to become ionized. If the gas particles are charged, they might interact more with the electron beam, but how does that affect their movement in the vacuum?

Wait, in the presence of an electron beam, the gas molecules might become ionized. That means they have an electric charge. Charged particles in an electric field (like from the electron beam or the microscope's electric fields) would experience forces. So if the gas is partially ionized, the ions and electrons would be accelerated, perhaps leading to different behavior than neutral gas molecules.

In an ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is already long because the pressure is very low. So λ1 is the MFP under neutral conditions. But when the electron beam is on, if the gas molecules become ionized, they might have different collision dynamics.

Wait a second, but wait—ionized gas (plasma) behaves differently. The mean free path for charged particles could be shorter because they interact more with each other and with the boundaries, or perhaps longer if the interactions are different. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, another factor: when the electron beam hits the sample, it can cause the sample to heat up, but the question states that the temperature of the sample compartment remains the same. So thermal effects are probably not the cause.

Wait, what about the electron scattering? The question says that Mike observed changes in the mean free path based on electron scattering with gas molecules. So perhaps when the electrons scatter off the gas molecules, the gas molecules might get excited or ionized. If the gas is ionized, their mean free path could change.

Wait, but the mean free path depends on the type of collisions. Charged particles, like ions, have different collision mechanisms. Neutral molecules collide via elastic collisions, but charged particles can have Coulomb interactions, which are longer-range. So in a gas of charged particles, collisions are more frequent because the interaction distance is longer. Wait, no—actually, Coulomb forces are stronger at shorter distances but can act over longer ranges. So if you have charged particles, the effective cross-section for collisions (d in the MFP formula) might be larger because the particles are more likely to interact over a greater distance.

Wait, the cross-section for collision is d^2 for neutral particles. For charged particles, the cross-section might be larger because the effective target area due to electrostatic attraction or repulsion is bigger. So if d increases (or the effective d increases), then λ = 1/(n * π * d²) would decrease. So if d increases, λ decreases.

So in this case, when the gas becomes ionized (charged), the effective collision diameter d increases. Thus, the mean free path λ2 would be smaller than λ1. Because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d gets bigger, λ gets smaller.

So λ2 < λ1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says λ2 < λ1. So that would be the correct answer.


The mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules in a vacuum is influenced by factors such as pressure, temperature, and the effective collision diameter of the molecules. In this scenario, Mike operates a high-resolution transmission electron microscope under an ultra-high vacuum state (< 10^-9 Torr), where the MFP of gas molecules is initially determined as λ1. Upon initiating the electron beam, the MFP changes to λ2, despite the temperature remaining constant.

The key factor causing this change is the ionization of gas molecules due to the high-energy electron beam. Ionized gas molecules become charged, which alters their interaction dynamics. Neutral gas molecules collide elastically, with a collision cross-section determined by their physical diameter. In contrast, charged particles experience Coulomb interactions, which can significantly increase the effective collision cross-section. This increase in the effective collision diameter leads to a decrease in the MFP, as the MFP is inversely proportional to the square of the collision diameter.

Given that λ1 corresponds to the MFP of neutral gas molecules and λ2 corresponds to the MFP of ionized gas molecules, the ionization effect results in λ2 being smaller than λ1. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
