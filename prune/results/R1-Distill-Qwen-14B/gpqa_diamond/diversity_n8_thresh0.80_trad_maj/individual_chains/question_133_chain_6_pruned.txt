Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, so I'll probably need to consider some acid-base chemistry here.

Alright, the problem gives me the volumes and masses of the two compounds. The solution volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The masses of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are both 1.00 grams each. Their molecular weights are 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively.

Wait, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, right? So in solution, the phosphate can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, or PO4^3-. But the form depends on the pH. Since this is a buffer solution, I think the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might come into play here.

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. How do I find that? Hmm, perhaps I should first find out the concentrations of the different phosphoric acid species in solution.

Wait, so the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. And Na2HPO4·2H2O, when dissolved, should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (plus water, but that shouldn't affect the ions). So, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm looking for PO4^3-. That would come from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- can lose another proton to become PO4^3- and H+. The reaction would be HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+. The Ka for this would be Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.

So the concentration of PO4^3- will depend on the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-. But how much is actually present?

Wait, but in this solution, there's a mixture of H
