Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds, so I guess I should be using special relativity formulas here. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses of 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, relative speed. Wait, relativity affects how speeds add up, right? So I can't just subtract their speeds normally because at high speeds, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I get that right.

So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or wait, wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, no, because both are moving in the same direction, from the perspective of someone on A, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)=0.1c? But that's the non-relativistic way. But since their speeds are a significant fraction of c, I can't use that.

So the correct way is to use the relativistic formula. Let me plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So (v1 -v2) = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (v1*v2)/(c²). v1*v2 is 0.6c * 0.5c = 0.3 c². So the denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So putting it together, v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So around 0.14c when rounded, which is about 0.14 times the speed of light. So that's the relative speed between them. Looking at the options, let me see which have v_rel around 0.14c. Option C and D have that. So that narrows it down a bit.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each astronaut, considering their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. Wait, but wait, because energy is frame-dependent. But the problem says "the total energy of the system"—does that mean in the rest frame of the system? Or perhaps it's considering each astronaut's energy in some frame, maybe the lab frame?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rest energy plus their kinetic energies. But let me be careful. The total energy of each astronaut would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for each astronaut, calculate their gamma multiplied by their mass, then add the two energies together.

So first astronaut is 2m moving at 0.6c. Gamma for 0.6c is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/s
