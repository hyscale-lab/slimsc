Okay, so I've got this electron microscopy question here. Let me try to break it down and think through it. Hmm, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. That's a lot, but I think high voltage is common for high-resolution stuff because it increases the beam intensity and resolution.

He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment so the electron beam doesn't get scattered too much. But even with that, some gas particles are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer. So Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path, right, that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

But here's the twist: when he turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. Instead of λ1, it's now λ2. The temperature remains the same, so that factor isn't changing. Why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

I remember that in electron microscopy, the electron beam interacts with the gas molecules. Molecules can get ionized or excited by the electrons. If the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum chamber would experience the electric fields from the electron microscope's lenses and other components. So those charged gas ions might behave differently—like maybe they get attracted to certain parts of the chamber or even get accelerated.

Wait, but how does that affect the mean free path? The mean free path is influenced by the number of collisions a molecule has. If the gas is neutral, the mean free path is based on their elastic collisions. But if the gas is ionized, each ion might have a different behavior. For instance, if the ions are accelerated by the electric fields, they might move faster. Faster-moving ions would have a longer mean free path because they don't collide as often in the same volume.

Wait, but is that the case here? The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure (which relates to the number of molecules), and proportional to the square root of temperature. But in this scenario, the pressure and temperature haven't changed. So why would λ change?

Oh wait, maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces more ionization. So more gas molecules are ionized, leading to charged particles. Charged particles interact differently. Since the electron
