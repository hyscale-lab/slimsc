Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some acids and a base. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions can be calculated using the heat of neutralization data.

The problem gives me three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to mix all of them and find the enthalpy of neutralization. Wait, but waitâ€”wait a second. Because HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, they should neutralize each other.

Wait, but the way neutralization works depends on the stoichiometry of the reaction. So I think I need to find out how much acid and base there is in terms of moles, figure out which is the limiting reagent, and then calculate the heat released based on that.

First, let me calculate the moles of each substance.

HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL. Moles = M * V (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+.

H2SO4: It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives two H+. The molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09
