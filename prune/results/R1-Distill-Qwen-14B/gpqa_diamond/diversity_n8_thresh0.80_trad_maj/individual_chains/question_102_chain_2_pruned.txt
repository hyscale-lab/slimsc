Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, specifically dealing with transgenic constructs and expression. Let me try to unpack what's going on here.

Alright, the setup: the researcher is working with a ligand-receptor pair found in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental roles, probably by tracking where these proteins end up. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means two genes in one construct, right? So the vector has two open reading frames (ORFs), the ligand and the receptor, each with their own fluorescent markers.

The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutively active. Upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which I believe can drive the translation of the second gene without the need for a second promoter. So the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor uses the IRES.

Now, the stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh, right, these are different loxP variants used for Cre-mediated recombination. When Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. So in the vector, the ligand and mCherry are under the same promoter (CBA). Once the loxP stops are flanked, Cre will remove them, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP would be expressed when the lox2272 cassette is removed.

Wait, but Cre recombinase is needed to excise those stop cassettes. So in the initial vector, without Cre, the ligand ORF is blocked by the stop, so no ligand is expressed. Same for the receptor. So when you introduce Cre, like in a Cre-expressing cell or organism, the stops are removed, and both the ligand and receptor are expressed along with their respective tags.

In the experiment, they transfected primary astrocyte cultures with the plasmid and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins to check Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin loading, which probably just means they're ensuring equal loading. So presumably, after transfection, the proteins were expressed. But when they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background and crossed it to SOX10-Cre mice, they didn't see a green signal under the microscope.

SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre mice would express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, so in neural crest derivatives, including maybe astrocytes. So in the offspring, which are the result of crossing the homozygous construct mice with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre would be active in neural crest cells.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has this bicistronic vector. When SOX10-Cre is introduced, the Cre would excise the stop cassettes. So the ligand and mCherry would be expressed together, and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed together.

But in the confocal, they're looking for green signal, which is eGFP. They didn't see any green. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Hmm. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell. If they're paracrine, perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But in this setup, they're using the same construct, so both should be expressed in the same cell. Unless the ligand is secreted and the receptor is on the surface. But the question is about why GFP isn't showing, so maybe the expression is in different cells? Not sure yet.

B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent it from being expressed on the cell surface. But the question is about whether it's expressed at all. If it's stuck in the Golgi, maybe it's not properly trafficked. But the Western blot would still detect the protein. Unless it's not synthesized. Not sure.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the vector has the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter. So maybe the expression isn't driven properly. Or perhaps the enhancer wasn't included. But the question says that when they transfected the astrocytes, the Western blot showed
