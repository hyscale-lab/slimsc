Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit from the given options. Let me try to think through this.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. So, they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so if Planet_1 is closer to its star, because a shorter period usually means a smaller orbit. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, they're the same size. I wonder how that affects the transit probability.

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Specifically, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But wait, the RV method tells us the mass, but it doesn't tell us the inclination of the orbit. So, for a transit to occur, the planet's orbit must be aligned in a way that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. 

I think the transit probability formula is something like (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by some factor involving the argument of periastron and the inclination, but maybe for circular orbits, the probability is simplified. Wait, the planets have circular orbits, so that simplifies things. Oh, right, the probability P is approximately (R_star / (a_planet * (1 + sqrt(1 - e^2)))) ), but since e is zero, it's R_star / a_planet. Or maybe it's (R_star / a_planet) squared? Wait, no, I think it's R_star divided by a_planet. Because the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned, and the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet), since the area where the planet can transit is a circle of radius R_star, and the area of possible orbital planes is a function of a_planet.

Wait, maybe the exact formula is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sin i), but wait, if the
