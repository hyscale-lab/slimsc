Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that's lithium-6, right? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6.

Hmm, first I need to find the energy of the nucleus. Since it's a relativistic problem, I remember that the energy of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy equation. The formula I think is E = gamma * m * c squared. But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Oh right, gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

So, the speed given is 0.96c. Let me compute gamma first. Let's see, v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c squared. (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, right. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714. So gamma is 3.5714 approximately.

Next, I need the mass of the nucleus X. X is Li-6, which has 3 protons, 3 neutrons. The mass number A is 6. The atomic mass of Li is approximately 6.941 atomic mass units (u). Wait, no. Wait, wait, actually, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.016 u. Because each proton is about 1.007 u, but in reality, it's better to look up the exact value. But perhaps for this problem, they're using the approximate mass.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the mass using the atomic number and the neutron number. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, each neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total mass is 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665). Wait, no, because protons and neutrons are in the nucleus. So 3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = let's calculate that.

3 * 1.007276 is approximately 3.021828 u.

3 * 1.008665 is 3.025995 u.

Adding those together: 3.
