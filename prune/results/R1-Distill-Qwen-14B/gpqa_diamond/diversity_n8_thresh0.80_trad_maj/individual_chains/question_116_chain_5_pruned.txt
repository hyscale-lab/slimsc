Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. I'll start by reading the question carefully and breaking down each part.

So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A, leading all the way to Compound D, and then I have to choose the correct structure from the options given. Hmm, let's take it one step at a time.

First, looking at Compound A. The proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. I remember that NMR signals can tell us about the structure. Let me think about what these signals might correspond to.

A triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm— typical of a CH3 group. Since 6H is a lot, maybe two sets of three CH3 groups. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H— that sounds like a CH2 group attached to something. Quartet means it's next to a CH2 as well, maybe. Wait, what kind of splitting would that be? Or perhaps it's adjacent to a CH3 group.

I'm thinking maybe it's a di-substituted something. Like, perhaps a cyclohexane ring with two substituents. Or maybe it's a more linear structure, like a diethyl group or something. Wait, 6H as triplet— like maybe two ethyl groups. Because each ethyl group has 2 CH3 groups, but wait, that would be 6 H in each CH3? No, each CH3 has 3 H, so two ethyl groups would have 6 H in their CH3? No, wait, two ethyl groups would have 6 (from each CH2CH3, 3 H in each CH3, so 6 H total). So the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H might be two ethyl groups attached to something else. Oh wait, but the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H. So, the quartet would be the CH2 in the ethyl group. Because in an ethyl group, the CH2 next to another CH2 (like in ethyl groups attached to a central carbon) would split into a quartet. Because each CH2 has two neighboring Hs, so splitting into a quartet. Wait, no, the CH3 is a triplet because it's next to a CH2 with two H. Wait, no, the CH2 would be
