Okay, so I've got this question about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is. Oh right, optical isomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light in different directions. This usually happens when a molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, some other forms of stereoisomerism like geometric isomerism (cis-trans) don't always lead to optical isomerism unless they involve such centers.

Looking at the options given:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at 1,1' position. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. So the molecule has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. I think that biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism based on the rotation around the central bond. But wait, for that to cause optical activity, the arrangement must lead to a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the substituents create a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize: if the two rings each have a nitro and a carboxylate, but in positions that are symmetric, the molecule might not be chiral. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates asymmetry, then maybe it's chiral. I'm not too sure about this one. I'll have to come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is something like CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. The hydroxyl group is on the second carbon. Let's check for chiral centers. The second carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to: CH3 (from the CH2 group?), wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, maybe I should draw it. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxy would be in the middle. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Hmm, wait no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be methyl ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so it's CH3CH(OH)COOH? Then the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- OH
- CH3 (from the adjacent CH3)
- COOCH3 (the ester group)
- and another CH2? Wait, no, the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central CH has:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (the ester)
- and another hydrogen? Because CH is CH in CH(OH). Wait, no, in the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the central carbon is CH, so it's connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and another H on the same carbon. Wait, no. Wait, the central carbon is the second carbon.

Wait, let me count: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central CH is the middle carbon. So it's connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the right)
- and a hydrogen?

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would mean four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H
