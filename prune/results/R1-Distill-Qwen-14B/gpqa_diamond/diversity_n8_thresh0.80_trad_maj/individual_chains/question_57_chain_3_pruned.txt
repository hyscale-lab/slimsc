Okay, so I've got this physics problem about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that we have measured phase shifts δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. And we have to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, and the options are given in fm.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave analysis is given by a formula involving the phase shifts. Oh right! The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l +1) * (e^{iδl} - 1) * Pl(cosθ) ] where the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum value. Also, k is the wave number.

But the question is asking specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, wait, along the incident beam direction would be θ = 0°, right? Because the incident beam is the initial direction of the particles. So we're looking at f(0).

So let's plug θ=0 into the formula. Pl is the Legendre polynomial. Pl(1) is 1 for all l, since Pl(1)=1 for each l. So the expression simplifies because Pl(cos0) = Pl(1) = 1.

So f(0) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l +1) * (e^{iδl} - 1) * 1 ] for l=0 to 4.

Since we only have phase shifts up to l=4 (δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4), the sum goes from l=0 to 4.

The imaginary part of f(0) would be the imaginary part of each term summed up and multiplied by 1/k.

But wait, each term is (2l+1)*(e^{iδl} - 1). Let's compute the imaginary part of each (e^{iδl} - 1) term.

e^{iθ} can be written as cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{iδl} is cosδl + i sinδl. Subtracting 1 gives (cosδl -1) + i sinδl. The imaginary part is sinδl.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * sinδl.

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) * Σ [ (2l+1) * sinδl ] for l=0 to 4.

But wait, what's k? k is the wave number, which is given by k = √(2mE) / ħ. But the problem states that the electrons are 50 MeV. Hmm, but I think in natural units where c=1 and ħ=197.3 MeV fm, but I'm a bit confused on the exact formula.

Wait, electrons have rest mass m_e, which is about 0.511 MeV/c². But since the energy here is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e, we can probably treat it as a relativistic particle and use the non-relativistic formula for k?

Wait, no
