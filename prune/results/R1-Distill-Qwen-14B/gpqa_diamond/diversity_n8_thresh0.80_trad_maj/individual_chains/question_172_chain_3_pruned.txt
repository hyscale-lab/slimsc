Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I think that means the number of excited atoms in a certain energy level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their temperatures, T_1 and T_2, under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k*T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, the excitation level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, let's say the number of atoms in the excited state is 2x, and for star_2, it's x. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the question says the excitation in star_1 is twice as excited. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is higher. Let me think: let's define n1 as the number in the excited level for star_1 and n2 for star_2. Then, the problem says n1 = 2 * n2, perhaps? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited"â€”
