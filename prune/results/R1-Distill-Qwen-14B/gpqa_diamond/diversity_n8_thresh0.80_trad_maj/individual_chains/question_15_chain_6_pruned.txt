Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question gives me two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So their minimum masses are known. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things because eccentricity might complicate things, but maybe not here.

Wait, the host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So higher mass star but same radius? I think that makes sense because more massive stars can be bigger, but maybe here it's a subgiant or something slightly evolved, but let's not get too deep into that.

The key here is the transit probability. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the size of the star, as well as the orbital inclination. The formula for the transit probability is P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (1 / (1 - e²))^(3/2) ), but since both have circular orbits, the eccentricity e is zero, so that part is 1. So P = (Rp/Rs)^2 * (1/ (a(1 - e²)) ) something? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the transit probability actually depends on the alignment of the orbit. The probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2, but that's assuming that the orbit is edge-on. More accurately, the probability is the ratio of the areas of the planet's orbit and the star's disk—something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the chance that the orbit is aligned so that the planet transits. Oh, right! The transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_p / R_s)^2 )^(1/2)) )? No, maybe it's just (R_p / R_s)^2 times something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the ratio of the area that would cause a transit to the total possible area. For a circular orbit, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 *
