Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one for solving higher-dimensional heat equations. Hmm, I remember that matrix exponentials are involved in these kinds of problems, especially when dealing with finite differences and time stepping.

The question is asking about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. The options are A to D. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Stability analysis. I know stability is important in numerical methods, but is it the key factor for converting to parallel? I'm not sure. Stability usually ensures that the errors don't grow, but I don't recall it being directly tied to parallelism.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal conditions can complicate things, but how do they tie into parallel algorithms? Maybe if the conditions involve points outside the local domain, but I'm not certain how that leads to parallelism.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximations are used to model the matrix exponential in a way that can be computed more efficiently. If these approximations have complex roots, they might require handling in a way that allows splitting into different components, which could be parallelized. Because complex roots come in conjugate pairs, perhaps each pair can be treated separately in parallel.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fractions are a way to decompose expressions, which can make computations more efficient. If the approximation can be broken down into simpler parts, each part could be computed in parallel. This might allow the algorithm to split the problem into independent parts, which is what parallel processing is about.

Wait, the question mentions 'parallel splitting' in the setup. So the method involves splitting the problem into parts that can be solved in parallel. If the fractional approximation can be split into parts, like using partial fractions or handling each root separately, that would enable parallel processing.

I'm trying to think about how matrix exponentials are approximated. The matrix exponential is often computed using methods like diagonalization or via approximations like the Taylor series. But in higher dimensions and for parallel processing, sometimes the exponential is split into simpler terms.

Fractional approximation methods, perhaps like those using Pad√© approximants, might have properties that allow decomposition. For example, if the approximation leads to a sum of terms that can be computed independently, each part can be handled in parallel.

Looking at the options again: Option D mentions linear partial fraction. If the approximation can be written as a sum of fractions, each fraction could be evaluated in parallel. Alternatively, complex roots (Option C) could lead to each root's contribution being computed separately, again in parallel.

But wait, in the context of converting a sequential algorithm to parallel, the key factor is how the algorithm's steps can be split into independent tasks. If the approximation method allows for each eigenvalue or each term in a decomposition to be handled independently, that's where the parallelism comes in.

Option D says linear partial fraction. Suppose the approximation is broken down into terms that are linear and can be handled separately. Then each linear part could be computed in a different processor.

Alternatively, complex roots of the approximation (Option C) would mean that each root's exponential has to be computed. Since complex roots come in pairs, maybe each pair can be handled in parallel. But I'm not sure if the presence of complex roots is the key here.

Wait, another angle: When solving PDEs with finite differences, for higher dimensions, the matrix involved is often sparse. Parallel algorithms often exploit the sparsity by decomposing the domain into subdomains. But this question is about the matrix exponential approximation.

I think that if the approximation leads to a decomposition of the matrix exponential into a sum of terms that can be computed independently, each term can be evaluated in parallel. For example, if the approximation is expressed as a sum of terms, each involving a different part of the matrix, or each term being a separate component, then each term can be handled in a parallel process.

Looking at the options, options C
