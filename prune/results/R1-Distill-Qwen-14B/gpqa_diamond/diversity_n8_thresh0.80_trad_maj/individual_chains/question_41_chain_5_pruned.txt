Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium, as observed from a laboratory frame. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, special relativity comes into play, but I'm not entirely sure how all the concepts fit together here.

So, the setup is: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A, B, C, D, with some expressions involving n and v.

Wait, I should think about what I know. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So, when the glass is stationary, the speed of the light beam inside it is 1/n. Because in this problem, c is given as 1, so speed in glass is 1/n.

But now the glass is moving. How does that affect the speed observed in the lab frame? I'm a bit confused because normally, when you have a medium moving relative to the observer, the speed of light in that medium might change, but according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum doesn't change regardless of the observer's motion. But this is not a vacuum; it's a glass medium, so maybe the behavior is different.

Wait, the glass is
