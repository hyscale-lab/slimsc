Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is this chelating agent that binds metal ions like calcium. So the concentration given is for the complex, not the free ions.

The problem asks for the concentration of calcium ions. Oh, right, because in solution, some of the Ca-EDTA complex might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. But wait, I remember that when the formation constant (Kf) is really large, like in this case, the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free calcium ions should be very low.

Wait, the given K is KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. Oh wait, I think Kf is the formation constant for the complex, which is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So if the complex is in solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and I need to find [Ca²+].

Let me think. The formation constant K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But wait, in the solution, the concentration of EDTA would be determined by the dissociation of the complex.

Assuming that the EDTA is all from the complex, because the complex is in excess. Hmm, but wait, the stoichiometric ratio is 1:1 between Ca²+ and EDTA. So when the complex dissociates, each CaEDTA gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−.

So let's set up the equation. Let’s denote the concentration of the complex as C (0.02 M), and the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Then the concentration of free EDTA would also be x, because each complex releases one EDTA when it dissociates.

So according to Kf:

K = [CaEDTA²−]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] ) = (C)/(x * x) = C/(x²)

But wait, no. Because the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it's assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions. So the total EDTA comes from the complex and any dissociation. Wait, but if the complex is much more stable, the dissociation is minimal. So x would be very small compared to 0.02 M. So [Ca
