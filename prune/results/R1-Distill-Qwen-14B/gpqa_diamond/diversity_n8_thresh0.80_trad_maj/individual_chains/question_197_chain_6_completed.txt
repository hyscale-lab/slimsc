Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, mostly substituted benzoic acids or their derivatives.

First, let me look at the IR data. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region that usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the 1720 is a bit on the lower side for a carboxylic acid; carboxylic acids are usually around 1700 cm-1 but can be a bit lower sometimes. Alternatively, esters or ketones might have around 1720. Wait, but the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks might be aromatic C=C stretches. Those are typical for benzene rings.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs) and integrates to 1H. That's a very deshielded proton, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait no, wait. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm, but that's usually a broad peak. Wait, but the broadness here is 'bs' (broad singlet), which fits a carboxylic acid proton, right? Because in D2O, the -COOH proton can exchange and show as a broad peak. Alternatively, an aldehyde could be a sharp peak, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at the other peaks. There's 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. So the aromatic protons are showing as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the compound has a benzene ring with something in the para position.

Then there's a peak at 2.9 ppm, a multiplet integrating to 1H. That might be a methylene or a CH group adjacent to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of 3H, which suggests a CH(CH3) group, maybe a substituent like an isobutyl or something. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3 group, like an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ring with a substituent that has a chain leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, because the IR has 1720, which points to a carbonyl. So maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent like an ester or a ketone.

Wait, looking at the options. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid would have a COOH group, which would explain the 1720 cm-1 (carboxylic acid carbonyl) and the 10.5 ppm peak (the COOH proton). Then the aromatic protons would be at 8.0 and 7.2, which fits with a para-substituted ring.

But wait, the benzoic acid would have substituents in the para position. Let's see, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but wait, sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3), isn't it? No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but wait, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3) something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The 1.4 ppm as a triplet (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2. Wait, but in an isobutyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the 1.4 ppm could be a methyl group attached to a CH, like CH(CH3). Then, the 2.9 ppm could be a CH adjacent to another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let me think: the substituent on the benzene ring is a isobutyl group. The isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? Or is it CH2CH(CH3)- ?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let me try to draw this out. So the benzene ring would have a substituent in the para position. That substituent would be a propyl group attached to a CH, which has another substituent.

Wait, let me think of the NMR signals again. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet for a CH3 attached to a CH2. Wait, no, a triplet would be for a CH2 next to another CH2. Wait, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d, 3H), which would suggest it's a methyl group attached to a CH, which is a split from a neighboring CH group. So perhaps it's a structure like CH(CH3)CH2CH2 something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, no. Let me remember: iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, the iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3) attached to the benzene ring. Wait, no, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? Or is it CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me correct: the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)2? No, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene ring. Then the NMR would show a methyl group at 1.4 ppm as a doublet, perhaps due to coupling with the adjacent CH.

Wait, but let's think of the substituent as a propyl group with a branch. So, the substituent is -O-CO- something. Wait, no, the IR shows a carbonyl group, but the 1720 cm-1 is less than 1700 would be for a carboxylic acid, but perhaps it's an ester or ketone. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the 1720 could be a bit high, but possible.

Wait, another point: the NMR shows a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That might be a CH adjacent to something else, maybe a CH attached to a carbonyl group. So perhaps the substituent on the benzene ring is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's go back to the initial reaction. The question says that the compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That's a typical reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide or an acid, but wait, more accurately, when a nitrile is treated with H2O and red phosphorus, it becomes a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, another possibility is that if there's a carbonyl group, maybe it's a ketone, and reacting with HI might lead to some kind of substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. So if the starting compound is a nitrile, it would convert to a carboxylic acid. But let's think about the structure.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a benzene ring with ethyl group in para position, and a propanoic acid group attached at position 2. So, the substituent would be at position 2, and the ethyl at 4. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups in the 1 and 4 positions. But the IR doesn't show a carbonyl, so perhaps not.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzene ring with a sec-butyl group in the 4 position and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, that would require two substituents on the benzene ring, but the NMR data doesn't show that. Because the aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H, which indicates only one substituent, para-substituted. So if the substituent is a group with a benzoic acid, then the structure would be para-substituted. So in that case, the substituent would be a benzoic acid group, which may not fit if the substituent is a sec-butyl as in option C.

Wait, no. Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a substituent at the 4 position which is a sec-butyl group, and the carboxylic acid group is in the position 1, perhaps? Wait, no, that would mean the substituent is in the 1 and 4 positions, but that would complicate the aromatic NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but the NMR doesn't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group and a chain. Let me think: For the IR, the 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl, which in the case of benzoic acid would be around 1700, but could be 1720 if it's an ester or something else. But the presence of a broad peak at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid proton.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me reevaluate.

The IR data: 3400–2500 (broad) suggests O-H stretch. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, which could be a carboxylic acid (around 1700 cm-1), but sometimes a bit higher for an ester. But the broad peak at 10.5 ppm in the NMR is more indicative of a carboxylic acid, as aldehydes are less likely to be that broad. So the compound is likely a benzoic acid derivative.

So looking at the options again, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring would have the substituent as a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but that would mean the benzene ring has two substituents: the carboxylic acid (at position 1) and the sec-butyl at position 4. Then the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, but that would give a more complex splitting, not two doublets each for 2H. So that would not fit the NMR data, which shows two doublets each for 2H, indicating a para-substituted benzene with only one substituent.

Hmm, so that suggests that the substituent is just a single group on the benzene ring. So perhaps the substituent is an ester or a ketone or a carboxylic acid with some chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group or something.

Wait, the NMR has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might be a CH adjacent to something else. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) which could be a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group, which is attached to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH2CH(CH3)CH2COOH. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a substituent that's a propyl chain ending in a COOH group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent like -(CH2)2COOH, but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, let's think: the substituent is a group attached to the benzene ring that's a chain leading to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH. That would be a 3-pentanoic acid substituent or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch leading to the carbonyl. For example, maybe it's -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH, which would be a 3-methylpropanoic acid substituent. Then, the NMR would have signals for the CH2 groups and the branching.

Wait, the NMR peaks: 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be a terminal CH3. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl attached to a CH, which is then attached to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 groups, and 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH group next to the carbonyl.

So the substituent would be something like -CH2CH(CH3)COOH. That would make the structure 3-methylpropanoic acid attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is a pentanoic acid derivative.

But wait, in that case, the aromatic protons would be in the para position relative to the substituent, and the substituent would be a chain leading to a COOH group.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have a substituent on the 4 position, but that would require only one substituent on the ring, which is the benzoic acid group. Wait, no, because the substituent is the sec-butyl group, and the benzoic acid would be on the same carbon? No, that can't be because the ring can't have two substituents in the same position.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think of the structure as follows: the benzene ring has a substituent that's a chain leading to a carbonyl group. For example, the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)COOH. Then the substituent is a pentanoic acid, but with a branch.

Wait, but how does the NMR fit that? Let me see:

- The 0.9 t (3H) would be the terminal CH3 of the ethyl group.
- The 1.4 d (3H) would be a methyl attached to a CH group.
- The 1.7 m (2H) would be the CH2 groups in the chain.
- The 2.9 m (1H) would be the CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.

So the substituent could be a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2COOH group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH2COOH group (propanoic acid), but that might not explain the branching in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group attached to a carbonyl. Like a ketone. For example, if the substituent is a propionyl group (COCH2CH2CH3), but that would have a ketone at 1720 cm-1.

But the NMR would have a triplet for the CH3 at the end of the chain (0.9 ppm), a quartet for the adjacent CH2 (maybe around 1.4?), etc. Wait, but in this case, the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H, which is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2 group. So perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH(CH2CH3) group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH group. So the substituent is attached to the benzene as a propyl chain, but with a branch leading to the COOH group.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH. So the benzene would have a substituent in the para position: -CH(CH3)CH2COOH. Then the NMR would show:

- The COOH proton at 10.5 ppm.
- The aromatic protons as two doublets (para-substituted).
- The CH(CH3) group would have a triplet somewhere. Wait, but the 2.9 ppm peak is a multiplet for 1H, which could be the CH adjacent to the COOH group.
- The 1.7 ppm (2H) would be from the CH2 group adjacent to the CH(CH3).
- The 1.4 ppm (3H) is the methyl group from CH(CH3), as a doublet because it's attached to a CH which is next to another CH2 group.

Wait, that makes sense. So the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH group attached to the benzene ring in the para position. So the structure would be 4-((Ethenyl)isopropyl)benzoic acid? Or perhaps more accurately, 4-(2-methylpropanoate)benzoic acid. Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively, 4-(2-methylpropiono)benzoic acid? Wait, maybe I'm getting the substituent wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH group, so the substituent is a 2-methylpropanoic acid group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to something else. The 2.9 ppm (1H) is a CH that's adjacent to this group. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent like -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH.

That would make the substituent a 3-methylbutanoic acid group. So the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH attached to the benzene ring.

But I'm not sure if that's matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group in the 4 position, and the benzoic acid is presumably in position 1. But that would require two substituents, which doesn't fit the NMR data. Because the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, which suggests only one substituent on the ring, not two.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain ending in a carbonyl group, and the benzene is para-substituted. So the substituent would be a -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH group.

Wait, but the options don't mention that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure would be a propanoic acid group attached to a benzene ring, which itself has an ethyl group in the 4 position. Wait, that would mean the benzene ring has two substituents: the propanoic acid in position 2 and the ethyl in position 4. But that would complicate the aromatic NMR, which would show more than two doublets. So perhaps that's not correct.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene with a sec-butyl and a methyl group in positions 1 and 4. But that would have no carbonyl, so the IR wouldn't show the 1720 peak. So it's unlikely.

So perhaps the correct structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH group. So the substituent is a 3-methylbutanoic acid group attached to the benzene ring in the para position.

But none of the options directly match that. Wait, looking again at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean the substituent is a sec-butyl group on a benzoic acid. Wait, but that would require the benzene ring to have two substituents: the COOH group and the sec-butyl group. Which would mean the aromatic H NMR would show more splitting than just two doublets. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to reevaluate the NMR data.

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's a typical pattern for a para-substituted benzene ring, where the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl) that deshields the protons ortho and para to it, but since the substituent is para, the ortho protons are in one doublet and the meta in another. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituent is in one position, and the ring has two sets of equivalent protons: the two ortho and the two meta. But in para substitution, the substituent is in position 1, the ortho protons are in 2 and 6, and the meta in 3 and 5. So in that case, the NMR would show two doublets: one for the ortho (more deshielded, maybe 8.0 ppm) and another for the meta (7.2 ppm).

So if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group like a carboxylic acid, then the ortho protons would be more deshielded and appear downfield.

So the substituent is a group that's attached in the para position, which is a carboxylic acid group. So the structure would be benzoic acid with a substituent in the para position.

Wait, but the options don't have a benzoic acid with another substituent. Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have the COOH in position 4, and the sec-butyl in position 1, but that would require the substituents in positions 1 and 4, but that would complicate the NMR, which only shows two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is the carboxylic acid in the para position, and the substituent is a chain leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH group attached to the benzene ring in the para position. Then the benzene ring would have only one substituent, the chain leading to the COOH group. So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (ortho and meta to the substituent), which matches the data. Then the substituent would be a pentanoic acid group with a branch.

But looking at the options, none of them directly match this. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the possible reaction. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That's a common reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So if the starting compound is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But looking back, the IR of the starting compound may have a nitrile peak around 2250 cm-1. But the IR data given is 3400–2500 (broad), 1720, 1610, 1450. So no peak around 2250, meaning no nitrile. So maybe the starting compound is a ketone. Red phosphorus and HI can also be used to reduce ketones, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. But if the starting compound is an ester, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, in the presence of H2O and acid, an ester would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the question is about the product after the reaction, so it's possible that the starting compound is an ester, and the product is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but perhaps the starting compound is a methyl benzoate, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is an aryl ketone, and upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes some kind of substitution. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the starting compound is a benzaldehyde derivative. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more likely a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to look at the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the carboxylic acid is in the para position. Wait, but that would require both groups to be on the ring. Unless the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, and the benzene is part of a benzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group in the para position, and a carboxylic acid group in the meta or ortho position. But that would cause more splitting in the aromatic NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a chain leading to a carbonyl group, and the benzene ring is attached at the end of that chain. Wait, perhaps the structure is a phenyl group attached to a chain that ends with a carbonyl group. For example, phenylpropanoic acid. So the structure would be benzene attached to a propane chain ending with COOH. So the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group leading to COOH.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets (ortho and para to the substituent), which matches the NMR.

Now, looking at the NMR data again:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): COOH proton.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): ortho protons to substituent.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): meta protons.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): CH adjacent to carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): CH2 groups.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): methyl attached to CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): terminal CH3.

So the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH group attached to benzene in the para position.

Wait, but the options don't list this structure. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH2CH2COOH group. Then the NMR would have:

- 0.9 t (3H) for the terminal CH3.
- 1.4 d (3H) might not fit, so perhaps that's not right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)COOH group. But that would not explain the 1.4 ppm doublet.

Wait, let me think about the substituent again. The substituent has a CH(CH3) group, which is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to the benzene. So the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH. So the structure would be 4-((Ethan-2-yl)carbonyl)benzoic acid? Hmm, perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring, and the ring has a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but that would require two substituents on the benzene ring. Which would complicate the aromatic NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3) group, and the COOH is part of that substituent. So the substituent would be a -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH group.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct structure based on the reaction. The starting compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form a product.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. For example, R-C≡N + H2O → R-COOH.

So if the starting compound is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the starting compound is a nitrile, and the product is option C.

Wait, but the IR of the starting compound doesn't show a nitrile peak (around 2250 cm-1). So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: the starting compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. For example, R-O-CO-R' would hydrolyze to R-COOH in acidic conditions. But in that case, the starting material's IR would have an ester peak (around 1740 cm-1), which is higher than the 1720 cm-1 in the given data. So perhaps that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzoyl chloride, but that would have a different NMR and IR.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try to summarize:

The IR suggests a carbonyl group (1720 cm-1), possibly a carboxylic acid or ester. The broad peak at 3400–2500 cm-1 is likely O-H, which fits with carboxylic acid.

The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm (probably a COOH proton), and a para-substituted aromatic ring. The other peaks suggest a chain substituent with a branching.

So the structure is likely a benzoic acid with a substituent chain.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene ring has a sec-butyl group in position 4, and a carboxylic acid group presumably in position 1. But that would require two substituents on the ring, which complicates the aromatic NMR. Because if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6, which would split into more than two doublets.

But the NMR data only shows two doublets, which suggests only one substituent. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a group that includes the carboxylic acid. For example, the substituent is a -COOH group attached via a chain. So the benzene ring has a substituent like -(CH2)CH(CH3)COOH in the para position. So the structure would be 4-((2-methylpropyl)carbonyl)benzoic acid. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COOEt group (ester), and the reaction converts it to a COOH group. So the product would be benzoic acid with a substituent.

But again, the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a methyl benzoate, which upon hydrolysis becomes benzoic acid. But the NMR doesn't fit that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, but the NMR doesn't fit that either.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to look for the correct answer based on the options and the data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In this case, the benzene ring would have a COOH group and a sec-butyl group. But that would require the substituents to be in different positions, leading to more complex NMR splitting. But the NMR shows only two doublets, which suggests only one substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COOEt group, and the product after hydrolysis is a benzoic acid. But again, the NMR data doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH3 group, which is an ester. Then, upon hydrolysis, it becomes -COOH. But the IR would show an ester carbonyl at around 1740 cm-1, but the given IR is 1720. That's possible, but the NMR data would have to match.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH(CH3)2 group. Then, the NMR would show a singlet for the two methyl groups attached to the CH. But in the given NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which suggests a methyl attached to a CH, not a CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, which would be a ketone. But that would not produce a COOH group upon hydrolysis with HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -COCH2CH(CH3)2 group. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. This is a known condition for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. So if the starting compound has a nitrile group, the product would be a carboxylic acid.

Let me check the options again. Option C is a carboxylic acid, so perhaps that's the product. So the starting compound would be a nitrile, which upon hydrolysis gives the acid.

But the NMR and IR data don't show a nitrile. So perhaps the starting compound is a nitrile, and the product is option C.

But I'm not sure about the structure of the starting compound.

Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is an ester, and the product is a diacid, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with a nitrile group. But again, the IR doesn't show a nitrile.

Hmm. Maybe I should think that the starting compound is a ketone, and the reaction is a reduction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzophenone derivative, and the reaction is some kind of substitution. But I'm not sure.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to match the NMR data with the options.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position to the COOH group. So the benzene ring would have two substituents: COOH in position 1 and sec-butyl in position 4. But that would mean the aromatic protons are in positions 2,3,5,6. Position 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be deshielded and appear as one doublet, and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH) would be another doublet. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data.

Wait, that makes sense! So the benzene ring has two substituents: the COOH group in position 1 and the sec-butyl group in position 4. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The ortho protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear as a doublet at 8.0 ppm. The meta protons (3 and 5) would be less deshielded and appear as a doublet at 7.2 ppm. That matches the NMR data.

So the structure of option C would fit the aromatic NMR. Now, what about the other NMR signals?

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH group in the sec-butyl substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 group next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal CH3 of the ethyl group in the sec-butyl substituent.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, the correct structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). No, the correct structure is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene ring. Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Let me draw it:

The sec-butyl group is:

Benzene-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a butyl group. Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, no. The structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that can't be right. Let me correct: the structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached at position 4.

Wait, but then the CH2 groups would be adjacent. So in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH group in the middle of the sec-butyl chain. The 1.7 ppm (2H) would be the CH2 groups next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (3H) would be the terminal CH3.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group in the para position. So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

Now, considering the reaction: the starting compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. If the starting compound is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. So option C would be the product.

Alternatively, if the starting compound is an ester, the reaction would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

But given the IR data, the starting compound has a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1. If it's an ester, the product would be a carboxylic acid, which matches option C.

So putting it all together, the correct option is C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The question involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI, based on the given IR and NMR data. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely O-H stretch), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group, possibly a carboxylic acid or ester), 1610 cm⁻¹, and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretches). The NMR data includes a peak at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, likely a carboxylic acid proton), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) (aromatic protons, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

### Analysis of the NMR Data:
1. **Aromatic Region (8.0 ppm, d, 2H and 7.2 ppm, d, 2H):**  
   The two doublets integrating to 2H each indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, with the substituent in the para position.

2. **Carboxylic Acid Proton (10.5 ppm, bs, 1H):**  
   The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.

3. **Aliphatic Region (2.9 ppm, m, 1H; 1.7 ppm, m, 2H; 1.4 ppm, d, 3H; 0.9 ppm, t, 3H):**  
   - The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) suggests a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) corresponds to a CH₂ group.  
   - The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) indicates a methyl group attached to a CH.  
   - The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) corresponds to a terminal CH₃ group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, the IR data does not show a nitrile peak (~2250 cm⁻¹). Instead, the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or ester. The reaction likely involves the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

### Evaluation of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure implies a benzene ring with an ethyl group in the para position and a propanoic acid group in the ortho position. This would result in more complex splitting in the aromatic NMR, inconsistent with the observed two doublets. Hence, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carbonyl group, inconsistent with the IR data (1720 cm⁻¹). Additionally, the NMR data does not support this structure. Hence, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group. The aromatic protons would appear as two doublets (ortho and meta to the substituents), consistent with the NMR data. The aliphatic signals (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) match the sec-butyl group. This option is consistent with both the IR and NMR data.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   Similar to Option B, this structure lacks a carbonyl group, inconsistent with the IR data. Hence, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The IR and NMR data, along with the reaction conditions, support that the final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
