Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as simple as just subtracting the velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula. The formula for relative velocity u' when one frame is moving at speed v relative to another is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, wait, wait—no, actually, if both are moving in the same direction, then their relative speed would be the difference of their speeds divided by 1 minus the product over c squared. Or is it the other way around? Let me make sure.

So, astronaut A has speed u = 0.6c, astronaut B has speed v = 0.5c. Wait, no, wait! Wait, in the problem, are we calculating the speed of A as seen from B's frame or vice versa? Or perhaps, looking at the way it's phrased, the relative speed between them. So, the relative speed would be the speed of one as seen from the other's frame.

So, let's say I'm astronaut B. I'm moving at 0.5c, and astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the same direction. What's the speed of A relative to me? So, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Plugging in u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c. Let me compute that.

u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) 
Simplify numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u' = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Hmm, so that's about 0.14c. Looking at the options, both C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a start.

Now, the total energy of the system. The total energy should be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy of each is gamma multiplied by m c squared. So, E_total = E_A + E_B.

Each astronaut's energy is E = gamma * m * c². Wait, but their masses are 2m and 3m. So, E_A = gamma_A * 2m c², E_B = gamma_B * 3m c².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me compute each gamma.

For astronaut A: v = 0.6c. So, beta = 0.6. Gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.3
