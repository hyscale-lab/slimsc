Okay, so I have this Lagrangian given here: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm. Alright, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important because it tells us about renormalizability. A renormalizable theory is one where all terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 in four spacetime dimensions.

So, the first part is to find the mass dimension of κ. Let's break down each part of the term.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let's figure out the dimensions of each of these fields.

I know that the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a spinor field in four dimensions, [ψ]_M = 3/2. Similarly, the adjoint ψ̄ would have the same dimension, right? So ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. 

Now, what about σ_{μν}? Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Oh right, the commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, I think. Because they're just matrices, their dimension is zero. So the σ_{μν} would have the same dimension as the gamma matrices, which is zero. Because the gamma matrices are treated as dimensionless objects in natural units.

Then, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism (assuming this is a QED-like interaction). The field strength tensor F has mass dimension 2. Because for a gauge field A_mu (which has dimension 1), the field strength is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So each term in F is ∂A, which is 1+1=2. So [F]_M is 2.

Putting it all together: The term inside the Lagrangian is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's compute each part's dimension:

ψ̄ has 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So multiplying them: (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the total dimension for the product ψ̄σψF is 5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian itself has mass dimension 4 in four dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral in four dimensions is ∫ d^4x L, so [L]_M must be 4.

So the entire term in the Lagrangian is [κ]_M + [ψ̄σψ F]_M = 4. Because the Lagrangian's dimension is 4. So [κ]_M + 5 = 4. So [κ]_M would be 4 -5 = -1. So κ has mass dimension -1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the product of the fields is 5, so κ must have dimension -1 so that when you multiply by it, the total term is dimension 4.

So the first part of the question: the mass dimension of κ is -1. So options A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability requires that all terms in the Lagrangian have mass dimension ≤4. The term here is the interaction term, which is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Wait, but the interaction term's dimension is 4 because the Lagrangian
