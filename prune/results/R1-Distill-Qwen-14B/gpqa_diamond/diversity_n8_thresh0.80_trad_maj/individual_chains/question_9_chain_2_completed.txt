Okay, so I need to figure out which of these molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, wait, what's C3h symmetry again? From what I remember, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for cyclic, and the subscript 3 means it's a three-fold rotation. The 'h' indicates there's a horizontal mirror plane involved. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotational axis and a horizontal mirror plane that passes through the axis.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, that sounds like a complex structure. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. Wait, but I'm not sure about the specifics. The numbering might help, but I'm not super familiar with the structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a tricyclic compound with three furan rings or something. I'm not certain, so maybe I should think about the others first.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo indicates a benzene ring. The structure here has a benzene fused to a trifuran system, which has three furan rings connected? Or maybe a central ring with substituents. Wait, I think benzo[...] usually refers to a benzene fused to another ring system. So this might be a bicyclic compound with three furan rings attached. Not sure about the symmetry here. Benzoquinoline comes to mind, but that's probably not relevant.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Structure-wise, that's boron with three isopropyl groups attached, and an oxygen likely as an ester or something. Wait, triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3BO. So the boron is at the center, attached to three isopropyl groups. Is the molecule symmetrical? Each isopropyl group is the same, so maybe the molecule has some symmetry. Is it C3v or C3h? Wait, is it trigonal planar around the boron? If the three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, then a three-fold rotation should be possible. If the molecule also has a mirror plane, that could give C3h symmetry. But wait, I'm not sure about the presence of a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's C3v symmetry, which would be a trigonal pyramid shape. But I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound. Its structure is a bridge consisting of two carbons, making a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure. Wait, no. Wait, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane, I think. Let me visualize: it's a molecule with a bridge, so it's a norbornane derivative. The structure has a bridge that leads to three-fold symmetry? Let me think about its symmetry. Norbornane has a certain symmetry, but quinuclidine has a bridge that might make the molecule have a three-fold rotation. Wait, no. Quinuclidine's structure is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a cube-like structure but with bridges. Wait, I might be mixing up the structures. Alternatively, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane, which has a bridge that's not symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic structure. Wait, maybe I should think about the symmetry elements. Quinuclidine has a chair-like structure, but I'm not sure about its symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's a seven-membered ring with bridgeheads. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each molecule's structure and symmetry.

Let's start with C3h symmetry. So, a molecule has C3h if it has a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane that includes the axis. So, looking for a trigonal arrangement with a mirror plane.

Looking at each molecule:

1. Triphenyleno[...]trifuran...: Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached to a central structure, perhaps a trifuran which is a system of three fused furan rings arranged in a triangle. Wait, no, trifuran would be three furan rings connected in a line, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the structure has three substituents arranged symmetrically, maybe with a three-fold axis, and a mirror plane.

2. Benzo[...]trifuran...: This has a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The benzene part is symmetric, but the overall structure might not have a three-fold axis. Maybe it's a bicyclic system with a benzene and three furan rings. Not sure about symmetry here.

3. Triisopropyl borate: Structure is three identical isopropyl groups attached to a boron center. The boron is probably in a trigonal planar geometry, with three identical substituents. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis (C3). Now, does it have a mirror plane? Because if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane might be present. But wait, the isopropyl groups themselves are not planar. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. Each isopropyl group is symmetric within itself, but the arrangement around boron is trigonal. So, if the three isopropyl groups are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, then any plane that passes through the boron and two substituents would be a mirror plane. But wait, C3h symmetry requires a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, perhaps the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane that includes the C3 axis.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is non-planar. Wait, the three isopropyl groups are bulky, but they could arrange in a symmetric way, making the molecule have a three-fold axis. If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that's perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then that's a horizontal mirror plane, giving C3h symmetry.

4. Quinuclidine: The structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me imagine. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has three bridges, each with two carbons. So it's a very symmetric molecule. It's a cube-like structure in a way. The molecule has multiple planes of symmetry. Let me think: does it have a three-fold rotation axis? Well, for bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, each bridge is two carbons, so the molecule has multiple axes. Rotating 120 degrees about an axis through the bridgeheads would cycle the three bridges, so that's a C3 axis. Additionally, there are mirror planes. So the molecule might have C3h symmetry. Wait, but the molecule is symmetric in more ways. Alternatively, maybe it has higher symmetry, like Oh or something.

Wait, let me think. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane has a cubic symmetry. So it's quite symmetric. It has four C3 axes, each going through a bridgehead and the center of the opposite face. So if any of these axes are present, along with a horizontal mirror plane, it would have C3h symmetry. But I think the molecule actually has higher symmetry than that, so perhaps it's Td or something. Hmm, but maybe quinuclidine doesn't have C3h symmetry but a higher symmetry.

Wait, another approach: I remember that some molecules have C3h symmetry. For example, molecules like benzene have D6h, but that's not applicable here. Wait, maybe triphenylene has some symmetry. Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound with three benzene rings connected in a triangle. Wait, triphenylene has D3h symmetry, which includes a horizontal mirror plane. So, if the given molecule is triphenylene attached to something else, perhaps it retains that symmetry.

Looking back at the options, option A is triphenyleno[...]trifuran. So it's a triphenylene system connected to a trifuran. If the triphenylene part is symmetric (like in triphenylene itself), then the entire structure may have C3h symmetry. Similarly, option B has a benzo group; perhaps that breaks the symmetry.

Option D is quinuclidine. If it's bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I'm now thinking has a higher symmetry than C3h, so maybe it doesn't fit.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. The structure is (i-Pr)3BO. The boron is in the center with three identical substituents. So the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me imagine. If the boron is at the center, and each isopropyl group is attached symmetrically, then any plane that passes through the boron and two substituents would be a mirror plane. But for C3h, the mirror plane needs to be horizontal, which, in this case, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane but only a C3 axis, making it C3v symmetry instead.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is the one perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, if the three isopropyl groups are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, then a horizontal plane (like the one cutting through the middle) would be a mirror plane. Hmm, but in that case, each isopropyl group would have a plane of symmetry themselves. Wait, but the entire molecule would have that plane. So, maybe triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry.

Wait, another angle. C3h symmetry implies that the molecule's symmetry is based on a three-fold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. So, if you rotate the molecule 120 degrees around the three-fold axis, and then reflect it across the mirror plane, it should look the same.

So for triisopropyl borate, if the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically, then a rotation by 120 degrees would leave the molecule looking the same. Now, the mirror plane would be, say, the plane that cuts through the boron atom and is perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, a reflection across that plane would leave the molecule unchanged. So that would fit the C3h symmetry.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the molecule doesn't have a mirror plane because the isopropyl groups are not symmetrical across that plane. Each isopropyl group is (CH(CH3)2), which itself is symmetric. So, if all three are arranged symmetrically, the molecule as a whole would have that mirror plane.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I'm thinking it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with amine substituents. Wait, no, quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a methyl substituent, I think. Wait, no, quinuclidine is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen. Wait, no, let me correct: quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, but the ring is formed by two bridgeheads and the nitrogen. Wait, perhaps the structure is a bridge with three rings. Hmm, perhaps it's a seven-membered ring with a bridge, making the molecule have a three-fold symmetry.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, making it a cube-like structure with a nitrogen. So, if you have a bridge in each of the three directions, the molecule is highly symmetric. So, it has multiple C2 and C3 axes. So, perhaps it's Oh symmetry, which includes multiple mirror planes. So if the molecule has Oh symmetry, then it certainly has C3h as a subset symmetry. Wait, but the question is about having at least C3h symmetry, not necessarily the highest possible.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think about which options are more likely to have C3h symmetry.

Option A: The triphenyleno group suggests a three-fold symmetry. If the molecule is based on triphenylene (which has D3h symmetry), and if the trifuran part doesn't disrupt that symmetry, then the whole molecule might have C3h symmetry.

Option B: Benzo group attached. The benzene ring has D6h symmetry, but when fused with the trifuran, which is a linear arrangement of three furans, perhaps the symmetry is lower. Maybe this structure has two-fold axes but not three-fold.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. If the three substituents are identical and arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have a three-fold axis. If there's a horizontal mirror plane, then C3h. But I'm not certain if the mirror plane exists.

Option D: Quinuclidine. If it's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a nitrogen, it's a highly symmetric molecule. So, it should have multiple symmetry elements, including C3 axes and mirror planes, thus C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm confused. Let me think again. Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (which is cubane) has Oh symmetry, which includes multiple symmetry axes and planes. So, any such structure would have C3h symmetry as part of its overall symmetry. So quinuclidine, being a derivative, would retain that symmetry if the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, but quinuclidine isn't cubane. Quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which has a bridge structure, making it a molecule with three bridges. So, the molecule has three equivalent bridges, each in a different direction. So, it should have a three-fold rotation axis. And mirror planes as well. So, yes, it should have C3h symmetry.

So which options are left?

Option A: triphenyleno group. If the molecule is based on triphenylene, which has three benzene rings in a symmetric arrangement, then the whole molecule might have C3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine, which would have higher symmetry, so yes, it would have C3h.

Wait, but I'm not sure if quinuclidine has a mirror plane. Let me think. If I imagine looking at the molecule from the top, the mirror plane would be perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry that includes the three-fold axis, then it has a mirror plane. Since quinuclidine is symmetric, I think it does have that.

So, which of the four options has C3h symmetry?

Looking back, the options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

Assuming that quinuclidine (option D) has C3h symmetry.

But wait, another point. The question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. If all of the options except one don't, then the correct answer is the one that does.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate (option C) is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents, giving it C3v symmetry (since it has a three-fold axis and a vertical mirror plane). But C3h would require a horizontal mirror plane, which may not be present in this case. Because the boron is in the center, the mirror plane would be vertical, not horizontal. Because the three substituents are around the boron, any mirror plane would be through the boron and two substituents, which would be vertical, not horizontal. So maybe triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. So it would have C3v symmetry, not C3h.

So, if that's the case, which option is left? Option D (quinuclidine) and option A (triphenyleno...).

Wait, triphenylene has D3h symmetry, which includes a horizontal mirror plane. If the trifuran substituents are arranged symmetrically with the triphenylene, then the entire structure would retain C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the trifuran part might disrupt the symmetry, but perhaps not. So, for option A, a triphenylene core with three substituents symmetrically attached might preserve C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, the substituents might not be symmetric, but that's hard to tell without the structure.

Another thought: quinuclidine, being a bridged bicyclic compound, is symmetric and has multiple planes of symmetry, including the horizontal one. So, if it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact symmetry of each molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the other options.

Benzo[...]trifuran: If it's a benzene ring fused to a trifuran, the symmetry might be lower. The benzene has D6h, but the fusion might lower the symmetry. So probably doesn't have C3h.

Triisopropyl borate: As discussed, probably C3v, not C3h.

So, options A and D are the possible candidates.

Wait, the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry.

If quinuclidine (option D) has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would have C3h. So, perhaps that's the answer.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck because I might be mixing up the structures.

Another approach: look for known structures.

Triisopropyl borate: The structure is (i-Pr)3B(O−). The boron is in the center, with three isopropyl groups and an oxygen. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron, so it has a three-fold rotation axis. Now, for a horizontal mirror plane, it would need a plane that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, if you imagine the three isopropyl groups arranged around the boron in a trigonal planar fashion, the plane that includes the boron and is perpendicular to the plane of the isopropyl groups (i.e., a horizontal plane) would be a mirror plane. Thus, the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The isopropyl groups are not planar. Each is a three-dimensional group. So, the mirror plane would have to pass through the boron and two substituents. But if the substituents are arranged in a trigonal planar fashion, then any plane through the boron and two substituents would be a mirror plane. But that would be a vertical plane, not a horizontal one.

Ah, right. So the mirror plane is vertical, not horizontal. Therefore, the symmetry would be C3v, not C3h. So option C doesn't have C3h symmetry.

So, that leaves option A and D.

Quinuclidine: If it's bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, it's a highly symmetric molecule. It has a three-fold axis, and multiple mirror planes. So, any mirror plane including the three-fold axis would be a symmetry element. Thus, quinuclidine would have C3h symmetry, as well as other symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine is a cube-like structure, which is Oh symmetry, which includes C3h.

So, if option D is quinuclidine, which has higher symmetry, then it definitely has C3h symmetry.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) would have a triphenylene core. Triphenylene itself is symmetric with D3h symmetry. If the trifuran substituents are attached symmetrically, then the overall molecule would retain C3h symmetry. If the substituents are not symmetric, then no. But the name suggests that the substituents are attached in a symmetric fashion (like 1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'' which I think refers to the positions on the triphenylene). So, the substituents are arranged symmetrically, which would preserve the C3h symmetry.

So, options A and D both have C3h symmetry. But wait, the question asks which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry. So, perhaps only one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that quinuclidine is a chair-like structure with a three-fold axis, but I'm not certain about the mirror plane.

Wait, another thought. The C3h symmetry requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. So, in the case of option A, if the triphenylene part is symmetric and the trifuran substituents are arranged symmetrically, then yes, the molecule would have C3h.

But how about the actual substituents? Are they all the same? The name includes hexaone, which suggests ketone groups. So, if each substituent is a ketone at the same position on the trifuran, then the molecule would be symmetric.

So perhaps option A is the correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps triphenylene doesn't have C3h. Wait, triphenylene itself has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So, if the substituents are symmetric, then the whole molecule would have C3h.

But wait, the question is about the molecule in option A. The name is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... So, perhaps the triphenylene is fused to the trifuran in a way that the overall structure has the same symmetry as triphenylene.

Alternatively, if the trifuran is connected in a symmetric way, then the molecule would have C3h.

Putting it all together, I'm thinking that option A is the correct answer because triphenylene has D3h symmetry, and the trifuran substituents are symmetrically attached, preserving the C3h symmetry.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: perhaps the correct answer is D, quinuclidine.

Wait, another point: C3h is a point group. The molecule must have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. If the molecule is in a chair conformation, for example, it might have a C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of which of these molecules is known for having C3h symmetry.

Wait, I think triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran... is a known compound called tautriphenylfuran or something similar, which has a certain symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A because of the triphenylene core.

But I'm still not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again.

Option A: Triphenyleno [...]trifuran-...hexaone. So, the structure has three substituents (from the triphenylene) and three others from the trifuran. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tricyclic system with three benzene rings and three furan rings arranged symmetrically. That would likely have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: elimination.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. As discussed earlier, likely C3v, not C3h. So, C is not the answer.

Option B: Benzo-fused. Probably doesn't have C3h.

So that leaves A and D.

Now, which of them is more likely to have C3h.

Quinuclidine: Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane would have a three-fold axis and multiple mirror planes. So, it would have C3h symmetry.

So, option D (quinuclidine) would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think of the actual molecule. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure with three bridges, each of two carbons. So, the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it has C3h symmetry.

So, perhaps option D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think option D is the correct answer.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h symmetry** requires a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σ) that includes the axis.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
This molecule contains a triphenylene core fused with a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself has **D₃h symmetry**, which includes a three-fold axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σ). If the trifuran substituents are symmetrically attached to the triphenylene core, the molecule would retain **C₃h symmetry**. The numbering suggests that the substituents are arranged symmetrically, preserving the overall symmetry of the molecule.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
This molecule has a benzene ring fused to a trifuran system. The benzene ring contributes **D₆h symmetry**, but the fusion with the trifuran system likely lowers the symmetry. The overall structure does not have a three-fold axis or a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not exhibit **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate
Triisopropyl borate ((i-Pr)₃BO) has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups. This gives the molecule a three-fold rotational axis (C₃). However, the molecule does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σ), as the isopropyl groups are three-dimensional and not symmetric across such a plane. Instead, it has **C₃v symmetry**, not **C₃h symmetry**.

### Option D: Quinuclidine
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure, which is highly symmetric. It has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) and multiple mirror planes, including a horizontal mirror plane (σ). This makes quinuclidine a molecule with **C₃h symmetry**. Additionally, its overall symmetry is consistent with the presence of these symmetry elements.

### Conclusion
Option A (triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone) retains **C₃h symmetry** due to its triphenylene core and symmetrically attached substituents. Option D (quinuclidine) also exhibits **C₃h symmetry** due to its three-fold axis and horizontal mirror plane. However, quinuclidine has higher overall symmetry (Oh), making it the more definitive choice for **C₃h symmetry**.

**Answer: D**
