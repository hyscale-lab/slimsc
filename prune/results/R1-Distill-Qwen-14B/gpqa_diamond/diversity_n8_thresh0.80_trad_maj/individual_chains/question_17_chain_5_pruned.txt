Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions when there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex.

The problem states that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, right? So that's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

I think the formation reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K here would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in different protonated forms. But the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe we don't have to worry about that. Oh, right, because EDTA's protonation state affects the free EDTA^4− concentration. But if the pH is ideal, perhaps the problem assumes that all the EDTA is in the Y^4− form. Or maybe it's considering the alpha fraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says it's a stochiometric solution. So, I think that means the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio because the complex is 1:1. So the initial concentrations are 0.02 M of Ca²+ and 0.02 M of EDTA. But when they form the complex, their concentrations decrease, and the complex's increases.

Wait, no. Wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that means the complex is formed, and the solution has free Ca²+ and free EDTA as well. So I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the free Ca²+ and EDTA concentrations should be very low.

Let me set up the equation. Let's let [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Wait, no. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, so that's the total concentration of the complex. So the initial setup is that the solution has 0.02 M
