Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's an NMR question, which I remember involves analyzing the peaks to figure out the structure of a compound. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is about identifying Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, both 1H and 13C. The options provided are A, B, C, D, each with different structures involving an oxirane (epoxide) group.

Wait, wait. So the reaction conditions include 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is a base, maybe used in an elimination reaction. Oh right, that's the ring-opening of an epoxide under basic conditions. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, the reaction is between compound X and this base. So perhaps X is an epoxide that undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement when treated with a base.

But wait, the product's NMR is what's given. So the product is the result of X reacting with this base. Hmm. But the question is to identify X. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide, but the base is the catalyst here. Or maybe it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, the product's NMR shows specific signals. Let me look at the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

The peaks are:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), so a singlet for three hydrogens. That's likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an electronegative atom like oxygen. Or perhaps attached to a carbonyl or aromatic ring.

Another peak at 2.31 (3H, s). So that's another singlet for three H, another methyl group.

Then, in the aromatic region, 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, that looks like two sets of doublets. Maybe a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents, but with some coupling. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent is causing splitting.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

The carbons are at δ 21.3 (s, 1C), 28.4 (s, 1C), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

The 197.7 is a carbonyl carbon, I think. Maybe from a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, an epoxide ring would have carbons around 50-60, but this is higher, so probably a carbonyl.

Wait, epoxides don't have carbonyls. So maybe the product is a ket
