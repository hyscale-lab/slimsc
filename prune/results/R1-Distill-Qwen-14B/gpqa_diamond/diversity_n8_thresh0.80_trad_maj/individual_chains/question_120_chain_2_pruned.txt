Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, let's think about this. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a larger parallax means a closer star.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed... I guess that means the number density of stars is the same in all directions. But how does that relate to parallax?

So, the number of stars per unit volume would be constant because they're uniformly distributed. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is 1/d, so as d increases, plx decreases.

Let me think in terms of shells. Imagine concentric spheres with radius d. Each shell has an infinitesimal thickness, say dd. The volume of each shell is 4πd² dd, because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell volume is the difference between r+d and r, which approximates to 4πr² dr for small dr.

Since the number density is n (constant), the number of stars in a shell would be n * 4πd² dd. But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax range. So maybe I should express this in terms of parallax instead of distance.

Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's change variables from d to plx. The shell thickness in terms of plx would be d plx = - (1/plx²) d. Because if d increases, plx decreases. So when d changes by dd, plx changes by d plx = - (1/d²) dd, since plx = 1/d. So d plx = - (plx^2) dd, because d = 1/plx. So dd = - (plx²) d plx. Wait, maybe I should do
