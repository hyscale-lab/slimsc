Okay, so I've got this question about stellar atmospheres and elemental abundances. It sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, compared to each other or maybe the Sun. Hmm.

First, I'll read the question carefully. Both stars have higher masses than the Sun: Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2. But I'm not sure yet how their masses factor into the calculation. Maybe mass affects other properties, but the question is about elemental abundances, so perhaps the key here is the given abundance ratios.

The given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, and the photospheric composition of the Sun is provided. Let me jot that down.

Wait, wait. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances. So [Si/Fe] is log(Si/Fe), and [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H). The subscript denotes which star. So Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, meaning [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe abundance relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is 0, that implies that the logarithm of (Fe/H) is zero, so (Fe/H) is 10^0 = 1. So [Fe] in Star_1 is same as [Fe] in the Sun. Same for Star_2 with [Mg/H]_2 =0, so [Mg] in Star_2 is same as Sun.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The notation [X/Y] is log10( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). So when [Fe/H] is 0, that means the ratio Fe/H is the same as in the Sun. So Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, which means Fe abundance is same as Sun. Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, so Mg is same as Sun.

Wait, so for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0, so (Fe
