Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of our Sun. But wait, I don't think the masses directly affect the ratio of silicon atoms, unless it's about how their luminosity or something else affects the calculations. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it; perhaps the masses are just extra info and not needed for this particular calculation.

The problem states that astronomers used the EW method under LTE to determine the elemental abundances. I remember that LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which is an assumption that the gas in the star's atmosphere is in equilibrium. And EW is Equivalent Width, a method used to determine the abundance of elements by measuring the strength of spectral lines. But I'm not sure if I need to remember how EW works in detail here, probably just the given abundances matter.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, the notation here is a bit confusing. I think [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. Oh, wait, no, more precisely, the notation [X/Y] is log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_Sun. So it's a logarithmic abundance ratio. 

So, for Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 means that the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So, [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_Sun = 0. So their ratio is 10^0 = 1. So nFe/nH for Star_1 is same as Sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_Sun = 0.3. So the ratio nSi/nFe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun.

Wait, but I need to calculate the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need (nSi1)/(n
