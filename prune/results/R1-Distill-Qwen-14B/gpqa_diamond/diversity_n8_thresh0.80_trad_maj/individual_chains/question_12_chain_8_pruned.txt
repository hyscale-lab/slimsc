Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in this decay process. Hmm, the reaction given is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. 

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

But wait, the neutrino is involved. Oh right, neutrinos are leptons, but in this case, the muon and the neutrino would carry away energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal magnitude of momentum.

Wait, but how do I calculate their kinetic energies? I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum. Let me set up the equations.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, because it's at rest. So E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino is massless (I think), so its energy is just its momentum times c.

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is -p (since they're opposite). But since neutrino is massless, E_nu = |p|c.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu. 

E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units might be confusing. Maybe better to work in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics. So E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Since m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p. So total energy after is sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p.

Set that equal to the initial energy, 139.6 MeV.

So equation: sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, solving for p. Let me
