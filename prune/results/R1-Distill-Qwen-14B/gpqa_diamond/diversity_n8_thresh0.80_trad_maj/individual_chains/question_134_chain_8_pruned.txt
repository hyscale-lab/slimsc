Okay, so I've got this question about enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions is usually measured in kilojoules per mole or kilocalories per mole.

The question gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me write down their volumes and concentrations. 

HCl is 500 mL of 0.2 M. H2SO4 is 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL of 0.5 M. 

Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic, right? So each mole can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, is a strong base, and each mole gives two OH- ions because it's Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻.

So the reaction here is probably an acid-base neutralization where the H+ from the acids reacts with OH- from the base.

I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess. The enthalpy change would depend on how much of each is neutralized.

Wait, but the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. For strong acids and bases, it's around -57 kJ/mol (H+), or sometimes given as -35.7 kcal/mol. Oh wait, I should check the units. The options have kcal and kJ, so I'll have to be careful.

Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

First, HCl: it's a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). HCl is 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. So 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. Each mole gives 2 H+. So moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 ×2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, so H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all the OH- will react with H+, and some H+ will be left.

So the reaction will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

The enthalpy change for each mole of H+ neutralized is about -57 kJ/mol (if I'm remembering correctly). Alternatively, if the standard enthalpy of neutralization is given as -35.7 kcal/mol, then that's about -57 kJ/mol because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. Let me see: 35.7 kcal ×4.184 ≈ 148.9 kJ, but wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, if one mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ, then 35.7 kcal is about 57 kJ because 35.7 kcal × 4.184 ≈ 148.9 kJ? Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, maybe I have it reversed. Let me think. Wait, I think the standard enthalpy for neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). Or wait, maybe for a monoprotic strong acid and base, it's about -57 kJ/mol. So each mole of H+ gives off 57 kJ of heat.

So for 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 × (-57 kJ) = -1
