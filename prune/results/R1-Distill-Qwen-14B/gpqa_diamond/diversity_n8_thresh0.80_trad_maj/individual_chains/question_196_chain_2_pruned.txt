Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c, and I need to pick the correct formula from the options A to D.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, a simple harmonic oscillator has its maximum speed given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. But this is a relativistic case, so I can't just use that formula. Relativity comes into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light.

So, in the relativistic scenario, I should consider the energy. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², right? And the kinetic energy in relativity is not (1/2)mv² anymore, but something involving gamma, the Lorentz factor.

Wait, the total energy in relativity is given by E = γmc², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for the oscillator, the total energy should also be the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

Wait, no. In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), but in relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So the total energy E is (γ - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx².

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the total energy is conserved, so at the maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is at rest, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So, when x is maximum, the speed is zero, and when x is zero, the speed is maximum.

So at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the total energy E is just the kinetic energy. So E = (γ -1) mc². But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, when x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. But at x=0, the potential is zero, so E is the kinetic energy.
