Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Okay, the question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The goal is to find out which energy difference between them allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, Planck's constant is h, so the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ h/(4π), but sometimes people approximate it as hbar, which is h/(2π), making it ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants here.

Right, so the lifetime of a state is related to the uncertainty in energy. The lifetime is like the time for which the state exists before decaying or transitioning. So the uncertainty in time Δt is related to the lifetime of the state. If a state has a longer lifetime, that means the energy is more precisely known, so ΔE is smaller.

So the question is about the energy difference needed to clearly resolve the two states. I think the key here is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, then the two states might not be distinguishable—they could appear as a single peak or something, making it hard to tell them apart.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by the reciprocal of the lifetime, scaled by Planck's constant. Because the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime.

Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), and h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So, ħ is about 1.055 x 10^-34 J·s.

So let's compute ΔE for each state.

First state: τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 → (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) → 1.055e-25 J. Hmm, but we need this in electron volts. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV: (1.055e-25 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.586e-7 eV. Wait, that's about 6.586e-7 eV. So roughly 1e-6 eV? Wait, that's 0.0000006586 eV.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation. 1.055e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1.055e-25. Then dividing by 1.602e-19 is like 1e-25 / 1e-19 = 1e-6, but with the constants, 1.055 / 1.602
