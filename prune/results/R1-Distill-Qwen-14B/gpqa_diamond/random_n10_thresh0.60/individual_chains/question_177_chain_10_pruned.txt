Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's radiation is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same. So T_1 equals T_2.

Wait a minute, though. The question also mentions their radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s radial velocity, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength could be different from the rest wavelength. Hmm, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So does that mean the observed wavelengths are the same, or the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths? I think it's the observed wavelengths because that's what spectroscopy measures. So if their observed λ_max are the same, then their temperatures as observed would be the same. But wait, the Doppler effect might shift their actual temperatures' corresponding wavelengths. So the actual temperatures could
