Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for calculating this depends on the crystal system. Oh right, for a general crystal system, especially when it's not cubic, the formula involves the lattice parameters and the Miller indices of the plane.

Wait, the crystal here is rhombohedral. So a rhombohedral lattice has all sides equal (a = b = c) but the angles are not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter 'a'? I think so, because each atom is at a lattice point in a simple structure. So a = 10 Angstroms.

The Miller indices given are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is 1/(sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) + ... wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the general formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) + (hkl)(sin terms) / (a² b² c²) ) ) or something more complex. Wait, no, that's for non-orthogonal systems. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system... I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), but wait, wait, no, perhaps more accurately, since in rhombohedral systems, the angles are all the same, the formula simplifies.

Wait, I remember that the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(
