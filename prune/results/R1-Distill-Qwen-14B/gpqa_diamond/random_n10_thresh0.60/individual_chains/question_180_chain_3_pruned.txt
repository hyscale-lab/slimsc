Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric potential energy. Let me read the question again.

So, we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Hmm, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Wait, the system's energy... Oh, right, when you have multiple charges, the electric potential energy is the work done to bring each charge from infinity to their positions. But since the system is isolated and the charges are fixed, the energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge, which is fixed.

But each of the 12 charges is identical. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair. But how many pairs are there?

Wait, the 13th is fixed, so the potential energies are between the 13th and each of the 12. So that's 12 pairs. Each pair contributes to the total potential energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potentials also contribute. Oh wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of them is 2m away from P, but their mutual distances might not be specified
