Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, and they modify the interactions described by the SM.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. Well, the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant. SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional terms that are also supposed to preserve Lorentz symmetry. Because operators in SMEFT are constructed to have the same Lorentz structure as the SM terms, they must respect Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM respects Poincare symmetry, and SMEFT is built from the SM, so I think the higher-dimension operators would as well. But wait, are there any cases where effective operators might break Poincare? I think not, because the operators are local and field-dependent terms don't break translation invariance. So Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.

Then, CP symmetry (3). The SM doesn't necessarily respect CP symmetry, but in SMEFT, do the operators have to preserve it? I'm a bit fuzzy here. Wait, SMEFT includes all possible operators, including those that violate CP. For example, operators like (H† H)^2 can be CP even, but others might have terms that break it. So I think CP symmetry isn't a requirement for all operators in SMEFT. So CP (3) is probably not a must-respect symmetry.

Lastly, CPT symmetry (4). CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially for theories that include spin-½ particles, like the SM. SMEFT must respect CPT because it's part of the underlying structure of the SM. If any operator in SMEFT violated CPT, the theory would have serious issues because it's built upon the SM, which does respect CPT. So I'm pretty sure CPT must be respected (4).

So putting it together, the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) symmetries. So looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) incorporates the Standard Model (SM) and includes higher-dimensional operators that modify SM interactions. These operators are constructed to preserve certain symmetries. 

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The SM is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT operators are built to respect this symmetry. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry must be preserved.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT operators are local and do not break translation invariance, Poincaré symmetry is also preserved.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not necessarily respect CP symmetry, and SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP. Thus, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is fundamental in quantum field theory, particularly for theories involving spin-½ particles like the SM. Since SMEFT is built on the SM, it must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
