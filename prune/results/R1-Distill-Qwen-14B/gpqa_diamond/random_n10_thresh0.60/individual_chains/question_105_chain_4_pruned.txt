Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'll think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, radius same as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The question says this setup can mimic an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve when using photometric observations.

The main point is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as these spots. Without the spots, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness when it transits.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that the flux from a star is related to its temperature and surface area. The formula for flux (F) is sigma * T^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But when part of the star is cooler, like spots, the total flux drops when those spots are facing us.

Wait, but in the case of a planet transiting the star, the planet blocks a part of the star's light, causing a dip. The depth of this dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. So the relative dip (delta F) is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet blocks a circular area.

But in this case, the star has spots that are cooler. So the observed flux when the spots are on the side facing us would be lower. So I need to calculate the total flux from the star when the spots are visible and compare it to when it's not.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their T is 5000 K.

The star is a hemisphere with spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. Oh wait, the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface area that the spots cover. So for the entire star, the area with spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere, so the surface area
