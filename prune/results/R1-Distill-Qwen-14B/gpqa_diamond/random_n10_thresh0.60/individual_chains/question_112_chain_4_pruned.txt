Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and calculating the average value of an operator. Let's see what I can do.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-1/2 system. The operator whose matrix elements are A_ij is given as hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. So, that's the operator we're dealing with.

Wait, the operator matrix A has 2x2 elements because we're dealing with spin-1/2. Let me write that out. The matrix A would look like this:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2, else 0. So, it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator. So, the operator A is given, and we need to find its eigenstates. Because the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate depends on the projection of |alpha> onto those eigenstates.

Hmm, right. So, first, I think I need to find the eigenstates of A. Let's find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So, for matrix A:

[ -λ      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  -λ ]

The determinant is (λ^2) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0. So, λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2. Now, let's find the eigenvectors.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) is:
[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   -hbar/2 ]

Looking for vectors [a; b] such that (A - λ I) [a; b] = 0.

So,

(-hbar/2 a) + (hbar/2 b) = 0 → -a + b = 0 → b = a.

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to [1; 1]. So, perhaps |eigen1> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but normalization. Let's check. The standard eigenvectors for the Pauli matrices are often normalized. Since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenvectors [1,1] and [1,-1] normalized.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Yes, because A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, else 0. So, A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates are the
