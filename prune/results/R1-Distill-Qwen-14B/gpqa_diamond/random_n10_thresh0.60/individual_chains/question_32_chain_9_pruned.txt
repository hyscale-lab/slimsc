Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, and I need to calculate the energy. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you have to use the theory of relativity because Newtonian mechanics don't apply anymore.

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium. Oh right, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's an isotope. Let me think: the standard lithium isotope is Li-7, which has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says 3 neutrons. So the nucleus would be Li with atomic number 3 and 3 neutrons. So that's 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6, making it Li-6.

So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6. The atomic mass (or molar mass) of Li-6 is about... wait, I don't remember the exact value, but I know that in these types of problems, you often use the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Alternatively, you can calculate it using the mass of protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, I can look up the mass of a lithium-6 nucleus. Wait, but I'm just trying to think through this step by step. So, the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/cÂ², and a neutron is about 939.5
