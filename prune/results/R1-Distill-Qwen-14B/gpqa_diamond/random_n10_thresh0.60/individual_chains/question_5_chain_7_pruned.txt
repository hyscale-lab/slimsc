Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, the question is a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step.

First, the problem says that we have a quantum mechanical operator P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. The goal is to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane for the eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, wait. The operator P is a vector operator, so I think it's the spin operator, maybe for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon. Because the components are 2x2 matrices, which makes sense for spin-1/2 systems.

So the operator P can be written as P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So each component is scaled by ħ/2. Wait, actually, looking back, each component P_x is (ħ/2) times a matrix. So P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the standard Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Similarly for P_y and P_z. So the full operator P would be the sum of these components multiplied by the direction vector n.

Wait, the operator is along direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. So n can be
