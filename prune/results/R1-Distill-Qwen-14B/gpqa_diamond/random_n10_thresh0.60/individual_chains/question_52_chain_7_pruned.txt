Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Now, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find out by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, right. So the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the distribution of atoms between energy levels. I remember something about the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The equation is something like:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where n1 and n2 are the populations of the two states, g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, so the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels depends on the temperature. When T decreases, the exponential term decreases. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease if E2 is higher than E1. Because for higher E, lower T makes the exponent more negative, so the ratio goes down.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So the ratio n2/n1 is lower when T is lower.

Wait, wait, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So it's (n2/n1)_6000K / (n2/n1)_5500K.

Let me write that out.

The ratio change factor is ( (n2/n1)_6000 ) / ( (n2/n1)_5500 ) = [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k*6000))) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k*5500))) ]

Oh, wait, the g2/g1 terms cancel out because they're the same in numerator and denominator. So it's exp( ΔE/(k T2) ) / exp( ΔE/(k T1) ), where T1 is the higher temperature, 6000 K, and T2 is 5500 K.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative. So when T decreases, the denominator k T is smaller. So the exponent becomes more negative, making the entire exponential smaller.
