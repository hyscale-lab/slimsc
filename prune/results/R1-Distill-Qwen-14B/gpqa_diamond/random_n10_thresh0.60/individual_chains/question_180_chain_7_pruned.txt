Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Hmm, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that, just the potential energy.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. Oh, so point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So they're all at the same distance from the fixed charge.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is given by the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But since the system is isolated, maybe I don't have to worry about external fields.

Wait, but the charges are identical and all placed symmetrically around point P except the one fixed there. So each of the 12 charges at 2m will interact with the fixed charge at P, and also with each other.

Wait, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but are they placed in a symmetric arrangement like a regular dodecagon or something? Or maybe they're all at the same point? No, that can't be because they're constrained but not fixed. Hmm, but for the
