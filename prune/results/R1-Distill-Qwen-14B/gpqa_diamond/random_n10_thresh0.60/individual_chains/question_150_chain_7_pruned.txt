Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, molecular formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees. So that could be, like, a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds, so 3 degrees), plus maybe an enal (double bond and ring, so that's 2 more? Or wait, one double bond is one degree, an aromatic ring is three. Wait, benzene is three, but each double bond is one. So if the compound has a benzene ring, that's three degrees, and perhaps another double bond and a ring? Or maybe a benzene ring and an aldehyde group, which is a double bond.

Looking at the NMR data they've provided. Let's see:

1H-NMR (ppm):
9.72 (t, 1H) - A triplet at 9.72 ppm. That seems like an aldehyde proton, maybe? Or an acidic proton, like from a phenol? Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's an aldehyde.

Then 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like, two doublets that are couple with each other. So maybe two phenyl groups attached to something else.

6.27 (bs, 2H) - Broad singlet. Broad usually means exchange, like an -OH proton. But two protons? Hmm, maybe a di-substituted aromatic ring where there's some coupling, but maybe it's a coupling to two protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group with two protons that are split into a broad peak because of coupling to something else.

3.66 (d, 2H) - A doublet of two protons. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar.

Putting this together, the structure must have an aldehyde group, an aromatic ring (or maybe two), some CH2 groups, and an oxygen somewhere.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO
