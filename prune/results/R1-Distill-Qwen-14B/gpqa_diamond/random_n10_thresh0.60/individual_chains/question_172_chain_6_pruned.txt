Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And both photospheres are in LTE, which means I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula I remember is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Since the problem is about excitation, I think we're looking at the ratio of atoms in a higher energy level to a lower one.

But wait, in this case, both stars are considering the same energy difference, E. So, for star 1, the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy level compared to star 2. The ratio is 2:1 for star_1 compared to star_2. Or is it the same for both? Hmm, the ratio is given as twice as excited for star_1. So, for star_1, n_i/n_j is 2 times that of star_2's n_i/n_j.

But wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Does that mean (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i/n_j)_2? Or is it that the excitation is higher, so the ratio is higher?

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the populations is higher in star 1. So, n1/(n2) for the higher energy level is 2 times that of star 2. Wait, no, each star has its own ratio. So, for each star, n_i is the population of the excited state, and n_j the ground state. So, the ratio for star 1 is higher than for star 2.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state that's twice as much?

Oh, I think that's correct. So, for star_1: (n_upper / n_lower) = 2 * [ (n_upper / n_lower) for star_2 ].

But wait, wait
