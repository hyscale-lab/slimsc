Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find the right reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

First, I should probably draw out the structures to visualize what's happening. 3-Methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbon atoms and one nitrogen. One of the carbons has a methyl group attached. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group, right? So it's like the pyrrolidine has a substituent that's a cyclohexene attached through a CH2 group.

Wait, so the reaction is acid-catalyzed. Common acid-catalyzed reactions include alkylation, acylation, maybe some kind of addition reaction. But considering the product, maybe it's an alkylation where the pyrrolidine is acting as a base or a nucleophile.

Let me think about the starting material and the product. 3-Methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine, I believe. When amines react under acid catalysis, they can form their conjugate acids, which are more nucleophilic. So perhaps this is an alkylation via an SN2 mechanism
