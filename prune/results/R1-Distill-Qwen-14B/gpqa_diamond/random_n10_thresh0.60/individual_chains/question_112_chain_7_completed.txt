Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slowly because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.

Alright, the question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is given as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> states are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in each eigenstate.

Wait, but wait a second, the question isn't just about the spin-z measurement. It's also about the eigenstates of another operator. Oh right, the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. So Aij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that looks familiar. Let me think about what that operator could be.

The matrix for a 2x2 operator where diagonal elements are zero and off-diagonal are hbar/2. Oh wait! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and if you multiply each element by hbar/2, you get that structure. So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x. Since sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the operator A would have eigenvalues (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), so ±hbar/2.

But wait, the question is about the eigenstates of this operator A. So the eigenstates are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x, right? Because the scaling by a factor doesn't change the eigenstates, just the eigenvalues.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the spin states in the x-direction. So |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Or wait, maybe the signs are different. Let me recall: sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, so yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), multiplied by some phase perhaps, but the exact signs might not matter right now.

So the question is, given the state |alpha>, what is the probability of measuring each of the eigenstates of A (i.e., |+x> and |-x>), and also the average value of the operator A.

But wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, "calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator...". So each eigenstate is |+x> and |-x>, and I need to find the probability of collapsing into each when measured.

So first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, and then the coefficients' squares will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate. Because the probability is |<eigenstate | alpha>|².

So let me write down the state |alpha> first. It's (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, right? Let's compute the normalization factor because the state is given as proportional to that, but I think the actual state should be normalized.

Wait, the question says |alpha> is proportional to that expression. So I need to compute the normalization. Let me compute the norm squared. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2 -i)(2 +i) for the same terms, plus the cross terms.

Wait, no, wait. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So the inner product is (1-i) * (1+i) + (2 + i)(2 - i). Let me compute that.

First term: (1 - i)(1 + i) = 1^2 + (i)^2 - i^2 + i^2? Wait no, (a+ib)(a-ib) = a² + b². So 1² +1² = 2.

Second term: (2 + i)(2 - i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the total norm squared is 2 + 5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Okay, now I need to express this in terms of |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, I think more accurately, |+x> is (|↑> + |↓>)/√2 and |−x> is (|↑> − |↓>)/√2.

So I can express |alpha> as a combination of |+x> and |-x>. Let me compute the coefficients.

Let me let |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>.

So:

(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait, the |alpha> is divided by sqrt(7), so actually:

[ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) = a |+x> + b |-x>.

So, let me write the right-hand side:

a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) = [ (a + b) |up> + (a - b) |down> ] / sqrt(2).

Comparing this to the left-hand side: [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, we have:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i ) / sqrt(7 )

and

( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i ) / sqrt(7 )

So these are two equations with two unknowns, a and b.

Let me write them as:

a + b = (1+i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7 )

a - b = (2 -i) sqrt(2) / sqrt(7 )

Let me add these two equations:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Simplify the numerator:

(1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0 =3.

So,

2a = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

=> a = (3/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Similarly, subtract the second equation from the first:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

Compute the numerator:

1 -2 + i + i = (-1) + 2i.

So,

2b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7 )

=> b = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7 )).

Hmm, but wait, let me compute sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) as 1/sqrt(3.5) or perhaps just keep it as sqrt(2/7).

Wait, sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) is sqrt(2/7), which is the same as 1/sqrt(3.5), but perhaps it's better to rationalize.

Alternatively, I can compute a and b in terms of complex numbers.

But perhaps another approach is to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>.

Because the probability of measuring |+x> is |< +x | alpha > |², and similarly for |-x>.

Let me compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) ( < up | + < down | ) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7 )

So,

= [ (1+i) * 1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7) ) + (2 -i) * 1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, no, let me compute it properly.

< +x | alpha > = [ ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7 )

So,

= [ (1+i) < up | up > + (2 -i) < up | down > ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

But < up | up > is 1, < up | down > is 0.

Similarly for the other term.

So,

= (1+i) / sqrt(2*7) 

Similarly, < -x | alpha > is [ ( < up | - < down | ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7 )

= [ (1+i) * 1 - (2 -i) * 1 ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

= [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(14)

Simplify numerator:

1-2 + i + i = -1 + 2i.

So,

= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

Now, the probabilities are the modulus squared of these two.

Compute |< +x | alpha > |²:

( (1+i) / sqrt(14) ) * ( (1 -i) / sqrt(14) ) 

Wait, because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 =2.

So,

( (1+i)(1-i) ) / (14) ) = 2 /14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.142857.

Wait, but that can't be right because the probabilities should sum to 1. Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate.

Wait, |a|^2 where a is (1+i)/sqrt(14):

The modulus squared is (1^2 + 1^2) / 14 = 2/14 = 1/7 ≈ 0.1429.

Similarly, for |< -x | alpha > |^2:

[ (-1 + 2i) ] [ (-1 -2i) ] / (14) = (1 +4 +4i*(-1) ) ??? Wait, no, more accurately:

Multiply (-1 + 2i)(-1 -2i) = (-1)^2 + (2i)^2 + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1)(-2i) ? Wait no, better to compute as (a + b)(a - b) where a=-1, b=2i.

So,

(-1)^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - (4i²) =1 - (-4) =5.

Wait, 2i squared is (2i)^2 = -4. So,

= 1 - ( -4 ) =5.

So,

|b|^2 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but 1/7 is approximately 0.1429 and 5/14 is about 0.3571. Adding these gives 6/14, which is 3/7, not 1. That's a problem. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the normalization somewhere. Let's go back.

Wait, when I calculated |alpha>, I found the norm squared was 7, so the state is divided by sqrt(7).

But when I computed < +x | alpha >, I think I forgot to consider that |+x> and |-x> are normalized states as well. Wait, no, because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), which is normalized.

Wait, perhaps the inner product is calculated correctly. Let's recheck.

Wait, < +x | alpha > is [ (1+i) * (1) + (2 -i) * (0) ] divided by sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)? No, wait, that's not right.

Wait, let me recompute < +x | alpha >.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the inner product < +x | alpha > is:

[ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) 

= [ (1+i) * <up|up> * 1/sqrt(2) + (2-i) * <down|down> *1/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Because <up|down> is zero.

So,

< +x | alpha > = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Oh wait, that's because |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when I take the inner product with |alpha>, it's (1+i)/sqrt(2)sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(2)sqrt(7).

So,

= [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / ( sqrt(14) )

Simplify numerator:

1+2 + i -i =3.

So,

< +x | alpha > = 3 / sqrt(14).

Ah, that's different from my earlier approach. So I think I made a mistake in my initial calculation. Oh wait, this makes more sense.

So, the correct < +x | alpha > is 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the inner product is:

[ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7 )

= [ (1+i) * <up|up> * 1/sqrt(2) - (2 -i) * <down| down> * 1/sqrt(2) ) ] / sqrt(7 )

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

= (1 +i -2 +i ) / sqrt(14)

= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

Now, compute the modulus squared for each.

First, |< +x | alpha >|^2 = (3^2) /14 =9/14 ≈0.6429.

Second, |< -x | alpha >|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, that adds up to 9 +5 =14, so 14/14=1, which makes sense. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. So approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Option D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2 hbar /sqrt(7).

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64, so that matches option A's first two numbers.

But let's check the average value of the operator A. The average value <A> is the expectation value, which is <alpha| A | alpha>.

Hmm, since A is the operator with matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 system, the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, then the expectation value is (hbar/2) * < alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

But sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, so < sigma_x > is the expectation of X, which is 2 * Re( <up| sigma_x | alpha > ), but perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, since | alpha > is written in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the expectation value of sigma_x is ( <+x| sigma_x |+x> ) * |a|^2 + ( <+x| sigma_x |-x> ) * a b* + ( < -x | sigma_x |+x> ) * a* b + ( < -x | sigma_x | -x> ) |b|^2.

But sigma_x has eigenvalues +/-1 for |+x> and |-x>.

So sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, sigma_x |-x> = -| -x >.

Thus,

< sigma_x > = |a|^2 (1) + |b|^2 (-1) + terms from cross terms.

But the cross terms would be a b* < +x | sigma_x | -x > + a* b < -x | sigma_x | +x >.

But < +x | sigma_x | -x > is <+x | (-| -x )> = - < +x | -x >.

But < +x | -x > = 0, because |+x> and |-x> are orthogonal.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, |+x> and |-x> are eigenstates of sigma_x, which is hermitian, so they are orthogonal, yes. So their inner product is zero.

So the cross terms are zero.

Thus,

< sigma_x > = |a|^2 - |b|^2.

So,

< A > = (hbar/2) * (|a|^2 - |b|^2 ).

We have |a|^2 =9/14 and |b|^2=5/14.

So,

< sigma_x > = (9/14 -5/14 ) =4/14=2/7.

Thus,

< A > = (hbar/2) * (2/7 )= hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Now, looking back at the options. Option A says the average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and the average is hbar/7.

So the correct option is A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, but let me make sure. The probabilities should sum to 1. 9/14 is about 0.642857 (which is 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places), and 5/14 is about 0.357143 (0.36 when rounded). So option A's first two numbers are 0.64 and 0.36, which match.

So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, given as proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Key Steps:

1. **Normalization of |α⟩**:  
   The given state |α⟩ is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The norm squared is computed as:  
   \[
   \text{Norm}^2 = (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
   \]  
   Thus, the normalized state is:  
   \[
   |α⟩ = \frac{(1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩}{\sqrt{7}}.
   \]

2. **Eigenstates of A**:  
   The operator A has the matrix representation:  
   \[
   A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \hbar/2 \\ \hbar/2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to the Pauli-X operator scaled by ℏ/2. The eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of the Pauli-X operator, which are:  
   \[
   |+x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ + |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{|up⟩ - |down⟩}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

3. **Expressing |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩**:  
   To find the probabilities of measuring |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, express |α⟩ as a linear combination of these eigenstates:  
   \[
   |α⟩ = a|+x⟩ + b|-x⟩.
   \]  
   Substituting the definitions of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, we solve for the coefficients \(a\) and \(b\):  
   \[
   a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]

4. **Probabilities**:  
   The probability of measuring |+x⟩ is \(|a|^2\), and the probability of measuring |-x⟩ is \(|b|^2\):  
   \[
   P(+x) = |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
   \]

5. **Average Value of A**:  
   The operator A can be written as \(A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x\), where \(\sigma_x\) is the Pauli-X matrix. The expectation value of A is:  
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle.
   \]  
   Using the eigenstates of \(\sigma_x\), \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle = |a|^2 - |b|^2\):  
   \[
   \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14} = \frac{4}{14} = \frac{2}{7}.
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probabilities of measuring |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, respectively, and the average value of A is \(\hbar/7\). These results match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
