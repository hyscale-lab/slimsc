Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles equal, which is the case here since alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ ), where a is the lattice constant, and l, m, n are the Miller indices. Oh wait, wait, no, that might not be exactly right. I remember another formula involving vectors or something with the unit cell parameters.

Alternatively, I think the formula for d is d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) )) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing terms. Oh wait, I think the more precise formula for a rhombohedral system is d_hkl = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk(1 + cos α) - hl(1 + cos β) - kl(1 + cos γ) ) ).

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the general crystal formula. The interplanar distance formula is derived from the structure of the crystal. For a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, gamma, the interplanar distance is given by d = 1 / sqrt( (h/a)² + (k/b)² cos²(theta) ... wait, I might be getting confused.

Wait another approach: for a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length 'a', and all angles are the same, say alpha. So the lattice is a cube that's been deformed. So the formula for d in a rhombohedral system (which is a special case of a hexagonal system? Or maybe triclinic? No, wait, rhombohedral is a subset of cubic systems with all angles equal but not 90 degrees.)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall the formula.
