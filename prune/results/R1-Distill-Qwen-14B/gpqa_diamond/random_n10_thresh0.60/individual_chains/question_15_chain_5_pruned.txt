Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanet transits and which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They've been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 orbits much faster.

Wait, their host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but their radii are same. So Star_1 (Planet_1's star) is more massive but same size as Star_2.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by some factor that depends on the orbital distance and alignment.

Wait, wait. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ), but since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so the (1/(sqrt(1-e²))) factor is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The actual probability is more about the alignment.
