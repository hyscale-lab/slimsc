Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. The operator here is P, and I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, but the problem says it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So n is (nx, 0, nz) with nx² + nz² = 1.

I think the operator in question is the vector operator P, which combines P_x, P_y, and P_z. So the operator P along the direction n would be the dot product of the vector operator P and the direction vector n. That is, P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So the operator for P would be nx*P_x + nz*P_z, since the y-component is zero.

Wait, the problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator we're considering is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Each component is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write out each matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So let's write the operator P as n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So substituting in the matrices:

P = (n_x * ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z * ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] + n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] ]

So the matrix inside is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the entire operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

We are to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P|ψ> = (+ħ/2)|ψ>.

Subtracting, (P - (ħ/2) I)|ψ> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So let me write the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I):

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] - (ħ/2) I

= (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

Wait, no. Wait, I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when you subtract (ħ/2)
