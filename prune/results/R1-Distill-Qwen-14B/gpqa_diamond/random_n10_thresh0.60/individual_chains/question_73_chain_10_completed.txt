Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think this through.

So the problem states: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, which way? Because u is the velocity of one as seen from the other's frame.

Wait, actually, if the two astronauts are moving in the same direction, say, the first at 0.6c and the second at 0.5c, then from the perspective of the first astronaut, the second would be moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1 / 0.7 c ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D say 0.14c for relative speed. So that might help narrow things down.

Next, the total energy. In relativity, the energy of a moving object is given by gamma times mc². So each astronaut's energy is their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Gamma for 0.6c is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m_rest. Wait, but the mass is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, the second astronaut has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Gamma for 0.5c is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total is E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches this. Option B says E=4.96, which is lower, so probably not.

Wait, but wait, no, the option C's E is 5.96, which fits. So relative speed is 0.14c and E is ~5.96 mc². So that would point to option C.

But wait, what about the rest mass energy? The problem says "the total energy of the system." Are they considering the combined system? No, each astronaut's energy is considered in their own frame. Wait, but in relativity, when adding energies, you have to be careful about the reference frame. Wait, the energy measured in which frame?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the frame in which the energy is considered. Hmm, but the question says "the total energy of the system." I think the system here refers to both astronauts as seen from the same inertial frame. Like, if they're moving past each other, but in this case, the problem states their speeds in the same direction, but presumably from the same inertial frame.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction—so in the same frame. So that frame is the lab frame, perhaps. So the total energy of the system would be the sum of their energies in that frame.

So in that case, as I calculated earlier, E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 mc², which is about 5.96, so option C.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: v=0.1c, E=4.96 mc² → no, our relative speed is 0.14c.

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 → that fits.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (the faster astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (the slower astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6)(0.5)c^2}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

1. **First astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):**
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

3. **Total energy of the system:**
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
   \]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( 0.14c \).
- The total energy of the system is \( 5.96m c^2 \).

This matches **Option C**.
