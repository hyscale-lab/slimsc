Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and calculating the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I think this is a two-dimensional metric, so we're dealing with a surface in 2D space. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2.

Wait, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. In geometry, the area of a sphere (which has positive curvature) in 2D would be 4πr², but for a pseudosphere with negative curvature, I remember there's a different formula. Or maybe it's similar but involves hyperbolic functions?

Wait, no, wait. The metric is given, so maybe I should compute the area using the metric. The area of a surface can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in a 2D metric is usually sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, but wait, in this case, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. Let me think.

The metric here is written as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy², right? So the coefficients for dx² and dy² are the same, g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, no, the expression is (32)/(4 - ... ) multiplied by (dx² + dy²), so yes, both components
