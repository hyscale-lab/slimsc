Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decays. Let's see what I can remember and figure out step by step.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given, but maybe I don't need to focus too much on that right now. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so that's the key number for figuring out possible decay products.

I remember that for a particle to decay into fermions, the total energy of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. Also, each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than the mass of X, right? Because each fermion comes in pairs when a boson decays, like a quark-antiquark pair or lepton-antilepton.

Wait, but wait—since X is a boson, its decay products have to be bosons or fermions. Well, since the interaction term is with fermions, like the Lagrangian has ψ_f, which are fermion fields, X must decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the possible decay channels are X → fermion + antifermion. Now, I need to consider which fermions have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list the fermion masses I remember:

Quarks:
- Up and Down (u, d): around 2-5 MeV each. So combined, 4-10 MeV.
- Strange (s): about 100 MeV each. Combined about 200 MeV.
- Charm (c): around 1.5 GeV each. So 3 GeV total.
- Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV each. So 9 GeV total. Wait, that's higher than 6 GeV. So b quarks' combined mass is 9 GeV, which is more than 6, so X can't decay into b b-bar.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for the fermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to X's mass. Because in the rest frame of X, the energy available is 6 GeV, so each particle can't have a rest mass higher than 3 GeV, right?

Wait, no, because the rest masses add up. So if the X is at rest and decays into a pair, each fermion's rest mass plus antifermion's rest mass must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but for each fermion pair, the sum of their rest masses must be less than X's mass. Because in the center-of-mass frame, each gets half the energy. So if the sum of the rest masses is more than X's mass, it's impossible.

So let's check each quark and lepton:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV each. So e+ e- is about 1 MeV. Well under 6 GeV.
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV each. So μ+μ- is about 211 MeV. Also under 6 GeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV each. So 3.56 GeV total. That's under 6 GeV.

So tau pair is allowed.

Quarks:
- Up and Down: negligible, so their pair is allowed.
- Strange: about 100 MeV each. So 200 MeV total. Allowed.
- Charm: 1.5 GeV each. So 3 GeV. 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV, so c c-bar is allowed.
- Bottom: 4.5 GeV each. 9 GeV total, which is more than 6 GeV. So b b-bar is not allowed.
- Top quark: way too heavy, but X is 6 GeV, so top is irrelevant.

So possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-, uū, dđ, sš, c c̄.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about what's kinematically allowed. So any fermion pair where the sum of their rest masses is less than the mass of X.

So looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b quarks have a combined mass of 9 GeV, which
