Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I guess special relativity comes into play here. Oh right, because when speeds get close to the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So I need to figure out how relativity affects the maximum speed.

In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², which all converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point. So the speed would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. This question is relativistic, so that approach might not work.

Relativistic mechanics involves the use of the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). At high speeds, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore; it's (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy of the oscillator isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential in the classical way.

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, energy is quantized in quanta, but this problem doesn't mention quantum
