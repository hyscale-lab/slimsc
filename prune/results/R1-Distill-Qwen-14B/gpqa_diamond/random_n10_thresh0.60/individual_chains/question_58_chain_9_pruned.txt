Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—those are situations where calculations give infinite results, which isn't physically meaningful. Regularization introduces a temporary cutoff or some other method to make the math manageable, and then you usually remove it later with renormalization.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this regularization at high energies. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a bit different from the usual particle-based theories. Strings are supposed to be the fundamental building blocks, not point particles. Since it's a theory that attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, perhaps it's a candidate for being finite or not requiring regularization. Because in string theory, the interactions are different—maybe the perturbative expansions don't lead to the same divergences as in, say, QED or QCD. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's inherently free from certain divergences.

Option B: QCD. Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, and perturbation theory works. But wait, does it still require regularization? I'm pretty sure that QCD calculations, especially loop calculations, can lead to divergences. So regularization is used here, like using lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So B probably requires regularization.

Option C: QED. Quantum Electrodynamics is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that QED has issues with divergences. The calculation of things like the electron self-energy leads to infinities, which is why renormalization is necessary. But renormalization comes after regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization techniques. So option C is out.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the non-quantum version. Classical theories don't have the same issues with infinities as quantum ones. For example, in Maxwell's theory, you can have things like the self-force on a
