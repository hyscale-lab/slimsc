Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

Wait, what's a density matrix look like? For a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The standard basis states are |0> and |1>, so let me write that out. The given ρ is (1/2) multiplied by the sum of |0><0| and |1><1|. 

Expanding each term: |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (1,1). So when you add them, the diagonal elements become 1 each. Then multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element is 1/2. The off-diagonal elements are zero because |0><0| and |1><1| don't contribute anything there. So the matrix ρ looks like:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

I think this is a maximally mixed state. Because the diagonal elements are equal, and the off-diagonal are zero. For a qubit, the maximally mixed state is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is exactly what's given here.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how that maps. I remember that the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch sphere's coordinates are given by a vector (x, y, z), where the state is represented as (x, y, z) with x = <σx>, y = <σy>, z = <σz>, where σ represents the Pauli matrices. For any state, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices give the Bloch vector components.

Wait, the density matrix ρ can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (rx, ry, rz), and σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express ρ in that form, then the vector r would be (rx, ry, rz).

Given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute this. 

The identity matrix I for a qubit is [[1,0],[0,1]]. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. 

So I + σz would be [[2,0],[0,0]], right? Because σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so I + σz becomes [[2,0],[0,0]]. If I take (I + σz)/2, that's [[1,0],[0,0]], which is |0><0|. 

Wait, but our ρ
