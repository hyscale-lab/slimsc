Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh, I think it refers to the excitation energy or the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I remember that the Boltzmann distribution explains the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two states is equal to the exponential of (-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So the excitation here is about the ratio of populations. Let me think. If the excitation is twice as high in star_1, then the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or a lower state) is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited." Maybe it means the number of excited atoms is twice that in star_2. Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

Wait, the exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited... when compared to star_2." So the excitation level is twice. So maybe the ratio for star 1 is higher. So for a given energy level, the number
