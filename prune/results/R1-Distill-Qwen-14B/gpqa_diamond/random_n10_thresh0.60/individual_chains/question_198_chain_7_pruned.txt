Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. 

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think the blue ones have two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ or something like that. 

Wait, the problem gives me the β values for four different complexes. Let me list them out:
β1 = 9 (probably the first complex, maybe [CoSCN]^+),
β2 =40,
β3=63,
β4=16.

Wait, I'm a bit confused because usually, the order matters. Oh right, β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, which would be [Co(SCN)]^+, right? Because each β represents the formation step. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- maybe, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} or something. But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think have two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n) complex. Which β applies here? Oh wait, β2 is 40—that's the stability constant for the second complex, which should have two SCN-.

Wait, the problem states the stability constants for the complexes. So the complexes are Co(SCN)_k, where k is from 1 to 4. Each stability constant βk is the formation constant for the complex up to that point.

So for each k, the complex is [Co(SCN)_k]^{(charge)}. The charge would be Co^2+ plus k SCN^- (each SCN is -1). So [Co(SCN)_k]^{2 -k}.

But I'm not sure about the exact charge, but perhaps it's not necessary for this calculation.

The question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (since 2 SCN- would be -2, and Co is +2, so overall charge 0) among all cobalt species.

To find the percentage, I think I need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and then sum them up.

Wait, but wait. The total cobalt concentration is given as 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So I need to consider the distribution of Co species among the different complexes.

This sounds like a problem where I need to use the formation constants to calculate the distribution of each possible complex.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex and then sum the fractions to get the percentage for each.

The general formula for the fraction of each species is (βk * [SCN]^k ) / (1 + sum over all βk' [SCN]^k' ), where k' goes from 0 to 4? Wait, no, the complex is formed stepwise, so for each step, the β is the formation for that step.

Wait, another approach is to consider that the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is β1*β2*...*βn. But
