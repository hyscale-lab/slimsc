Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see if I can break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with a liquid Y, releasing a gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. The product of X reacting with a certain keto acid has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Also, X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, I need to figure out what X is. Let's think about reactions that release a gas and form a precipitate. Maybe it's a reaction between an acid and a metal, like a metal reacting with acid to produce hydrogen gas and a salt. Or perhaps a reaction between a carbonate and an acid, releasing CO2.

Wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That means the molecule is something where the atomic number equals the mass number. Let me think about possible gases. Hydrogen has one proton and one neutron? No, hydrogen usually has one proton and zero neutrons unless it's deuterium. So maybe the molecule is something else.

Wait, another approach: the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for a molecule, each atom in it must have that. Let's consider H2O: no, because each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, but H has 1 each. But the molecule as a whole? No, the question says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, perhaps it's CO2? No, because each C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's ^12C), but O has 8 each. Wait, no, that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the gas is H2. Because each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron, but wait, regular H is just 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Unless it's deuterium, which has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So H2 would have 2 atoms each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each H has same number, but combined, the molecule has 2H, so 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So pro
