Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, which are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So the first thing I remember is that for a quantum mechanical operator, the eigenvector corresponds to an eigenvalue. The operator in question here is the Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2, right? Because each of the components P_x, P_y, P_z look like the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me write down the given matrices to get a clearer picture.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ].
P_y is (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].
P_z is (ħ/2) * [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ].

So each of these is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, right?

The operator P here is the vector operator: P = (P_x, P_y, P_z) = (ħ/2)(σ_x, σ_y, σ_z). So P is a vector of these Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The question is asking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, meaning it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps. Because in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z would have θ measured from the z-axis.

Wait, wait. The direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So it's any direction that has y-component zero. So n can be parametrized by an angle θ in the x-z plane. Let's say n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Alternatively, sometimes people define θ from the x-axis, but I think here, since it's in x-z, θ would be from the z-axis. So that the x-component is sinθ, z is cosθ.

So the operator P·n would be the dot product, which is (ħ/2)(sinθ P_x + 0*P_y + cosθ P_z) because the n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Oh wait, but wait, the direction is in x-z, so the y-component is zero. So P·n = (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z).

So the operator we need to find the eigenvector for is (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z). The eigenvalue for this operator is given as +ħ/2, so we're looking for a state |ψ> such that P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So the eigenvalue equation is ( (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) ) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can factor out ħ/2, so:

( sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, (sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>.

We need to find the eigenvector |ψ> for this matrix.

Hmm. So, the matrix in question is:

M = sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z.

Which would be:

M = [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
       [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait, let me compute that. σ_x is [[0 1],[1 0]], so sinθ σ_x is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]. σ_z is [[1, 0],[0, -1]], so cosθ σ_z is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together:

M = [[cosθ, sinθ],
     [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the matrix M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 (since M |ψ> = |ψ> when multiplied by 1, because when you have (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, then M |ψ> = |ψ>).

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express.

Wait, M is (ħ/2)(sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z) divided by (ħ/2), so when we set M |ψ> = |ψ>, then (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> , which is the condition.

Wait, perhaps I should think of M as the matrix such that M |ψ> = 1 * |ψ>, since the eigenvalue is 1 (since P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> → M |ψ> = |ψ>, where M is (P·n)/(ħ/2) = sinθ σ_x + cosθ σ_z.

So our equation is M |ψ> = |ψ>.

So, the matrix M is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix for eigenvalue 1.

So, the eigenvalue equation is:

(M - I) |ψ> = 0,

where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I = [ [cosθ -1, sinθ],
             [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the matrix M - I is:

[ [ (cosθ - 1), sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] ]

We can find the eigenvectors by solving the equation (M - I)|v> = 0, where |v> is the eigenvector.

So, for a vector |v> = [a; b], the equations are:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0,

sinθ a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0.

These two equations must be satisfied.

Wait, but for non-trivial solutions (a, b not zero), the determinant of the matrix must be zero. But since we're looking for the eigenvalue 1, which we've already assumed, the equations are consistent.

So, let's take the first equation:

( cosθ - 1 ) a + sinθ b = 0.

We can solve for b in terms of a.

sinθ b = (1 - cosθ) a → b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a.

But (1 - cosθ)/sinθ can be simplified using trigonometric identities.

Remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) = tan(θ/2).

So, b = tan(θ/2) a.

So, the eigenvector can be written as |v> = [ a; tan(θ/2) a ] = a [1; tan(θ/2) ].

We can write this as |v> = a [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T ?

Wait, wait. Because tan(theta/2) is sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so [1; tan(theta/2)] is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by 1/(cos(theta/2)).

Hmm, but let me think about normalizing this vector.

Wait, let's compute the components:

If a is a scalar, then |v> is proportional to [1; tan(theta/2)].

But to normalize, let's compute the norm squared:

|1|^2 + |tan(theta/2)|^2 = 1 + tan²(theta/2) = sec²(theta/2) = 1/(cos²(theta/2)).

So the normalized vector becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, because [1; tan(theta/2)] is (1/cos(theta/2)) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So when normalized, it becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Let me compute [1, tan(theta/2)].

Divide by sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) = sqrt( sec²(theta/2) ) ) = 1/|cos(theta/2)|.

Assuming cos(theta/2) is positive, which it is for theta between 0 and pi.

So, the normalized vector would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the signs mixed up. Let me think about theta being in the range where cos(theta/2) is positive, which is the case when theta is between 0 and pi. That's probably acceptable for this problem.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, let me check the second equation to make sure.

The second equation from (M - I) |v> = 0 is:

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0.

Substituting b = tan(theta/2) a,

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) tan(theta/2) a = 0.

Divide both sides by a (a non-zero):

sinθ - (cosθ + 1) tan(theta/2) = 0.

Let me compute each term:

tan(theta/2) = sin(theta)/(1 + cos theta).

Alternatively, let me compute (cos theta +1) tan(theta/2):

(cos theta + 1) * [ sin(theta/2) / cos(theta/2) ]

But, (cos theta +1) can be written as 2 cos²(theta/2).

So,

2 cos²(theta/2) * [ sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2) ] = 2 cos(theta/2) sin(theta/2) = sin theta.

So,

sin theta - [ (cos theta + 1) tan(theta/2) ] = sin theta - sin theta = 0.

Which holds true. So the first equation gives the correct condition, and the second equation is consistent.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, the operator P·n has eigenvalues plus or minus ħ/2. So since we're taking the positive eigenvalue, the eigenvector we found corresponds to +ħ/2.

Wait, but perhaps the question is phrased as the operator P·n, and the eigenvector is what we found.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

But wait, the options given are a bit different. Let's look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result. But option D is more complicated. Let me look again.

The options are:

A) (√(2/3) ħ, √(1/3) ħ )

B) (cosθ, e^{i phi} sinθ )

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

D) (√(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), √(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but the eigenvector I found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T. So option C is exactly this. So why is there an option D with additional square roots?

Ah, perhaps because I have considered the eigenvector without normalization. Wait, but wait, [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] is already normalized. Because cos^2 + sin^2 =1. So that's the normalized eigenvector.

But wait, looking back, the problem states that the operator is given for P_x, P_y, P_z, each as (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. So when taking the eigenvector, perhaps the actual vectors involve ħ? Wait, no, because the eigenvalue is for P·n, which is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvector is expressed as a vector of components, which would not include ħ, as they are dimensionless.

Wait, but the options A and D have components with ħ. That doesn't make sense, because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the operator P·n is (ħ/2) ( sin theta sigma_x + cos theta sigma_z ), as we established. The eigenvalue is (ħ/2)(+1). So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, as we found.

So the elements are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), as in option C.

But looking at the options:

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches.

But wait, I should also think about possible global phase factors. Since eigenvectors can be multiplied by any phase, but in the options, option C doesn't have any phase factors, but the problem doesn't specify anything else.

Wait, but the problem says "the normalized eigenvector", so I have to make sure the vector is normalized. Our solution is normalized because cos^2 + sin^2 =1.

So, the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but looking at the other options, option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but those coefficients don't seem to come from our calculation. Where could they come from?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial approach. Let me re-express the problem.

Wait, perhaps the operator is not P·n, but the spin operator in the direction n. For a spin-½ system, the spin operator in direction n is (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the eigenvector is written in terms of the eigenstates of the spin in the n direction. The eigenstates of S·n are |+> and |->, which for spin-½ are:

|+> = [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ]^T,

|-> = [ -e^{i phi} sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but in our case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero. Because the direction is in the x-z plane, so the angle phi around the y-axis is zero.

So, phi=0, so e^{i phi}=1.

Thus, the eigenvector for +1/2 is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Which matches option C.

But wait, looking back, the problem statement says the direction is in x-z plane, so n = (sin theta, 0, cos theta), and phi=0. So the eigenvector in the spin-up state along n would be [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

So option C is correct.

But wait, option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors. Why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the x-z plane. Let me think again. Maybe the direction isn't (sin theta, 0, cos theta), but perhaps (cos theta, 0, sin theta), depending on how theta is defined. Let me double-check.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, theta is typically the polar angle from the z-axis. So the x-component would be sin theta cos phi, z is cos theta. So if n is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so x-component is sin theta. So n = (sin theta, 0, cos theta). So that part is correct.

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is option C.

So why is option D present? Let me look again. Option D is [ sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but the eigenvector components shouldn't have ħ because the spinor is a dimensionless vector. So option D includes ħ, which doesn't make sense. Unless I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the operator is constructed. Let me recheck.

The operator P is given as a vector with components P_x, P_y, P_z, each of which is (ħ/2) times a Pauli matrix. So P·n would be (ħ/2) (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z ), which is correct.

So the eigenvalue is (ħ/2) * (+1), so the eigenvector is as we found.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

So why is option D present? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the eigenstates of the spin component along an arbitrary axis, which involves a rotation of the spin-½ state. But in such a case, the eigenvectors are the same as I derived, without any additional square roots.

Alternatively, perhaps the direction n is specified differently, but I think no. The problem says n is in the x-z plane, so phi=0, which is what I assumed.

So, I think option C is correct.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined as $\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})$, where $\vec{\sigma}$ represents the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane can be parametrized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \sigma_x + \cos\theta \sigma_z \right),
\]

where $\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting these matrices, the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} | \psi \rangle = | \psi \rangle.
\]

The eigenvector $| \psi \rangle$ corresponds to the eigenvalue $+1$ (after factoring out $\hbar/2$). Solving the eigenvalue equation, the normalized eigenvector is found to be:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This result matches option C. The other options are inconsistent with the derived eigenvector:

- **Option A**: Includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: Introduces a phase factor $e^{i\phi}$, which is unnecessary because $\phi = 0$ for directions in the x-z plane.
- **Option D**: Includes additional normalization factors $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which do not arise from the calculation.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by option C.

Answer: C
