Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, I remember that electric potential energy has to do with the work done to assemble charges in a system.

So, the problem states that there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, for the calculations, maybe I should just remember that each is 2e.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm trying to visualize this setup. So point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. The other twelve are each 2 meters away from P. So each of them is at a distance of 2 m from P. But wait, since they're identical and all at the same distance, their mutual interactions would contribute to the potential energy as well.

Wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So I think this is the electrostatic potential energy of the system. Since all the charges are the same sign (all 2e), the system's potential energy will be positive because bringing like charges together requires work.

But wait, the system is isolated, so we're considering the potential energy of all the charges relative to each other. So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, another thought: when dealing with multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each
