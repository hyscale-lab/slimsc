Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have rotational and vibrational energy levels. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because in the rigid rotor model, the bond length doesn't change, but the non-rigid one allows for some vibration.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state. But I'm not sure if they're considering just the vibrational or also rotational transitions here.

Let me read the question again. It says the molecule can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, so this combines both rotational and vibrational aspects. But when it comes to photon absorption, usually in spectroscopy, transitions are either vibrational or rotational, but sometimes both. However, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. That might imply the smallest possible energy increase, which would probably be the first allowed transition.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? In the quantum harmonic oscillator model, the ground state is n=0, and the first excited state is n=1. But the rotation-vibration is a bit more complex. The energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model are given by a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

The energy levels are given by the equation E = B J (J+1) - D J^2 (J+1)^2 (vibronic term) + (1/2) h nu (vibrational part?), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be written as E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The vibrational energy is quantized as E_v = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy is E_r =
