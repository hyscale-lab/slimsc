Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible A and B reagents.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let's break it down.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone like that reacts with NaCN, what happens? I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via the Stephen reduction or maybe some kind of cyanide addition. Wait, another possibility: the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh right! The cyanohydrin reaction. That's when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the reaction would add a cyanide and a hydroxyl group across the carbonyl carbon.

So for the cyanohydrin formation, the ketone (butan-2-one) would react with NaCN. But wait, what about the catalyst? Oh, the reaction typically uses an acid, like H3O+ (which is what option A and B suggest for A). So the first reaction's reagent A is probably H3O+.

So that would make sense. So in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and H3O+ would form the cyanohydrin product. So the product would have a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Let's see: butan-2-one has a (CH3)2CO group. Adding the cyanohydrin would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with a hydroxyl and a methyl group on the same carbon. So yes, that's correct. So A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl
