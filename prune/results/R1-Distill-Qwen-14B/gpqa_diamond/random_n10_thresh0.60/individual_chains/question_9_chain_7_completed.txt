Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about molecular symmetry. Hmm, the question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. From what I recall, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a rotation of 120 degrees and have a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis.

Looking at the options, I have to consider each molecule and see which one fits this symmetry.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. Triphenylene has a structure with three phenyl groups connected in a way that the molecule might have some symmetry. But I'm not sure about the details. The substituents might be arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold rotation. Let me visualize it. If there are three substituents spaced 120 degrees apart, that could give C3 rotation. Also, if there's a mirror plane in the middle, that could give the σh. But I'm not entirely certain.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-hexaone. The benzo part is a benzene ring, and the rest is a trifuran. I'm not too familiar with the exact structure, but I think this might have a different symmetry. Maybe C2 or something else. Because benzo groups are usually symmetric, but I'm not sure about the trifuran part leading to C3h.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure is something like B with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are symmetric, each having two methyl groups. So the molecule would have a trigonal planar structure around boron. Wait, trigonal planar often relates to C3 symmetry. Because if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane? Well, in the trigonal planar geometry, there are three mirror planes, each through a bond and the opposite vertex. So that would make it have σh symmetry? Or is the mirror plane considered as the one in the plane of the molecule? Hmm, wait. For C3h, the mirror plane needs to be horizontal, not vertical. In a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are vertical, passing through each C-B bond. So maybe it doesn't have a σh plane. So C3 would be present, but no σh. So maybe C3h isn't there. So triisopropyl borate would have C3v symmetry, not C3h. So option C probably doesn't have C3h.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think. It's like a norbornane structure but with two bridgehead nitrogen atoms. Wait, no, wait. Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic amine. Its structure is similar to norbornane but with a bridge, making it a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis because the three bridges are arranged symmetrically. Does it have a mirror plane? Hmm. If you look at it, it's symmetric in certain planes. Wait, but the C3h symmetry requires a horizontal mirror plane. In quinuclidine, the molecule is not flat, so the mirror plane would have to be in a different orientation. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. But I'm not so sure. Wait, let me think again. Quinuclidine is a convex, rigid structure. I think it has a plane of symmetry that bisects it, but I'm not certain about whether it's a horizontal or vertical plane. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Another thought: quinuclidine's structure is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees, but does it have a mirror plane that's horizontal? If the molecule is like a pyramid, then the base would be a horizontal plane. But quinuclidine isn't a pyramid. Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is in the middle of the molecule. Hmm, I'm not confident about this one.

So going back, which molecule has both a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane?

Triphenyleno... I think if it's something like three substituents arranged around a central point, then C3 is possible. Plus, if there's a mirror plane through the center, that could give the σh. I'm thinking that triphenylene might have C3 symmetry, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is planar, allowing a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, another approach: C3h is a subgroup of the dihedral group D3h. So the molecule would belong to point group C3h. Which of these structures fits that?

Triisopropyl borate: It's trigonal planar around B. The point group is D3h, not C3h. Because D3h includes C3, σh, and other elements. So if it's D3h, then it's more than C3h. So maybe it's C3v, which is different.

Benzo...trifuran: The structure has a benzene ring fused with a trifuran system. The benzene is symmetric, but the trifuran might have a different arrangement. I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Maybe it's D3h or C3h, but I'm not certain.

Option A is the longer name. Triphenyleno...trifuran. So this has a central trifuran ring, and phenyl groups attached at certain positions. If the substituents are arranged such that rotating 120 degrees leaves it unchanged, and there's a mirror plane across the central ring, then it would fit C3h symmetry.

Wait, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... I think the benzo is attached in a way that might give a three-fold symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that one substituent is on each of three positions, creating a C3 axis and a mirror plane.

Alternatively, maybe quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. Let me think about its structure. Quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane with a substituent, probably. Wait, no, quinuclidine itself is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, with one of the bridgehead carbons replaced by a nitrogen. So the structure is symmetrical. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis because the three bridges are equal. Does it have a horizontal mirror plane? I'm trying to visualize it. If you imagine looking along the three-fold axis, the molecule is symmetric in that plane. So a horizontal mirror plane would go through the middle of the molecule. I think quinuclidine does have a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis. So that would mean it has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but earlier I was thinking about triphenyleno...trifuran. If that has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane, then maybe that's the correct one. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe triphenyleno...trifuran has a higher symmetry, perhaps D3h, but the question is about C3h. So if the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no other symmetry elements, then it would be C3h.

Quinuclidine, on the other hand, has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, but I'm not sure if that mirror plane is horizontal. If it's a vertical mirror plane, then the point group would be D3h, but if it's a horizontal mirror plane, then C3h.

Wait, no, in point groups, the mirror planes can be horizontal or vertical. For C3h, the mirror plane is σh, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis. So the C3 axis is along, say, the z-axis, and the mirror plane is the xy-plane.

In quinuclidine, if the three-fold axis is along a vertical line, then a horizontal mirror plane would exist. So when you look from the top, the mirror plane would reflect the molecule onto itself.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine's symmetry is higher, like D3h, because it might have other symmetry elements beyond C3 and σh.

But I'm not entirely certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps triphenyleno...trifuran is the correct one.

Another angle: looking at the options, option A is Triphenyleno..., which has a name that suggests three phenyl groups attached. So if it's arranged so that each phenyl is 120 degrees apart, that would allow for a C3 rotation. Plus, a mirror plane could be present.

Wait, but I'm more confident about quinuclidine's symmetry. If it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it, then it's C3h.

So, putting it all together:

Option D is quinuclidine. If it has C3h symmetry, then D is the answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Quinuclidine's structure is a bridge bicyclic molecule. It has three bridges, each of two carbons. So the molecule is symmetric with a three-fold axis. Now, if you look at it, it has a plane that goes through the middle of the molecule, cutting it into two mirror images. That would be a mirror plane, and if it's perpendicular to the rotation axis, then it's σh.

So I think quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. So the answer would be D, quinuclidine.

Wait, but I should double-check. I recall that quinuclidine belongs to the D3h point group, but maybe that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe it's C3h.

Wait, what's the difference between C3h and D3h? D3h has more elements. D3h includes C3, σh, C2 (perpendicular to C3), and other elements. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, then it has more symmetry elements. If the molecule only has C3 and σh, then it's C3h.

So if quinuclidine has only a three-fold axis and a σh mirror plane, then it's C3h. But if it also has a C2 axis perpendicular to C3, then it's D3h.

Wait, let me imagine the structure of quinuclidine. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, so three bridges each of two carbons. The molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees. Now, does it also have a C2 axis perpendicular to the main C3 axis? If so, then it would be D3h.

Alternatively, if it only has C3 and σh, then it's C3h.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the other options again.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. I'm not sure about the structure. But given the substituents, perhaps it's a tricyclic compound. The benzene rings are attached in a way that could give it three-fold symmetry. But I'm not certain.

Option A is triphenyleno...trifuran. So three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran. If the three phenyl groups are placed symmetrically, that would give a three-fold axis. If there's a mirror plane through the molecule, perhaps perpendicular to that axis, then C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that it has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane. So either A or D.

But since I'm more confident about quinuclidine having a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, perhaps it's D.

Alternatively, the correct answer is A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. Which of these molecules is known for having C3h symmetry?

Hmm. From what I remember, triphenylene has D3h symmetry. Wait, but triphenylene is a planar molecule with three phenyl groups. So it's a symmetric structure, but does it have C3h?

Alternatively, triphenylene has a three-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it, making it C3h. But I'm not sure.

Wait, I think quinuclidine is actually in the D3h point group. Because it has a three-fold rotation axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the three-fold axis.

So if quinuclidine is D3h, then it doesn't fit C3h, since C3h is a lower symmetry. So that would mean another molecule is correct.

Hmm. Now I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about each option's point group.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. Structure: B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So the boron is in the center, connected to three identical groups. So the molecule is trigonal planar around B. The point group is D3h, because it has a C3 axis, three σv planes, and a σh plane. So that would have C3h as a subset, but the overall group is D3h. So it does have C3h symmetry. So if that's the case, then option C could be correct.

Wait, but the question is which molecule "has C3h symmetry". So if a molecule has a higher symmetry (like D3h), then it also has C3h. But the question is about which has C3h. So if a molecule has D3h, it's more than C3h, but it still has C3h. So if the options are about the point group, then maybe option C is correct.

But wait, the question might be about whether the point group is exactly C3h, not a higher symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h, then its point group is D3h, but it also has C3h as a subgroup.

So then, which of these has a point group of exactly C3h?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps none of them have higher symmetry, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options except one have C3h symmetry.

Wait, let me think about each structure again.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar structure. Point group D3h.

Quinuclidine: I think it's D3h symmetry. Because it has a three-fold axis, a horizontal mirror plane, and a two-fold axis perpendicular to the three-fold.

Benzo...trifuran: Not sure. Maybe C3h or something else.

Triphenyleno...trifuran: Maybe D3h symmetry.

So if the correct point group is C3h, then which of these have that?

Wait, C3h is a lower symmetry. So perhaps none of the molecules have exactly C3h symmetry. But that can't be the case because the question implies one does.

Alternatively, perhaps Triisopropyl borate has exactly C3h symmetry, but I thought it's D3h.

Wait, no. Wait, D3h includes C3, σh, and other elements. So the point group is D3h, which is higher than C3h. So if the question is which has C3h symmetry, then perhaps it's not the correct answer.

Hmm. Maybe another approach: Which of the options has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, but no other symmetry elements?

If a molecule only has C3 and σh, then it's C3h. If it has more, it's a higher group.

So, let's think about each.

Triisopropyl borate: has D3h, so includes C3, σh, and C2 (from the D3h group). So it's not exactly C3h.

Quinuclidine: I think it has D3h symmetry, so same reasoning.

Benzo...trifuran: not sure. Maybe it's C3h.

Triphenyleno...trifuran: perhaps it's C3h.

Wait, let's consider the third option, option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure is a trifuran ring with benzene rings attached. The way it's attached might create a three-fold symmetry. For example, if each benzene is attached at every 120 degrees, then a C3 axis exists. Additionally, if there's a mirror plane through the center, then σh exists. So this might be C3h.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is more symmetric, like D3h.

Alternatively, the correct answer is A.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the answer choices.

The options are:

A) Triphenyleno[...]
B) Benzo[...]
C) Triisopropyl borate
D) Quinuclidine

I think the correct answer is D) Quinuclidine, but earlier I was confused about its point group.

Wait, another approach: looking for the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis because of the three equivalent bridges. It also has a mirror plane that is in the middle, which would be horizontal if the molecule is sitting on a surface. So I think it does have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the options, and my reasoning, I'm going to go with D) Quinuclidine as the correct answer.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structural features and symmetry elements. **C₃h** symmetry requires the presence of a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Below is the analysis of each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of a trifuran ring fused with three phenyl groups. The phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically at 120° intervals, which suggests the presence of a **C₃** rotation axis.
- If there is a horizontal mirror plane (σh) perpendicular to the C₃ axis, the molecule would exhibit **C₃h** symmetry. However, the exact structure and symmetry elements are unclear, making it uncertain whether this molecule fits **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule is a trifuran ring fused with benzene rings. While the benzene rings contribute to symmetry, the arrangement of substituents does not clearly indicate a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σh). It is unlikely to have **C₃h** symmetry.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**
- This molecule has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups attached. It has a **C₃** rotation axis and three vertical mirror planes (σv), but no horizontal mirror plane (σh). Its point group is **D₃h**, which includes **C₃h** as a subset. However, since the question asks for a molecule with exactly **C₃h** symmetry, this option is not correct.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative with a nitrogen atom at one of the bridgehead positions. It has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the symmetric arrangement of the three bridges. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σh) that bisects the molecule. These elements match the requirements for **C₃h** symmetry. 

---

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, **quinuclidine** (Option D) is the molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry due to the presence of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: D**
