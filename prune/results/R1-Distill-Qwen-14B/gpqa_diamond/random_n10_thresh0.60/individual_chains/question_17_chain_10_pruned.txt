Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca^2+ pretty tightly. So the Ca-EDTA complex is formed, right? The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Oh, right, because even though the complex is present, some of the calcium might dissociate from it.

They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. Wait, formation constants are for the formation of the complex, right? So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and K is the equilibrium constant for that reaction. K being a large number means the reaction favors the product, so the complex is stable, and the concentration of free Ca²+ should be low.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of free Ca²+ as x. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of each would be x. But wait, wait. Let me think again. The complex is Ca-EDTA, so when it dissociates, each complex unit gives one Ca²+
