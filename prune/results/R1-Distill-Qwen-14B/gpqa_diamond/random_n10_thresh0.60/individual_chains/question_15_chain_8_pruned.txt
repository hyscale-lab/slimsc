Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting their host stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1's period is P1 and Planet_2 is P2 = 3*P1. 

Wait, wait, no, the question says the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter. So, if Planet_2 has period P, Planet_1 has P/3. Oh, right, so P1 is shorter.

Both have circular orbits. So, no eccentricity to worry about. That probably simplifies things.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something? But same radius, so perhaps same size as each other, but different masses.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the higher probability of transiting. So, transit probability is what we're after.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the relative orientation of the orbit. Oh right, the formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the orbital distance? Wait, no, more accurately, the
