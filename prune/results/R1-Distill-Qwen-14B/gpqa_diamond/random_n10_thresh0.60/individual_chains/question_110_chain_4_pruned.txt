Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the capabilities of each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, that's interesting. Wait, no, correction: brighter than 17. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V <=17 can be observed.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, stars with V <=16 can be observed. Because anything brighter than 16 is acceptable.

So the goal is to find stars that are bright enough for both instruments. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). So the star's apparent magnitude must be <=16. Because 16 is lower than 17, so the stricter condition is the apparent magnitude must be <=16 to be detected by both. If a star has V=17, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't. So the star's apparent magnitude must be <=16 to be visible to both.

Wait, no, wait. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it. So that's V <=17. And for HIRES, it's brighter than 16 mag, so V <=16. So a star needs to have V <=16 to be visible by both. Because if it's V=17, ESPRESSO sees it, but HIRES doesn't. So the target stars must have apparent V magnitude <=16.

Wait, but wait: the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". Wait, no, that's not right. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a magnitude brighter than 17 would mean the apparent magnitude is less than 17. Wait, no, no. Wait, the way it's phrased: "brighter than 17 mag can be observed". So if a star's apparent V is brighter than 17
