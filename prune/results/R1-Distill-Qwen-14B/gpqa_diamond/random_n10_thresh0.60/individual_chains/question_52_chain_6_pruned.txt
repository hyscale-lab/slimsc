Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

I remember from my studies that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels depends on the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution formula is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Ã…. Hmm, that's in the ultraviolet range, I think. But wait, if the star has spots, part of its surface is cooler. So when spots are present, the overall average temperature of the photosphere is lower.

But wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the Teff is 5500 K when spots cover 40% of the surface. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. How does this affect the average?

Wait, but the question says that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star as a whole is being observed as having Teff 5500 K when spots are present. So when considering the entire star, the effective temperature is lower, but the spots themselves are even cooler. But perhaps for the purpose of this calculation, we can treat the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star as a whole is emitting as though it's at 5500 K when spots
