Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, let me think. I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible operators that can be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, respecting certain symmetries. But wait, which symmetries are those?

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me break this down.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so any effective theory built from it should too. SMEFT operators must be Lorentz scalars, right? So yeah, Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. So option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But in the SMEFT, the operators are local, so they should respect local symmetries. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The effective operators are built from the SM fields, which already respect Poincare. So any operator in SMEFT should also respect Poincare. But wait, when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they need to respect all Poincare symmetries? Or does SMEFT only require Lorentz because the translations are part of the SM already? Hmm. I think in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetries. But Poincare includes
