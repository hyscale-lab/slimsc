Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I should probably start by recalling what I know about particle physics and decay processes. Let me think.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, with some specific numbers.

Wait, I remember that when a particle is produced, it doesn't live forever. It decays after some time, and the mean decay length depends on how long it lives on average. The mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is about ħ. So Γ, the width, is like the uncertainty in energy, and the mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ.

The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units like GeV·s or something like that. I need to handle the units carefully.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I can calculate the decay length. Decay length L is the product of the particle's velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? The particle is moving at a relativistic speed. Oh right, I can use the relativistic energy relation. The energy E of the particle is related to its mass and momentum. The formula is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So p = sqrt( (E
