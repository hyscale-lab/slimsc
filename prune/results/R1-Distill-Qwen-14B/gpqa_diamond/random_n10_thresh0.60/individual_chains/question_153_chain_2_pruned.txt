Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

So, the question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition. I remember that the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate which then adds to the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Let's take each reaction one by one.

**Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ (A)**

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's a dienophile? Or wait, no. In Michael reactions, the nucleophile is usually the enolate. Wait, dimethyl malonate is a dienolate, right? It can act as a nucleophile because it's a strong base. So, when you have a base like NaOEt, which is sodium ethoxide, it deprotonates the alpha hydrogen of the malonate ester, forming its enolate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. Its structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-... so the p-tolyl is on the third carbon? Wait, wait, let's get the structure right. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but when it's 3-(p-tolyl), the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, that can't be. Oh, wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-COOCH3. Or maybe it's CH2-CH2-C... No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would mean that the p-tolyl is on the third carbon of the acrylate. But acrylate is CH2=CHCOO
