Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky. Let me see if I can break it down step by step.

The question starts by talking about Substance X. It says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Hmm, isotopes are variants of elements with the same number of protons but different neutrons. So X must be an element that has at least one isotope, but it uses a heavier one. Maybe like chlorine, which has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. Or maybe something else. Wait, but the problem also mentions that X reacts with liquid Y violently, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, interesting.

So, gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think. The simplest case is when the molecule is just a single atom, but maybe it has two atoms. Let's see. If W is H2O, then each H has 1 proton and O has 8. But that might not fit. Wait, wait. The molecule must have the same number of neutrons and protons in total. So for example, if a molecule has 18 protons and 18 neutrons, that's H2O wait no. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe W is something like CO2? No, wait. Let's think in terms of individual atoms. Maybe W is something like carbon monoxide? No, but wait, the molecule as a whole.
