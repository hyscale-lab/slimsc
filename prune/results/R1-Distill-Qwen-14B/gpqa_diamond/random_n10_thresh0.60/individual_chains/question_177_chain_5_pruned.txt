Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read the problem again and see what I can figure out.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that probably relates to their temperatures because the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, T would be the same. So T1 = T2.

Now, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, so it's not moving towards or away from us—no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but how does that affect anything here? The question is about luminosity, which is intrinsic brightness. Luminosity depends on the star's properties, not on our perspective. But wait, radial velocity could affect observed quantities like brightness if there's Doppler shift changing the observed wavelength. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, which was probably already accounted for. So maybe the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the calculation of luminosity here because we're using their intrinsic properties like radius and temperature.

The problem says they radiate as black bodies. So the formula for luminosity of a star is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T temperature, and σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both have the same temperature, let's compute the ratio of their luminosities.

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

We know R1 is 1.5 times R2. So (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, the options have other numbers like 2.32 and so on. Hmm, am I missing something?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh wait, but the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 for Star_2. How does that affect the luminosity? Luminosity is intrinsic, but perhaps the observed flux is affected by Doppler shift. But the problem says they computed the luminosities of the stars. So maybe we need to account for the Doppler effect on the observed brightness.

Wait, but L is intrinsic. The observed flux F is related to L by F = L/(4πd²), where d is distance. But if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed flux can change due to the Doppler effect. But in this problem, the radial velocities are given for each star. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Star_1 isn't moving.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the
