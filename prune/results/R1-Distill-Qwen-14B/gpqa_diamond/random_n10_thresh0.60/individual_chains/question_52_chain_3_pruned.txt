Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem then talks about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, so the key here is understanding how the temperature affects the ratio of atoms in different energy levels. I remember something about the Boltzmann equation and the Saha equation, but wait, this is about the ratio of populations in two energy levels, so Boltzmann might be more relevant here.

The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels (say, level 2 and level 1) is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. So the temperature T is lower. Since the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), if T goes down, the exponent becomes larger (since ΔE is positive), making the exponential term smaller. So n2/n1 decreases when T decreases. That's why the ratio decreases when the star has spots.

The question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes. So we're looking for the ratio of (n2/n1) when the star has no spots compared to when it does. That is, factor = (n2_no_spots / n1_no_spots) / (n2_with_spots / n1_with_spots) = [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) ] / [ (g2/g1 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] = exp( (ΔE/(k) ) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, wait. Let me think. Since T1 is 6000 K and T2 is 5500 K. So when the star has spots, the temperature is T2, so the ratio n2/n1 is lower. So the factor is (n2/n1)_T1 / (n2/n1)_T2.

So factor = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) ) * (g1/g2) * (g2/g1)? Wait no, because the g factors (g2/g1) would be same in numerator and denominator, so they cancel. So factor is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) )

Wait, maybe I should write it again. Let me define:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So the ratio when no spots is (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(
