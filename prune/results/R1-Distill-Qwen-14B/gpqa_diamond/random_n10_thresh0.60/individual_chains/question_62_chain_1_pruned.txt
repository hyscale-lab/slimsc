Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which would have a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, there's a substituent at position 1 (which is probably the same as position 6 in cyclohexane) that's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. Wait, cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl would be a CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexyl group? Or is it a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group?

Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexylmethyl group that also has a hydroxyl group. So, the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH2-OH substituent, and that's attached to another cyclohexane ring via a single bond? Or maybe it's a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I can visualize the structure better.

The parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a -CHO group. The substituent at position 1 is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, that substituent is -CH2-OH attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and another substituent which is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group.

So, the target molecule has two cyclohexane rings. One is the main ring with the aldehyde group, and the other is attached via a -CH2-OH group.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That structure is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (-Câ‰¡CH) attached. So, we need to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule.

Let me think about the steps. So, ethynylcyclohexane is an alkyne. I remember that alkynes can undergo various reactions, such as hydration, oxidation, or addition reactions. Let me think about the possible reagents in the options and how they might be applied.

Looking at the options, each has a sequence of reagents, so I need to figure out which sequence would lead to the target.

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq. NH3; O3/H2O; NH4OH.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3/(CH3
