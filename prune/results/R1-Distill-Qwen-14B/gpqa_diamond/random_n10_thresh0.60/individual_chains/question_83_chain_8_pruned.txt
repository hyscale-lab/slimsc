Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titrations and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. I'll try to break it down.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

First, let me outline what I need to do. I think I should start by figuring out the concentration of the acetic acid solution after dilution. Then, I'll determine the equivalence point and calculate the pH there. Then, for the 25% titration point, I'll figure out how much NaOH has been added and determine the pH at that point.

So, initial step: Dilution of acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and concentration is 0.05 M. Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. Using the dilution formula, M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base) should be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the equivalence point first. Let's see.

The moles of acetic acid initially are M * V = 0.025 M * 0.040 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol.

The NaOH is 0.1 M. So, volume needed for equivalence is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the problem asks for two pH points: 25% titration and equivalence.

Wait, 25% of what? Oh, wait, I think 25% of the equivalence point volume. Because the titration is 25% complete when 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence has been added.

So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³ added, that's 25% titration.

Alternatively, another way to think is that at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic
