Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d) in parsecs, right? So p = 1/d. That means a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on where you are in that volume. So if I imagine a big sphere, the number of stars inside it would depend on the volume.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is a measure of distance, so perhaps I need to relate the number of stars to the parallax. Let me consider the relationship between distance and parallax.

Parallax p is in arcseconds. The formula is p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. When parallax increases (like from 1 to 2 arcseconds), distance decreases (from 1 pc to 0.5 pc). So higher parallax corresponds to closer stars.

Now, we're looking for the number of stars per unit change in parallax. Let's think about how many stars exist between p and p+dp. Since the distribution is uniform in space, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell and the thickness. But wait, surface area depends on d squared, and thickness in distance is dr.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a thin shell (like between d and d+dr) would be proportional to the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness dr. But since the distribution is uniform, the number density is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in the shell is n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density.

But parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let's substitute that into the equation. The number of stars in a shell would be n *4π*(1/p)^2 * (dr). But dr is the change in distance, so we need to express dr in terms of dp because the question is about a unit change in parallax.

Hmm, let's see. Since d = 1/p, dr would be the derivative of d with respect to p multiplied by dp. So dr = (dl/dp) * dp. Let's compute that derivative. dl/dp is derivative of (1/p) with respect to p, which is -1/p². So dr = (-1/p²) dp. But since we're considering a small positive change in p, and dr is negative (since p increases as d decreases), but maybe we can just take the absolute value for the thickness.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of p, so we need to express the number of stars as a function of p.

So the number of stars in a thin shell between p and p+dp would be n *4π*(d)^2 * |dr|. Substituting d=1/p, and dr= (-1/p²) dp, the absolute value is (1/p²) dp.

So putting it all together:

Number of stars dN = n * 4π * (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Wait, that would be 4π n (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit parallax (dp=1) would be proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when p increases (meaning the star is farther away), 1/p^4 decreases, which would mean fewer stars, which makes sense because stars are distributed uniformly in space, so as you go farther, each shell has more volume but with same number of stars per volume. Wait no, the number of stars in a shell would depend on the volume, but the number density is fixed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back.

The number of stars in a thin shell (dN) is the number density (n) multiplied by the volume of the shell. The shell's volume is 4πd² dr.

But since we're considering parallax p, where p =1/d, then d = 1/p. So dr = derivative of d with respect to p times dp. dr = (-1/p²) dp. But since dp is positive (we're increasing p), then dr is negative, but the thickness is positive. So maybe I should take the absolute value. So dr = (1/p²) dp.

So the number of stars in the shell is n *4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Wait, that would make dN proportional to 1/p^4 * dp. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dp=1) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but that seems too steep. Let me think again.

Wait, no, let's make sure. The number of stars per unit volume is n. So the number in a shell between d and d+dr is n * 4πd² dr.

Expressed in terms of p, since d=1/p, dr = (1/p²) dp (because dr = -d(1/p) = 1/p² dp).

So substituting, dN = n *4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp = 4π n / p^4 dp.

So the number of stars per unit change in p (dp=1) is 4π n / p^4. So as p increases, the number of stars per unit parallax drops as 1/p^4.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer would be option A) ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because when you look at the distribution in parallax, the number of stars in each parallax bin would decrease as parallax increases, because higher parallax (closer stars) are fewer in number if the distribution is uniform in space.

Wait, but I thought that for a uniform distribution in space (number density n), the number of stars in a shell of radius d is proportional to d^2. Because the volume element is 4πd² dr, so the number is proportional to d² dr. So for a given shell at distance d, the number of stars is proportional to d².

But as d increases, 1/p^2 increases because p is 1/d. So when p decreases, d increases. So the number of stars per unit p would be higher for lower p (because 1/p^4 is larger when p is small).

Wait, so for example, near p=0 (very distant stars), the number of stars per unit p would be very low, since 1/p^4 would be very small. But wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier reasoning. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait maybe I need to think in terms of cumulative distribution. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, consider that in space, the number of stars between distances d and d+dd is n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density.

But since p = 1/d, then d = 1/p, so dd = -1/p² dp.

So the number of stars between p and p+dp is n *4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp.

Which is n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So dN = n *4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit p (dp=1) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer should be A) ~ 1/plx^4.

Wait, but another approach is to consider the volume per unit parallax. Let me think, the number density is stars per cubic parsec. So for a given parallax p, the distance is d=1/p parsecs. The volume between d and d + delta_d is 4π d² delta_d. If I want to express this in terms of p, delta_d = delta_p * (d^2), because delta_d = (delta_p) * (d^2), since p=1/d, dp = -d^{-2} dd → delta_d = -(d^2) delta_p.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Let's see: For a small change in p, delta_p, the corresponding change in d is delta_d = (d^2) delta_p, because p =1/d → delta_p = -d^{-2} delta_d → delta_d = -delta_p * d^2.

But I'm interested in the number of stars per unit change in p. The number is n * 4π d^2 * delta_d.

Substituting delta_d = (d^2) delta_p into this, we get n *4π d^2 * d^2 delta_p = n *4π d^4 delta_p.

But d=1/p, so d^4 = 1/p^4. Thus, the number is n *4π (1/p^4) delta_p. So per unit delta_p (delta_p=1), it's n *4π / p^4.

So again, the number of stars per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer should be option A, 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I've heard that the number of stars per magnitude increases with distance, but I think that's about absolute magnitude and how flux decreases with distance. But in this question, it's about parallax and a uniform distribution in space.

Another approach: Let's imagine a fixed volume. The number of stars in that volume is n * V. But when you project onto the sky, the number per unit parallax would depend on how the volume changes with parallax.

Wait, for a given parallax range, say between p and p+delta_p, the corresponding distance is from d=1/p to d=1/(p+delta_p). The volume of this shell is approximately 4π d^2 delta_d, with delta_d ≈ delta_p * (d^2). Because delta_d = d * delta_p (since d = 1/p, so delta_d = - (1/p^2) delta_p, so delta_d = (d^2) delta_p).

Wait, no, because if p increases by delta_p, d decreases, so delta_d is negative. But when delta_p is small, the volume is about 4π d^2 * |delta_d|.

So the volume is 4π d^2 * (delta_p / p^2) * d^2 )? Hmm, not sure. Maybe another way.

Alternatively, the volume between p and p+delta_p is the surface area at distance d (which is 4π d²) multiplied by the thickness (which is delta_d = d * delta_p / (p^2), since delta_d is (delta_p) * (d^2) because d = 1/p, so delta_d = (d^2) delta_p.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's go back.

If the number of stars in a volume is n * V, and the volume between d and d+delta_d is 4π d² delta_d, then the number is n 4π d² delta_d.

In terms of p, delta_d = (1/p²) delta_p (because d =1/p, so delta_d is derivative (1/p) with respect to p) times delta_p. So delta_d = - (1/p²) delta_p. Taking the absolute value, delta_d = (1/p²) delta_p.

So substituting, dN = n 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) delta_p) → dN= n 4π (1/p^4) delta_p.

So per unit delta_p, the number is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer is option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \) in parsecs: \( p = 1/d \). The question assumes a uniform distribution of stars in space, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( \Delta d \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) and the thickness (\( \Delta d \)). Thus, the number of stars in the shell is given by:

\[
\Delta N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot \Delta d
\]

Since \( d = 1/p \), we can express \( \Delta d \) in terms of \( \Delta p \). From \( p = 1/d \), we find \( \Delta d = -\frac{1}{p^2} \Delta p \). Taking the absolute value for thickness, \( \Delta d = \frac{1}{p^2} \Delta p \). Substituting \( d = 1/p \) and \( \Delta d = \frac{1}{p^2} \Delta p \) into the expression for \( \Delta N \), we get:

\[
\Delta N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{p^2} \Delta p
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta N = \frac{n \cdot 4\pi}{p^4} \Delta p
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \Delta p = 1 \)) is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). Therefore, as parallax increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with the fourth power of parallax.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
