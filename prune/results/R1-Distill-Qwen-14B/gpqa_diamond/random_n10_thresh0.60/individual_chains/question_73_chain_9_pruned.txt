Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. 

Let me read the question again. The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction. Wait, so the problem is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, no, the question says the relative speed. Oh wait, relative to each other, right? So, if I'm astronaut 1 moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from my perspective, how fast is astronaut 2 moving? Wait, no, wait: the relative speed would be the speed of astronaut 2 as seen from the rest frame of astronaut 1, if I'm correct. Or is it the other way around? Oh, right, because relative speed is symmetrical in a way, but the formula takes into account the direction.

Wait, no. Wait, the velocity addition formula is when you have two frames moving relative to each other. If frame S' is moving at velocity u relative to frame S, then the velocity v of an object in S is related to its velocity v' in S' by (v - u)/(1 - (uv/c
