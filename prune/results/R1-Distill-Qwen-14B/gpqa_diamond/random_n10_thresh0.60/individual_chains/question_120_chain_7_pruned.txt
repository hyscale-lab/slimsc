Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a star with a larger parallax is closer, and a smaller parallax is farther away. Got it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think they mean that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars in a certain volume doesn't depend on where you are; it's the same everywhere. So like, the same number of stars per cubic parsec, no matter the location.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does this number change with parallax (plx)? Let's think in terms of variables.

Parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So if I have a parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, I want to find out how many stars are in that range.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Let's denote the number density as n (stars per cubic parsec). So in a small volume dV, the number of stars is n * dV.

But how does this volume relate to parallax? Because parallax is 1/d, so as parallax increases (closer stars), the distance d decreases. So for a given change in parallax dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance, and hence the volume.

Let me set up the variables. Let's say we have a parallax plx. Then distance d = 1/plx. Now, if the parallax changes by a small amount dplx, what's the change in distance dd?

Since d = 1/plx, taking derivative dd = -dplx / plx^2. Hmm, wait, but since we're considering a range, I think we can model it as a thin shell in distance. So the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and multiplied by the thickness gives the volume.

But wait, in this case, the shell's thickness is in terms of distance, but we're interested in the parallax. So let's express dd in terms of dplx. From d = 1/plx, so plx = 1/d. Taking the derivative: dplx = -dd/d. So dd = -dplx * d. But I'm not sure about the sign here, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, maybe the sign doesn't matter. Let's focus on the magnitude.

So, the volume element dV in terms of parallax would be: 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx). Because d = 1/plx, so dd = (dplx) * (1/plx). Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dd = (d (pl x))^-1? Let me think again.

Wait, if plx = 1/d, then d =
