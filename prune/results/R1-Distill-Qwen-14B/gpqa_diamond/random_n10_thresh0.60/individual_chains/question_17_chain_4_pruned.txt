Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the conditions are such that the EDTA is in its deprotonated form and can form the complex effectively. The temperature is 25 degrees Celsius, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The complex formation is what's described here. The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in this solution.

Wait, the formation constant K is given. I think the formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or something similar), and Kf would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, the solution has the complex already present. So maybe it's at equilibrium, and we can use the K to find the concentrations of the ions.

Let me think about the expression. The complex is Ca-EDTA. Let's denote the complex as CaEDTA²- for simplicity. So, the dissociation reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−}) = 5e10.

But wait, the problem says the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Since the solution is ideal, maybe the EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the EDTA^4- is the dominant species. But wait, in reality, EDTA has multiple protonated forms, but the pH is ideal, so maybe all the EDTA is in the form that can form the complex. So, perhaps we can assume that [EDTA^4-] is not changing much, or that any change is negligible compared to the initial concentration.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: when a complex dissociates, the amount of each ion produced depends on K. So, let
