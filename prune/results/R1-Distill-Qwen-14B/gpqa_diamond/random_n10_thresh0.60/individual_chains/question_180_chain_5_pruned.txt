Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Let me read it again.

We have 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So each charge is twice the elementary charge. Oh wait, the elementary charge is e, so 2e would be 2 times about 1.6e-19 coulombs. Right, so each particle has a charge of 3.2e-19 C?

The system is isolated, so no external fields to worry about. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where one charge is, and the other 12 are all 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given in Joules, so I need to calculate the potential energy and express it in J.

Wait, electric potential energy. I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

But wait, when calculating the potential energy of a system of multiple charges, it's the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Oh right, because each pair contributes to the total. So for N charges, the total potential energy is the sum of U for each pair.

In this case, there are 13 charges. The
