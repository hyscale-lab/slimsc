Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I think I need to calculate two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Relative speed in relativity isn't straightforward like in classical mechanics. Oh right! Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. Let me recall... I think it's something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/cÂ²). But wait, wait, that's when one is moving at v1 and the other at v2 relative to the same frame. So if both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed would be v1 - v2 divided by that factor.

Wait, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So from the first astronaut's perspective, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) but I have to use the relativistic formula. Or wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that in the frame of the first astronaut (traveling at 0.6c), what
