Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question involves three separate reactions, labeled A, B, and C, each producing a product. The options are labeled A to D, each giving possible products for A, B, and C.

First, I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually enolate ions. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl acetoacetate type compound. So, it can form an enolate.

Wait, so in the Michael reaction, the enolate acts as a nucleophile. The enolate from dimethyl malonate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure mentally. It has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate). The structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me.

Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the double bond? Or is the substituent at position 3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the double bond. So, if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, maybe the structure is CH2-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3, but that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, the structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the
