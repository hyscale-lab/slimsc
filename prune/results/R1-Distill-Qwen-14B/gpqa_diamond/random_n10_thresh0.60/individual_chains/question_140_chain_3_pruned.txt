Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. There's also something about a reaction with a keto acid producing a product with two oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. Let's start by identifying each component.

First, gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Since each neutron and proton is a nucleon, the total would be 2n, where n is the number of each. So the molecule must be something like H2O, CH4, or maybe CO2? Wait, but the number of neutrons and protons in the molecule should be equal. Wait, no. Wait, each molecule's atoms' total neutrons and protons should be equal. Or maybe each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in each atom? No, that doesn't make sense because, for example, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in its isotope. So maybe the molecule's atoms have the same number of protons and neutrons. Or perhaps the entire molecule's total protons equal the total neutrons.

Wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. Maybe H2O? Let's see: H has 1 proton, O has 8. So H2O has 2 protons from H and 8 from O. Wait, but the total protons would be 2+8=10, and the total neutrons would be H (0, assuming protium) times 2 and O's 8. So 0 +8=8. Wait, that doesn't match. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons total. Not equal.

What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8 each. So CO2
