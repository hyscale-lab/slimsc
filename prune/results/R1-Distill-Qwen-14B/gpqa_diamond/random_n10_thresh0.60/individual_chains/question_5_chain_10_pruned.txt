Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. 

The operator is denoted as P, and they're asking about its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, so P is a vector operator, meaning it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the first thing I need to remember is that for a vector operator, the components don't commute. So the eigenvector of P along direction n would be an eigenstate of the component of P in that direction. Oh right, the operator along n is given by the dot product of the vector operator with the direction vector. So, P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since the direction n lies in the x-z plane, the y-component n_y must be zero. So, the operator becomes P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z. But wait, what are n_x and n_z? Well, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Maybe I can parametrize n using an angle θ, like in spherical coordinates. Let me think, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Or wait, maybe the other way around? Oh, right, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then θ is the angle from the x-axis to the direction, so n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. 

So, the operator P·n is then (P_x cosθ + P_z sinθ). I need to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Each component of P is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, substituting into P·n, I get:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ cosθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + sinθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Let's factor out ħ/
