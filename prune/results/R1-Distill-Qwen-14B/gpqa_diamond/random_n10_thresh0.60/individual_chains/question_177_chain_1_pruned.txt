Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about the luminosities of two stars. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my blackbody radiation, but let's try to work through this.

So, the problem says Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Oh, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. Interesting, but I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here. The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature.

They also mention that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T went up, lambda_max would go down, and vice versa. So T1 = T2.

Wait, wait. So both stars have the same temperature. That's a crucial point.

Now, the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right! The Doppler shift. So the observed wavelengths might not be the same as the emitted ones.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max for both is same? Or the emitted lambda_max is same?

Hmm, I think the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that's the observed wavelength. Which would mean that after any Doppler shifting, they have the same observed lambda_max. So their emitted wavelengths could be different.

But wait, if the stars have the same temperature, their emitted lambda_max (from Wien's law) would be the same. But if one is moving towards us and the other away, their observed lambda_max would change. But in this case, both observed lambdas are the same. Hmm.

Wait, the radial velocities given are for Star_1 and Star_2 as 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 isn't moving towards or away, while Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Oh, but wait, the radial velocity is how fast they're moving towards or away from us. If it's 700 km/s for Star_2, and 0 for Star_1,
