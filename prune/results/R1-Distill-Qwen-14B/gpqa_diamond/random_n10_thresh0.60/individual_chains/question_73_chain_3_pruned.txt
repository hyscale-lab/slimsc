Alright, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about relativistic speeds and energy. So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, okay, so the first astronaut has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c. The second astronaut has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, the question asks for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me break this into parts.

Starting with the relative speed. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit c. So, the formula for relative velocity is u = (u1 - u2)/(1 - (u1 u2)/c²). But wait, I need to make sure which one is the rest frame. Oh, right, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the second astronaut from the first's perspective would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So u = 0.1c / 0.7. 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142
