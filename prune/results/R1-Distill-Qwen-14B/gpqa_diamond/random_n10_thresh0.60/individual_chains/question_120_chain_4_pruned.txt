Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down. So, the scenario is that stars are uniformly distributed, meaning they're spread out evenly in all directions. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (which is abbreviated as plx) changes with plx.

Hmm, parallax. Right, parallax is a measure of how close a star is to us. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a star with a larger parallax is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away. The formula I think is distance (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1 / plx.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So like, if I consider a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density is the same throughout space. Number density is number per unit volume. So if I can figure out how the volume changes with distance, I can relate that to the number of stars in a given parallax range.

Let me think about how parallax relates to volume. Parallax decreases as distance increases. So for a given parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, the distance would be from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). But wait, when plx is small (far away stars), the change in distance isn't linear because of the 1/x relation. Maybe I should approach it differently.

The number of stars in a thin shell between distance r and r + dr would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So if the number density is n, then the number of stars is n * 4π r² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the volume equation. The volume element in terms of parallax would involve dr, but since r = 1/plx, dr = -d(plx)/(plx^2). Wait, actually, when plx increases, r decreases. Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

So, the number of stars dN in a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx is equal
