Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem has two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with sodium cyanide (NaCN) and a reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which reacts with another reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, the question is about identifying the correct reagents A and B from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations for A and B.

Let me break this down into the two reactions separately.

First Reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions under certain conditions. I'm a bit rusty, but I think substitution reactions with ketones usually involve some kind of enolate formation. Wait, but maybe it's a nucleophilic addition? Or perhaps it's a case where the ketone undergoes a substitution.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, under what conditions does that happen? Oh, wait, I think that when a ketone is treated with a strong base, it can form an enolate. The enolate can then attack a cyanide ion. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the carbonyl.

Wait, but in the product, we have a hydroxy group adjacent to the nitrile. Let me look at the product structure: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be NC-C(CH2CH3)(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe it's like CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CN? Hmm, no, perhaps it's better to draw the structure.

Butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. Reacting with NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)-CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is more like CH(CH2CH3)(OH)C-C≡N. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with cyanide, perhaps it's an addition reaction, but wait, the product has an -OH group and a nitrile. So maybe it's an addition of hydroxyl cyanide or some such. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a nitrile group, but I don't think that's possible directly.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a case of the cyanide acting as a nucleophile in a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced. But I don't think ketones typically undergo simple nucleophilic substitution; that's more for aldehydes or maybe in the presence of a strong base to form enolates.

Wait, perhaps it's a two-step process where the ketone is converted into an enolate, which then reacts with cyanide. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrocyanation reaction, but that's more for alkenes, I think.

Wait, another approach: let's consider what reagent A could be. The options for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is acidic, and NaHSO3 is a source of HSO3^- which is a weak acid, but in solution, it provides H+ and HSO3^-.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl, followed by some protonation or elimination.

Wait, but typically, nucleophilic addition to ketones requires some activation. Maybe the cyanide ion adds to the carbonyl carbon, forming an intermediate which then gets protonated. But then, where does the hydroxyl group come from?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh wait! Cyanohydrin formation. Yes! That's it. The reaction of a ketone with HCN (or cyan
