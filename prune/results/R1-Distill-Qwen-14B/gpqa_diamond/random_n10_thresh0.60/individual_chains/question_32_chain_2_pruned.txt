Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. Oh wait, the isotope here would be Li with 3 neutrons. So, the mass number A is protons plus neutrons. Lithium has 3 protons, so 3 + 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

But wait, in the context of colliders, I think they're talking about ions, so maybe they're referring to the charge state. Not sure, but for energy calculation, the mass is key. So I need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

The energy of the collider is the kinetic energy, I think. Or is it the total energy including rest mass? No, wait, the question says "what is the energy of RHIC", which I think refers to the kinetic energy. Or maybe the total energy? Wait, in particle physics, when they talk about energy of colliders, they usually mean the kinetic energy per particle. Because the rest mass energy is much smaller compared to the kinetic energy in high-energy colliders. But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll proceed and see.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy. The total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) times the rest mass energy.

The problem asks for the energy (presumably kinetic) of the nucleus.
