Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are traveling at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, when dealing with velocities, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. And for the total energy, I think it's the sum of their relativistic energies.

Wait, but wait! The relativistic velocity addition formula is for when you're changing frames. So if both astronauts are moving in the same direction relative to an observer, how do their speeds compare from each other's perspective? Or wait, no—wait, the question is about the relative speed between them. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, what is the speed of B relative to A?

Oh wait, no, that's not right. Because in relativity, the relative velocity isn't just a simple subtraction. So the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (which is the other astronaut's speed as seen from the original frame).

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's say the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what is the speed of the second?

Wait, no, that's the other way around. Actually, if both are moving in the same direction in the same frame, then their relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c because of relativity. That's where the velocity addition formula comes in.

So let's pick one frame. Let me pick the frame where astronaut A (2m) is
