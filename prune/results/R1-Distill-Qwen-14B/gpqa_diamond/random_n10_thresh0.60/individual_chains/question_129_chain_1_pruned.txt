Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound E is. Let me start by breaking down the reaction steps and the hints given.

The problem statement says:

- Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
- Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
- Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
- D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

There are also two hints provided. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

First, I'll try to visualize each reaction.

1. A + HCN → B: So A is reacting with hydrogen cyanide. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups in a nucleophilic addition. So A must have a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin of A. Wait, but HCN adds to the carbonyl carbon, making a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, then B would have a primary alcohol and a nitrile.

2. B → C via H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation catalyst. So what's being reduced here? B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a nitrile group. Wait, but nitriles can be hydrogenated into amines. Or wait, H2 with Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds, but nitriles (C≡N) can be hydrogenated to amines (CH2NH2), but under certain conditions, maybe not. Wait, no, when you hydrogenate a nitrile with H2 and a catalyst like Pd, it typically reduces to an amine. So if B has a nitrile, then C would have an amine group. Alternatively, I might have that wrong. Wait, H2 and Pd in a reduction usually adds hydrogen across triple bonds. So for example, a nitrile (R-C≡N) would become an amine (R-CH2-NH2) under such conditions. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.
