Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says we have a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass, and the options are given.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so then the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting those equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical formula. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

Relativistic mechanics uses the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The total energy in relativity is gamma*m*c². But how does that apply here? Let me think.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the oscillation energy. Wait, maybe not exactly. The potential energy in the oscillator is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy E is gamma*m*c², which is the sum of rest energy
