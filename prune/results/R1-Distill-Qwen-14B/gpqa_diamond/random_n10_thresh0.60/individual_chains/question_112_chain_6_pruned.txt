Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation A has elements Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Since it's proportional, I think that means it's not normalized yet. So I need to normalize it first before doing anything else.

Wait, what are |up> and |down>? They're the eigenstates of the Sz operator, right? So they form an orthonormal basis. So any state can be expressed as a linear combination of |up> and |down>.

So the state |alpha> can be written as a vector in this basis. Let me denote |up> as the first basis vector and |down> as the second. So |alpha> is (1+i, 2-i) in this basis.

But wait, the coefficients need to be normalized. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2. Let's compute that.

|1+i| is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

|2-i| is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5), squared is 5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/√7, (2-i)/√7 ]^T.

Now, the next part is about the operator A, whose matrix elements are Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, A would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2,
