Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have a large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems. Each has a particle that's under the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So each particle's wave function is this expression. When they measure the position, none are found outside x=1 and x=3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. That must mean that the wave function is zero outside this interval, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the wave function is given, but the region where the particles are found is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be non-zero only in that region, and zero elsewhere. Because in quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle is proportional to the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So if the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, then the probability is zero too. So that must be the case here.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm. So this is a complex wave function. The general form is: ψ(x) = A * f(x) + B*i, where A and B are real numbers. But wait, the wave function must be normalized, which means the integral of |ψ(x)|² from all x must equal 1.

Wait, but
