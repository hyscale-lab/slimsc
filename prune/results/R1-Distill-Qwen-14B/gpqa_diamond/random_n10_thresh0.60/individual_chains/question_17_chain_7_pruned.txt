Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They're asking for the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable. So, in this case, K is really large, 5e10, so the complex should be very stable.

The problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA. When it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and Y^4− or something like that. The dissolution reaction would be CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−. The formation constant K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex, so the dissociation would have a K equal to 1/(formation K). Wait no, wait. Formation constant is Kf, the equilibrium for Ca²+ + Y^4− ↔ CaY²−. So the dissociation would be the reverse, so Kd (dissociation) would be 1/Kf.

Wait, I need to get this right. The formation constant Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). So when the complex dissociates, it's the reverse reaction. So the K for dissociation would be 1/Kf, which is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. But wait, how is that applied?

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that the dissociation is negligible because Kf is so large. But wait, no, actually, since Kf is large, the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be low.

Let me set up the equation. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since the dissociation is CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−, the concentration of Y^4− would also be x, because each mole
