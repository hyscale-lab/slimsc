Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with molecular symmetry. But let's see if I can work through it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. Wait, C3h symmetry... Oh right, C3h is the point group that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So, the molecule should have a three-fold rotational symmetry and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis.

The options are four molecules. Let me list them again:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

I need to figure out the symmetry of each of these.

First, let's think about what C3h symmetry implies. The molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around the C3 axis, and there should be a mirror plane that includes the C3 axis. So, any structure that's symmetric with three similar parts arranged around the axis and a mirror plane would fit.

Let me consider each option one by one.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate is (i-Pr)3B. I think its structure has three isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. Isopropyl groups are like two methyl groups attached to a central CH2. So, the molecule would have three identical substituents around the boron. So, each isopropyl is like a three-carbon branch. Since all three are the same, it should have a high degree of symmetry.

Wait, but what's the symmetry? For triisopropyl borane (assuming it's similar to triphenyl borane), the structure is trigonal planar around boron. So, it has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical groups. That would give it C3v symmetry, I think. Because the point group for trigonal planar molecules is C3v, which has a three-fold rotation, vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane? Wait no, wait. No, wait: the C3v point group has a three-fold axis, three vertical mirror planes, and no horizontal mirror plane. Because in trigonal planar, if you have three identical groups, you have three vertical planes of symmetry, each bisecting two substituents, but no horizontal mirror plane because the molecule isn't flat.

Wait, wait, but triisopropyl borate, the molecule is (i-Pr3)B, right? The boron is at the center, connected to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is symmetric, so the molecule is symmetric with three identical groups around the central atom. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis (C3), and each substituent is arranged in a plane. But in this case, the molecule is planar, so perhaps it's D3h
