Okay, so I've got this question about stars and excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when we talk about excitation in stars, it's related to the thermal energy and how atoms get excited to higher energy levels. Oh right, this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the number of excited atoms in a particular level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. I think the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. 

The Boltzmann factor formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight. Oh wait, but in this case, since we're told that the energy difference between the levels is known, and assuming the same for both stars, maybe g_i/g_j is the same for both stars. Or perhaps the question is simplifying things by taking g_i/g_j as 1, so it doesn't factor in? I'm not sure, but let's proceed.

So for star_1 and star_2, the ratio of excited to lower state is given. Let's denote the excited state as level 2 and the lower as level 1. So for star_1, the ratio is n2_1 / n1_1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and similarly for star_2, n2_2 / n1_2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

But wait, the question states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think the population ratio (n2 / n1) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n2_1 / n1_1) = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2).

Assuming that g2/g1 is the same for both stars, because it's a property of the atom, not the star. So the ratio simplifies to:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ) = 2.

Wait, let me think. Let me write the equations:

For star_1: n2_1/n1
