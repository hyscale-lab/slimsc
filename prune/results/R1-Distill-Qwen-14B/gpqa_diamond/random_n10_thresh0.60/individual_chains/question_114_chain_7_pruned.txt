Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O, so maybe a hydrolysis step?) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I think the first reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh wait, but with NaCN? I remember that ketones can undergo some kind of substitution under certain conditions. Wait, maybe it's a substitution where the CN- is acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, but ketones usually don't undergo nucleophilic substitution because they're not the best leaving group environments. Oh wait, unless it's an enolate. Oh right, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. But wait, ketones can't form enolates as easily as aldehydes. Or do they?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another possibility: maybe it's a ketone undergoing a substitution. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So, the structure is (CH3)2C=O. If we add NaCN, which has CN- as the nucleophile. So, maybe the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, but that would form an addition product, like a cyanohydrin.

Exactly, a cyanohydrin! So, the reaction is the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group, leading to a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group. But wait, butan-2-one has two methyl groups attached to the carbonyl. So when CN- adds, the structure would become (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure.

2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile: the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, butane is four carbons. So, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, maybe
