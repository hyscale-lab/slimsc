Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that luminosity for stars is often related to their radius and temperature. The formula I recall is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature of the star.

Wait, but the problem says they found the same wavelengths where they appear brightest. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same because λ1 = λ2 implies T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the stars' velocities going to affect their observed wavelengths? Because when a star is moving towards or away from us (radial velocity), it shifts the observed wavelengths—this is the Doppler effect. Oh, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So maybe this is considering their rest frames, or maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, which would mean that their actual temperatures are different due to Doppler shift.

Wait, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. The question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So if Star_1 is stationary (radial velocity 0) and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, would their observed peak wavelengths be the same? Or is it their intrinsic (rest) peak wavelengths that are the same?

Hmm, maybe I need to consider the Doppler shift here. Because if Star_2 is moving away, its
