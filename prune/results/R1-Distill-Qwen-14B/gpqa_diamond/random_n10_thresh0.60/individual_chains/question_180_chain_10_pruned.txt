Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, 2e—that's twice the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. But wait, the mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The system is isolated, so maybe energy considerations are about potential energy only.

Now, there are 12 charges constrained to stay 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Hmm, I'm trying to visualize this. So, the 13th is at P, and the other 12 are each placed on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P, but their exact positions might not matter if they're all identical and symmetrically placed.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Since all the charges are identical, they're all either positive or negative. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the sign. Hmm, but 2e—could be positive or negative. Wait, but in terms of potential energy, the sign matters because it affects whether the potential is positive or negative.

Wait, but when calculating potential energy between charges, the formula is (k * q1 * q2)/r. So each pair contributes a certain
