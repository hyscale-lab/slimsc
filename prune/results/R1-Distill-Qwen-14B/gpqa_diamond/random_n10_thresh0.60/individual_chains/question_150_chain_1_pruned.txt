Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. 

First, I need to look at the molecular formula and the NMR data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which could be a combination of rings and double bonds. 

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a strong peak, maybe an aldehyde proton? Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as a triplet if it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, but the splitting is a triplet, so maybe it's next to a CH2 (two protons), which would cause the triplet. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic proton, but that seems less likely because aromatic protons are usually downfield but not that high unless there's electron withdrawal.

Then at 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That sounds like para-substituted aromatic protons. Similarly, 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. So maybe two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H, which suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two substituents at the para positions, but wait, wait. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with two substituents in para positions. But wait, let me think about the other peaks.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests perhaps some exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, that's 2H. Alternatively, it could be protons adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a conjugated system. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton next to an oxygen, like in an enol or something.

3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2 or CH2O. The triplet at 9.72 ppm could be adjacent to this CH2. So maybe the structure has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 peak) attached to a CH2 that's connected to something else.

Putting
