Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem here. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question describes three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C. I need to determine the products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is also called a Michael acceptor. The nucleophile here is the enolate from the malonate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because its enolate is stabilized. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it forms an enolate, the negative charge is on the beta carbon, which is the one attached to the carbonyl groups. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Looking at the other reactant, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, its structure is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the acrylate (CH2=CHCOO-) group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but substituted at the 3-position with a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but the substituent is at the gamma position? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is on the third carbon? Or perhaps it's CH2=C(C6H4-4-CH3)CO2Me? I think that's right. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl group is on C2. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O
