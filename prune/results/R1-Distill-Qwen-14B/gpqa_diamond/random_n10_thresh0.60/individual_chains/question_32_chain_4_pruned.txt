Okay, so I have this physics problem here. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus here must be moving at a relativistic speed.

The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the atomic number of Li is 3. But wait, if it's Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes 6 nucleons in total. So the nucleus is Li-6, which is a carbon-12 isotope? No, wait, Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so Li-6.

So the mass number A is 6. Now, the mass of the nucleus would be the mass of Li-6. But wait, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its individual nucleons because of the binding energy, but maybe for this problem, we can approximate it as the sum of the masses. Or maybe use the atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy E0 is mc². So I need to find the rest mass of the nucleus, then compute the total energy when it's moving at 0.96c.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². But in this case, the problem is asking for the total energy, I think. Because the question says "energy of the RHIC". So I think I'm to compute the total energy, which includes both rest mass and kinetic.

The speed v is given as 0.96c. So I need to compute gamma for v=0.96c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that.

Let me compute v²/c²: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Because 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

Now, the next thing is to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 would be needed. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by 6, but wait, that's
