Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty on my acid-base chemistry, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, let me break this down. First, diluting the acetic acid. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we're adding an equal volume of water. So the concentration will drop because of dilution. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Here, V1 and V2 are in the same units, so they cancel. So M2 = 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is a neutralization: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.

I need to find two pH values: at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me start with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So I can calculate the concentration of this solution and then find the pH.

First, calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.02 = 0.0005 mol. So, since we're titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is moles / Molarity = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L, which is 5 cm³. Wait, but the question mentions 25% titration, which is a quarter of the way to equivalence. So at 25%, we've added 1.25 cm³ of NaOH.

But let's get back to the equivalence point first. At equivalence, all the acetic acid becomes acetate. The solution will consist of the acetate ion in solution, which is a weak base. So the solution will be basic, and we can calculate the pH using the Kb of acetate.

The Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, at equivalence, the solution is a buffer
