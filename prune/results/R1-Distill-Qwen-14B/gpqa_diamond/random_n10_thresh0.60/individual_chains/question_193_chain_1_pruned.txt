Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r, like r squared, r cubed, etc.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Wait, right, the parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/d, that becomes N proportional to (1/(1/d))^5, which simplifies to d^5. Wait, wait, let me make sure. 1 over (1/d) is d. So (d)^5. So N ‚àù d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's about the differential change, like how many stars are there per unit distance. Or maybe the number density as a function of r.

Wait, the number of stars in the region varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax decreases, distance increases, and the number of stars increases. But how does that translate into
