Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question involves two reactions, each with specific reagents. I need to choose the correct reagents from the options provided.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each reaction is doing.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. It's reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to form a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, wait. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write down the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a nitrile source like NaCN, I'm thinking about nucleophilic addition. Oh, right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can undergo a nucleophilic attack. But NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which can act as nucleophiles. So, perhaps this is a condensation reaction where the ketone's carbonyl group is attacked by CN-.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The product is a nitrile, so maybe it's a substitution. But ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution unless under specific conditions. Oh wait, perhaps it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, I remember that when a ketone reacts with cyanide ions in an acidic medium, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen gets an -OH group, but in the process, because of the acid, it's protonated.

So the reaction is: ketone + NaCN in acidic conditions â†’ cyanohydrin. So for the first reaction, reagent A is probably an acid. Because NaCN is a source of CN-, but in solution, it would be in the presence of a strong acid. So H3O+ (option A is H3O+), or maybe another acid like H2SO4 or HCl? Looking at the options, the choices for A are H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, wait. Another thought: could it be a hydrolysis reaction? No, because the product is a nitrile. Hydrolysis of a nitrile would give a carboxylic acid or amide, but that's not what's happening here. So it's more likely a cyanohydrin formation. So reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the corresponding butanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

How does that happen? Well, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The common methods are using strong acid or strong base, or sometimes using H2O with a catalyst.

Wait, but in the presence of water and maybe another reagent. Oh, right! The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions, often with heat.

In the presence of an acid, like HCl, the nitrile is protonated, making it more electrophilic. Then, water attacks, leading to a series of steps that eventually form the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, in basic conditions, like with H2O and something like KOH, but the options given for B are HCl and CH3COOH.

Looking at the options, for B, the choices are HCl or CH3COOH.

So, reaction B is with H2O and reagent B. So, reagent B is likely an acid catalyst, perhaps HCl.

Wait
