Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. So, there are a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through B, C, D, and finally E. Also, there are some hints provided, so I'll need to use those as well.

First, let's break down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, yields 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclic ketones, so E is likely a ketone. Let's think about each step and what's happening.

Starting with the first step: A + HCN → B. HCN is typically used in the formation of nitriles, but wait, no. Wait, A reacts with HCN. Hmmm. Oh wait, HCN can add to carbonyl groups. So if A has a carbonyl group, like a ketone, then reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent to each other. But wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol structure but with one OH and one CN group. For example, cyclohexanone would add HCN to form 2-hydroxycyanocyclohexane or something similar, but I'm not exactly sure of the structure.

Wait, but let me think about the next step. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C. So if B is a nitrile, perhaps. Wait, no, wait: HCN adds to a ketone to form a cyanohydrin (which has an alcohol and a nitrile group). But when you reduce that, perhaps the nitrile group is converted into an amine? Or maybe the nitrile is reduced to an amine, but wait, with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but under certain conditions, perhaps they're hydrogenated to alkanes. Wait, no, H2 and Pd (like in catalytic hydrogenation) typically hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds. So nitriles (RCN) when hydrogenated with H2 and Pd would become RCH2NH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is reduced to a primary amine. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the cyanohydrin is a ketone plus something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the first step again. Alternatively, maybe A is a cycloketone, and reacting with HCN forms a nitrile. Let me think: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So, for example, if A is cyclopentanone, then B would be 1-hydroxycyanocyclopentane or something like that. Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced. What happens when nitriles are hydrogenated? Oh, I think they are reduced to amines. So R-CN + H2 → R-CH2-NH2. But wait, another possibility is that the nitrile group is hydrogenated all the way to a methyl group
