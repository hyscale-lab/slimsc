Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors correspond to specific eigenvalues, so this should relate to the spin operator or something similar.

The operator P is given in components. Let me write down each component's matrix:

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, 1] and second row [1, 0]. So that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, -i] and second row [i, 0], which is the Pauli Y matrix scaled. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]], the Pauli Z matrix scaled.

Wait, the operator in question is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is in the x-z plane, which means the angle θ would be measured from the z-axis towards the x-axis. So any direction in x-z can be represented with an angle θ, but phi would be zero since it's in the x-z plane (since phi is the azimuthal angle, and in x-y it's usually considered, but here maybe it's not needed because n is in x-z, so maybe phi is 0 or pi, but the problem says arbitrary direction in x-z, so perhaps it's better to think in terms of a general angle θ from z-axis). 

Wait, but the operator P here is given as components. So the operator along n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. So the operator P is given as a vector operator, and the component along n would be P · n, where n is a unit vector. So P_n = P · n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But in this case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n_y must be zero. Because in the x-z plane, the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if θ is the polar angle from z-axis. Wait, no, wait: in spherical coordinates
