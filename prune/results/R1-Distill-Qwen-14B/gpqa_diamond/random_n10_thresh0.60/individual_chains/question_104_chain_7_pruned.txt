Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The key here is the RV method, which detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us, which is related to the Doppler effect. The formula I think is v = (λ shift) / λ0 * c, where c is the speed of light, but maybe I don't need the actual velocity but the ratio of shifts.

Wait, but how does this velocity relate to the orbital period of the planet? Oh right, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (P * (2π))^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(1 AU) )^(1/3) ) ), but maybe that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses (Neptune), the main factor here is the Doppler shift. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(P)), but since M_planet is much less than M_star, we can approximate this as K ≈ (M_planet / M_star^(1/3)) ) / sqrt(P).

Wait, maybe I should think about Kepler's third law. The orbital period depends on the mass of the star and the semi-major axis. But Kepler's law in terms of velocity? Because the RV method relates to the velocity of the star.

Wait, another thought: the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M
