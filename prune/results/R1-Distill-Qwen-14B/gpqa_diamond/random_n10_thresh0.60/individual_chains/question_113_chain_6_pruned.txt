Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopy data. Hmm, let's go through this step by step.

First, the question provides information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretch is broader than that of alcohols. But another possibility is that it's a carbonyl group with some hydrogen bonding, but that's probably stretching it.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. The 1700 is typical for a ketone or possibly an ester, and the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or maybe an ester with some conjugation. Alternatively, 1650 could be a carbonyl in an aromatic ring, but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe an acid? Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the O-H would be a broad peak. But if the compound is an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1750, but perhaps in this case, it's 1700. Hmm, but then why is there another peak at 1650? Maybe a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in some compounds, like maybe a conjugated ester or a ketone with an aromatic ring, you can have a peak slightly lower than 1700. For example, if it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone, the carbonyl might be around 1680-1700. So maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the 1650 is something else, like a conjugated double bond? Or perhaps a C=C stretch. Because that's
