Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is to the star, the larger the wobble, right?

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the main difference is the Doppler shift observed.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, let me think about the RV method. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is given by K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 AU) ) * ( (1 year) ) ) ) * ( (M_planet) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) ... Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait no, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Another approach: K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (P / (1 year)) )^(-1/3) * (1/(1 AU)) )^(-1) ?

Wait, maybe a better approach is to recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P ) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star^(2/3))

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula that relates K, the velocity semi-amplitude, to the planet's orbital period and other factors.

Alternatively, I think the formula is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i)
