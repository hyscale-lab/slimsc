Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, right? So if it stops, what does that mean for neutrino production?

Neutrinos are produced in various steps of the proton-proton chain. The main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos (νe) from the fusion of protons into helium. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing a lot of neutrinos. Then there are other branches, like pp-II and pp-III. I think the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, perhaps at higher temperatures or densities.

Wait, the question says the pp-III branch stops. So, all other reactions remain the same. So the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) are still active. So the neutrino production from those would continue. But the pp-III's contribution is gone.

Now, the flux of neutrinos on Earth depends on the production rate in the Sun. The Sun's neutrinos have different energies based on which process they come from. For example, the dominant pp-I branch produces neutrinos with energies around a few hundred keV, I think. 

But the question is about two specific bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So I need to think about which processes contribute to these energy ranges.

Wait, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher-energy neutrinos because it involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 ion. The reaction is p + ³He → ²H + νe. The Q-value of this reaction would determine the neutrino energy. Let me recall, the mass of ³He is about 3 atomic mass units, proton is 1, and deuterium is 2. So the energy released (the Q value) would determine the neutrino's energy.

Calculating the Q-value: The mass of ³He is about 3.016 u, proton is 1.007 u, and deuterium is 2.014 u. So:

3.016 + 1.007 = 4.023 u on the left.
On the right, 2.014 u for deuterium, plus the neutrino mass (which is negligible). So the mass difference is 4.023 - 2.014 = 2.009 u. 

1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 2.009 u is about 2.009 * 931.5 ≈ 1875 MeV. That's the total energy released. But in the reaction, the neutrino takes away some kinetic energy. The exact distribution depends on the reaction, but for neutrinos, the average energy is about a quarter of the Q-value? Wait, no, wait. In the case of inverse beta decay (like in beta plus decay), the maximum energy a neutrino can have is the Q-value. But average energies are lower. Alternatively, in the pp-III reaction, the neutrinos have a spectrum with a maximum energy around 17 MeV, I think. Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused.

Wait, the pp-III process produces high-energy neutrinos. The main neutrinos from the Sun are from the pp-I branch, which have lower energies. The pp-III neutrinos are higher in energy. Hmm.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, then the flux from that branch would drop to zero. But the question is about the ratio of two bands: 700-800 and 800-900 keV.

Which of these bands are primarily from the pp-III branch? If pp-III produces neutrinos with higher energies, perhaps around 1-10 MeV, then 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV, and 800-900 keV is 0.8-0.9 MeV. So both are in the lower end of the pp-III neutrino spectrum.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, then the neutrinos from that branch would not be present anymore. So the flux in the higher bands would decrease more than the lower bands. Wait, but if we're looking at 700-800 and 800-900, which are both in the lower MeV range, maybe both are affected.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos have a higher average energy than the pp-I and pp-II. So the neutrino flux from pp-III is concentrated in higher energies. So if the pp-III branch stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like 800-900 keV) would have less flux, whereas the lower energy bands (like 700-800) may lose some flux as well, but perhaps not as much if other branches contribute to that band.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2. So if pp-III contributes more to the higher energy band (band 2), then removing it would lower the flux in band 2 more than band 1. So the ratio (band1/band2) would increase.

Wait, let me think. Before the pp-III stopped, band 2 had some contribution from pp-III. After stopping, that contribution is gone. So the flux in band 2 would decrease. So the ratio band1/band2 would increase.

But how much?

Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the neutrinos in the Sun come from the pp-I branch, which has lower energies. So the 700-800 band may have a flux primarily from pp-I, and the 800-900 band from pp-III. So when pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 drops. So band1/band2 would be higher.

But if the pp-III contributes significantly to band 2, but perhaps less so to band 1, then the ratio would be higher than 1.

Alternatively, if the flux in band 1 (700-800) is almost the same as before, while band2's flux drops, their ratio could be more than 1.

Wait, but neutrinos from the Sun are a mix of different sources. The dominant source is the pp-I, which produces lower energy neutrinos. The pp-III contributes to higher energies. So the 800-900 keV band is in the higher end, so might be more affected by stopping pp-III.

So, prior to stopping, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would have a significant contribution from pp-III. After stopping, that part goes away.

So, the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2 after the pp-III stops.

If band1's flux was not much affected (since it's from lower energy, mainly pp-I), and band2's flux was significantly affected (since it's higher energy and pp-III is a big contributor), then the ratio would be greater than 1.

But how much?

Alternatively, perhaps the majority of high-energy neutrinos come from pp-III. So band2 is mainly from pp-III, which stops, so band2's flux drops, and band1 remains roughly similar. So the ratio (band1/band2) would go up.

Wait, but the neutrino flux from the Sun includes a lot of lower energy neutrinos from pp-I, so band1 might have a lot more to begin with. But when pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos from pp-III are gone, so band2's flux decreases.

So the ratio band1/band2 would be (flux_band1_after)/(flux_band2_after). Before, both bands would have some contribution from pp-III, but band2 more so.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relative contributions. Let me consider that without pp-III, the neutrinos in band2 are now only from other sources, while band1 may have multiple sources.

Wait, but if pp-III contributes neutrinos to both bands, but more to band2, then stopping pp-III would reduce band2 more.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process contributes neutrinos in a certain energy range. Let me check: the pp-III branch has a reaction where a proton captures a helium-3 ion, producing a deuteron and a neutrino. The Q-value for this reaction is about 17 MeV (I think). So the neutrinos from this process have a spectrum peaking around a few MeV, with maximum energy about 17 MeV. So the neutrinos from pp-III can have energies up to 17 MeV, but the average is lower. 

So the 700-800 keV band is 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is much lower than the average of pp-III neutrinos. Hmm, perhaps that's not correct. If the pp-III neutrinos are up to 17 MeV, then 0.7-0.8 MeV is much lower. So maybe the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute much to band1 (700-800 keV), but more to band2 (800-900 keV). Wait, but 800 keV is 0.8 MeV, which is still low compared to the pp-III average.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the pp-III neutrinos are in the MeV range, so 0.7-0.8 MeV is below that, meaning band1 isn't significantly affected by the stopping of pp-III, while band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is either not much affected or possibly a bit.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the energy scales wrong. Let's clarify: 

Proton-proton chain steps:

1. pp-I branch: mainly produces lower-energy neutrinos. Q-value is about a few MeV? Or lower? Let me think: the first step is two protons fusing into deuterium, releasing a positron and a neutrino. The Q-value for that reaction is about 1.4 MeV. So the neutrinos from this step have energies around 1.4 MeV. So the pp-I neutrinos are in the ~1 MeV range, so band1 (700-800 keV, 0.7-0.8 MeV) is just below that. Wait, 1 MeV is 1000 keV. So 700-800 is 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is just below the average for pp-I neutrinos. So perhaps the pp-I neutrinos are around 1 MeV, so their flux is significant in the 1 MeV band, which is band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV? No, 0.8-0.9 is 800-900 keV, which is 0.8-0.9 MeV. So 1 MeV is higher than band2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the neutrino energies wrong. Let me think again. The pp-I reaction (two protons fusing into deuterium) has a Q-value of about 1.4 MeV. So the neutrino's energy is up to 1.4 MeV, with an average around maybe 0.3-0.5 MeV (I'm not certain, but I think the average is lower). So pp-I neutrinos have energies up to ~1.4 MeV, with a spectrum that peaks around lower energies.

On the other hand, the pp-III reaction (p + ³He → ²H + νe) has a higher Q-value. The mass of ³He is about 3.016 u, proton is 1.007 u. Fusing them gives 2.014 u (deuterium) plus a neutrino. The mass difference is 3.016 + 1.007 = 4.023 u, minus 2.014 u = 2.009 u. 2.009 u * 931 MeV/u ≈ 1875 MeV, or ~1.875 GeV. So the maximum neutrino energy from this reaction is about 1.875 GeV. The average energy would be lower, perhaps a few hundred MeV? Wait, that can't be right because that's way higher than what I remember.

Wait, I must be making a mistake. Let me correct: 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 2.009 u is 2.009 * 931.5 ≈ 1,874 MeV. So the Q-value is ~1.874 GeV. So the neutrinos from pp-III can have energies up to ~1.87 GeV, but the average would be lower. So their energy spectrum is much higher than pp-I.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is p + ³He → ²H + νe. The initial kinetic energy of the proton and ³He must be sufficient to overcome the binding energy. But the neutrino's energy comes from the Q-value of the reaction. So the maximum energy is about 1.87 GeV. The average energy depends on the distribution, but I think for thermal protons, the neutrinos from pp-III have energies in the range of a few MeV to tens of MeV. 

So, considering that, the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy than the pp-I. So the 700-800 keV band (0.7-0.8 MeV) is much lower than the average of pp-III neutrinos. So, the majority of pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands, say, 10 MeV and above. Therefore, the 700-800 keV band is mainly from other branches. 

So, when the pp-III branch stops, the neutrino flux in the higher energy bands (like 10 MeV and above) would drop, but the lower energy bands (like 700-800 keV) would have their flux remain roughly the same because they're from other sources (like pp-I and pp-II). 

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of two bands: band1 (700-800 keV) and band2 (800-900 keV). So both are in the lower MeV range. 

If the pp-III neutrinos are typically in higher MeV ranges, then in the bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV (0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 MeV), the pp-III neutrinos don't contribute much. So stopping pp-III wouldn't significantly affect these bands. 

Hmm, but that's confusing. So if the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy bands, then the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands are mainly from pp-I and pp-II. So stopping pp-III would have little effect on these bands. Therefore, the flux ratio would remain approximately the same as before. 

But wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos do contribute a little to these lower energy bands as a tail of their spectrum. So, without pp-III, the flux in these bands would be slightly reduced. But how significant is that?

The pp-III neutrinos have a higher average energy, but their spectrum extends down to lower energies. So, some of the neutrinos from pp-III would be in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV ranges. So, if pp-III stops, the flux in these bands would decrease a bit. But how much?

Assuming that the pp-III contributes a small fraction to the lower energy bands (700-800 and 800-900 keV), then the flux in both bands would decrease, but perhaps band2 (800-900) is more affected than band1 because higher energy neutrinos are more likely to be from pp-III.

Wait, but wait. If the pp-III neutrinos have a higher average energy, then the 700-800 keV band is below their average, so the contribution from pp-III to band1 is probably less than their contribution to band2. Because band2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV, which is closer to the lower end of pp-III's spectrum.

Wait, but that's not right. Because the spectrum of pp-III neutrinos peaks higher, their flux at lower energies (like 0.7-0.8 MeV) is small. So, the contribution of pp-III to band1 is negligible, but band2 might have a very small contribution. So, when pp-III stops, the flux in band2 (800-900 keV) would decrease slightly, but band1 (700-800) would remain roughly the same.

So, the ratio (band1 / band2) would increase because the denominator decreases.

But how much would it increase? If the contribution to band2 is small, the change in flux would be small. Alternatively, if the contribution is large, the ratio would change significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces neutrinos with energies up to around 10 MeV or so, so their tails (low energy parts) might contribute a little to the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands. Let's say pp-III contributes 1% of the flux to band1 and 5% to band2. Then, when pp-III stops, band1's flux drops by 1%, and band2's by 5%. So the ratio would go from (1)/(1+0.05) relative to each other. But I'm not sure about the actual percentages.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in band1 is dominated by pp-I, and band2 is also dominated by pp-I, but with a small contribution from pp-III. So when pp-III stops, both bands decrease a bit, but band2's decrease is more significant because pp-III contributes more to higher energies.

Wait, but both bands are in the same approximate energy range. If the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, their contribution to band1 is negligible, and their contribution to band2 is also negligible. So the ratio would remain roughly the same.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the pp-III neutrinos are responsible for the majority of the neutrinos in band2, but not band1. Because band2 is higher in energy, so more likely to be from pp-III.

If that's the case, then when pp-III stops, the flux in band2 drops significantly, while band1 remains mostly the same.

So the ratio (flux_band1 / flux_band2) would increase because band2's flux drops, making the ratio larger.

But without knowing the exact contribution, it's hard to say. Let's think about the options.

The options are:

A) 10

B) 0.01 (10^-2)

C) 1

D) 0.1 (10^-1)

If the pp-III stopped and the flux in band2 (higher energy) is significantly reduced compared to band1, then (flux1/flux2) would be higher than 1, so option A (10) or C (1).

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is approximately 1, as the two bands are close in energy. But if the pp-III contributes more to band2, then without it, band2 flux drops. So the ratio would be higher than 1.

But how much higher?

If the pp-III contributed, say, 30% to band2 and 10% to band1, then without it, band1 would lose 10% of its flux, and band2 would lose 30%. So the ratio would go from (0.9 + 0.1x) / (0.9 + 0.3x), but I think we need to model it quantitatively.

But maybe a simpler approach is to consider that the pp-III neutrinos are about 1/6th of the total solar neutrino flux. Wait, is that correct? I've read that the pp-III branch is a minor contributor. So, if pp-III neutrinos are about 10% of the total, then when it stops, the total neutrino flux would drop by about 10%.

But how does that affect the two bands?

If the pp-III neutrinos are mainly in higher energy bands, then the 700-800 keV band is not much affected, while the 800-900 keV is slightly affected. So the ratio would be roughly the same, perhaps a bit higher.

Wait, no. The 800-900 keV is higher than 700-800. So if the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy, then stopping them would reduce the higher energy bands more. So in band2, the flux would decrease, and band1 would decrease less.

Thus, the ratio (band1/band2) would increase.

If the pp-III neutrinos contribute, say, 20% of the flux in band2, and 5% in band1, then without them, band1's flux is 95% of initial, and band2's is 80%. So the ratio becomes (0.95)/(0.8) ≈ 1.19. So a ratio of about 1.2, which is close to option C (1) or D (0.1) isn't. Alternatively, perhaps the contribution is more significant.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are a small fraction of the total, the change in the ratio would be minor. So the ratio would be close to 1.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: pp-III neutrinos are a minor component, so their stopping would not change the fluxes in these bands significantly. So the ratio would remain about 1.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to the higher energy bands, so when they stop, band2's flux drops more, making the ratio flux1/flux2 higher.

Another way: the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies in the range of a few MeV to tens of MeV. So, 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) is lower than that, so pp-III doesn’t contribute much to band1, but maybe a bit to band2. So after stopping pp-III, band2 flux drops, making the ratio higher.

But if the drop is small, the ratio would be around 1. But how much?

Another thought: the solar neutrino flux peaks around 0.5 MeV. The pp-I branch neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV. So band1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) is before the peak, and band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is just after.

Wait, but the maximum of the pp-I neutrino spectrum is around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than band2. So band2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV, which is lower than the peak. So most of the neutrinos from pp-I are at higher energies than band2. So what produces neutrinos in band2 and band1?

If the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, then perhaps the neutrinos in band1 and band2 are mainly from pp-I and pp-II. So their fluxes would remain roughly the same when pp-III stops. So the ratio would be about 1, so option C.

Wait, but the pp-II branch produces neutrinos at higher energies than pp-I. The pp-II branch involves the fusion of a proton with a helium-3 ion to produce a carbon-12 nucleus and a neutrino. The Q-value for that reaction is about 5.49 MeV. So the neutrinos from pp-II have higher energies, typically up to ~5 MeV. So their flux would contribute more to the higher energy bands.

So, if the pp-II neutrinos are in higher energies (like 5 MeV), then pp-III neutrinos are even higher.

So, the 700-800 keV band is 0.7-0.8 MeV: perhaps dominated by pp-I, but maybe some from pp-II or pp-III.

So, when pp-III stops, the higher energy bands (like 5 MeV and above) lose their contribution. But the bands 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV are mainly from pp-I and perhaps some pp-II.

Wait, but pp-II produces neutrinos around 5 MeV. So the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands are much lower than that. So pp-II doesn't contribute much to these bands. So, the neutrinos in band1 and band2 are mainly from pp-I.

So, when pp-III stops, which contributes neutrinos to higher energy bands, the lower energy bands (band1 and band2) are unaffected. So their flux remains same. So the ratio remains 1. So the answer would be C) 1.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the neutrino energy distributions.

The dominant source of solar neutrinos is the pp-I branch, which produces neutrinos with energies up to about 1.4 MeV. The pp-II branch produces neutrinos with higher energies (about 5.5 MeV), and the pp-III branch produces even higher (around 17 MeV).

So, the 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV) bands are both in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. So these are lower than the pp-I peak (around 1.4 MeV). So, the neutrinos in these bands are from the lower-energy end of the pp-I spectrum.

But pp-III produces neutrinos in higher energy ranges (like 10 MeV and above), so their contribution to the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands is negligible. So, when pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in the 0.7-0.9 MeV bands would remain roughly the same.

Therefore, the ratio of the flux between these two bands (700-800 and 800-900 keV) would remain approximately 1. So the answer would be option C) 1.


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, typically in the range of a few MeV to tens of MeV, due to the reaction \( p + ^3\text{He} \to ^2\text{H} + \nu_e \). The Q-value of this reaction is approximately 18.75 MeV, meaning the neutrinos from this process have high average energies.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Energy Contributions**:
   - The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with energies up to ~1.4 MeV, peaking around 1 MeV. These neutrinos dominate the lower-energy bands, including band 1 (700-800 keV, or 0.7-0.8 MeV) and band 2 (800-900 keV, or 0.8-0.9 MeV).
   - The pp-II branch produces neutrinos with higher energies, typically around 5.5 MeV, and does not significantly contribute to the 0.7-0.9 MeV range.
   - The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with much higher energies, typically in the range of a few MeV to tens of MeV, and its contribution to the 0.7-0.9 MeV range is negligible.

2. **Effect of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - Since the pp-III neutrinos are concentrated in much higher energy bands (e.g., 10 MeV and above), their contribution to both band 1 and band 2 is minimal. Therefore, stopping the pp-III branch would not significantly affect the flux in these two bands.
   - The flux in both bands is primarily determined by the pp-I branch, which remains unaffected by the cessation of the pp-III branch.

3. **Flux Ratio Between Band 1 and Band 2**:
   - Both bands are in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range, where the neutrino flux is dominated by the pp-I branch. Since the pp-III branch contributes negligibly to this energy range, the flux in both bands remains largely unchanged.
   - As a result, the ratio of the flux between band 1 and band 2 remains approximately 1.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the flux between the two bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) remains approximately 1 because the pp-III branch does not significantly contribute to these energy ranges, and the flux in both bands is dominated by the pp-I branch. 

Answer: C
