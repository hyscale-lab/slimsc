Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and the same goes for their massesâ€”it's 1.5 times larger. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor.

Then, the problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the wavelength where a star emits most strongly is related to its temperature. I remember from blackbody radiation that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature? Or wait, wait, no, because the peak wavelength depends on the temperature. So same peak wavelength implies same temperature.

Wait, wait, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Now, the next part says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Radial velocity... Oh, that's the speed at which they're moving towards or away from us. But how does this affect their observed luminosity? Hmm. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Because the problem involves the luminosity calculation assuming they're black bodies, so perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux or the observed temperature? Oh wait, no, wait. Because the stars are emitting as black bodies, but if they're moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength might be shifted, but I thought the peak wavelengths were the same as determined by spectroscopy. Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is accounted for, so the temperatures are the same.

Wait, maybe I should think about how Doppler shift affects the observed temperature. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, which would make the observed wavelength shorter. But if the star is moving away, it's redshifted, longer wavelength. But the problem says that the observed peak wavelengths are the same for both. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that would cause a Doppler shift.
