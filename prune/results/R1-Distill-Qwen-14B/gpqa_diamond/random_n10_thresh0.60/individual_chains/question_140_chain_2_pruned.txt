Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the problem carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to room temperature, maybe a bit below. 

Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, I'm thinking maybe something like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7, which are strong oxidizing agents, but I'm not sure yet.

Let's break down the information piece by piece.

First, the gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecular weight would be 2 * (number of protons) since each neutron and proton contributes approximately 1 amu. Wait, but in reality, they're not exactly 1, but for the sake of this problem, maybe we can approximate. Also, since the number of protons and neutrons is the same, the molecule is probably a diatomic gas. Common diatomic gases are O2, N2, Cl2, etc. But what has equal protons and neutrons?

Let's think about each possibility:

- H2: Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So not equal. Wrong.
- O2: Oxygen has 8 protons. If it's O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen's atomic number is 8, and the common isotope is O-16 which has 8 neutrons). So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So in O2, each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons, which makes them equal. So yes, that fits.

So gas W is likely O2. Because when you have O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so same number. 

Wait, but another option is if it's a molecule made of another element. Let's see:

Another possibility could be something like D2, but that's deuterium, which is
