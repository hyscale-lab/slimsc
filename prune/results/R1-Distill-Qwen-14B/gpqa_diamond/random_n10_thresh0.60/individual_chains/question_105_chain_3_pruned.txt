Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully and think through how to solve it.

Alright, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, but with some spots on it. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and one hemisphere has these dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When we observe this star, its brightness changes as it rotates because the spots come into and out of view. This can look similar to the brightness changes caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

The question is asking, if there were an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would its radius be relative to the star? So we're comparing the dip in brightness caused by the planet to the dip caused by the spots.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness change (the amplitude of the light curve) depends on the area of the object blocking the light and the difference in brightness between the star and the object. When a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet's radius divided by the star's radius. The formula I recall is (Rp / Rstar)^2. But wait, that's for the case where the star is uniform in brightness. If the star has spots, things get a bit more complicated.

So in the case of starspots, the observed brightness dip isn't just about the area blocked but also about the difference in brightness between the spotted and unspotted regions. Because the spots are darker, when the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the star appear dimmer than usual. But the question says that the spots are on only one hemisphere, so the brightness variation depends on how much of the star's surface is covered by spots and the temperature difference.

Wait, the problem states that the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, the star is a sphere, but if one hemisphere is covered, that's half the star's surface. So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area blocked by spots is 0.2 * (π R²), since a hemisphere is 2π R² / 2 = π R², wait no, wait the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R²? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. The star's total surface area is 4π R². The hemisphere (half the star) has area 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's a hemisphere, the spots cover 0.
