Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, so first, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher beta means a more stable complex. Each beta corresponds to a different complex, right? So β1 is for Co(SCN)_1, β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, and β4 for Co(SCOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution.

So, the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are provided for the different complexes. The β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I think these are the formation constants for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+.

Wait, stability constants usually tell us about the tendency of a complex to form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for the second, and so on.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the order. Let me think. The general formula for the complex formation is Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^2-2n+? Wait, no. Wait, Co is +2, and each SCN is -1. So, for each SCN added, the charge becomes lower.

Wait, no, wait. The complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^{2- n}, right? Because each SCN is -1. So for n
