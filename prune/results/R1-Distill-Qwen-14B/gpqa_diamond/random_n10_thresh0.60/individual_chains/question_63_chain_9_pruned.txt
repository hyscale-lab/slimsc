Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So it's considering both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So for a diatomic molecule, I think this would be the ground state, meaning the vibrational state is at its lowest (n=0) and the rotational state is at the lowest non-zero (like J=0 or J=1?), wait, no, for rotation in the rigid rotor model, the ground state is J=0. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, maybe the approach is a bit different.

Wait, no, the non-rigid rotor model is about allowing the bond length to change due to vibrations, but when considering energy transitions, I think the problem is about absorbing a photon that causes a transition to the next lowest energy state. So perhaps that transition involves a change in both vibrational and rotational energy.

Wait, but the question specifies that the photon causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, so the next state is the lowest energy state higher than the current one. So if the current state is the fundamental (lowest), the next state would be the first excited state, which would involve either a change in vibrational or rotational state.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, transitions can involve changes in either vibrational, rotational, or both. Oh, but I think that in the case of absorption, the photon can cause a transition that increases the energy in either vibration, rotation, or both. But the problem says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the first excited state. So I need to find what that transition is and calculate the photon's momentum.

Wait, but for the fundamental state, the vibrational state
