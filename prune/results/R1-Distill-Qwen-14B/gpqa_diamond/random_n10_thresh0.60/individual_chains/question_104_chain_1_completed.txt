Okay, so here's this astronomy problem I've come across, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again carefully.

So, astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars that have the same mass as each other and similar to the Sun. They found one planet each, both with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits, which probably simplifies some calculations.

The key data points are about the RV method. RV stands for radial velocity, right? So the idea is that the star moves a little bit due to the planet's gravity, and by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum, we can detect the planet.

Planet #1 caused a periodic shift of up to 5 milliangstroms. Planet #2's star showed a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is about how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A to D, with some numbers around 0.36, 1.4, 1.96, and 0.85.

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method depends on the mass of the planet and its distance from the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/1)

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula in terms of the star's velocity. The formula is:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But wait, since M_p is much less than M_star (because Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun's), the denominator simplifies to M_star^(2/3). So, approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Alternatively, another version I recall is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a relation between K and the orbital period. Since K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, perhaps?

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

K = ( (G * P) / (2 π) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since the planet mass is much smaller than the star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, simplifying:

K ≈ ( (G * P)^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( (M_star^(2/3)) * 2 π^(1/3) )

Alternatively, I think I can rearrange this to find a relationship between K1 and K2, the velocities for planet 1 and 2.

Wait, given that both stars have the same mass, M1 = M2. Both planets have similar masses, M_p1 ≈ M_p2. So, M_p1 ≈ M_p2.

So in this case, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) / (P^(1/3)).

Wait, let's write it as K ∝ (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But because M_p is same for both planets (since both are Neptune-like), and M_star is same, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period.

Alternatively, since K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/(K^3).

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K = constant / P^(1/3).

So, K1 = constant / P1^(1/3)

K2 = constant / P2^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Because:

K1/K2 = (constant / P1^(1/3)) / (constant / P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Rearranging,

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K = (some const) / P^(1/3)

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

Which implies P ∝ 1/K^(3)

So, P1 = C / K1^3

P2 = C / K2^3

So the ratio P2/P1 = (C / K2^3) / (C / K1^3) ) = (K1^3)/(K2^3) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, so P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

So the ratio of the periods is (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

If K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1 is smaller than K2. So P1 would be larger?

Wait, no, because if K is larger, the period is shorter.

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K increases when P decreases.

So, for example, if K doubles, P is (1/2)^3 = 1/8 of the original. So, P is inversely proportional to K^3.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, K2 > K1. So P2 is smaller than P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is shorter, that ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, the ratio P2/P1.

From earlier, we have P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because:

P2 = (C/K2^3 )

P1 = (C/K1^3 )

So,

P2/P1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, given K1=5, K2=7.

So,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.714 * 0.714 ≈ 0.51, then *0.714 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, so P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So P2 is about 0.36 times the period of P1.

So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, if P2 is shorter, the answer would be less than 1, like 0.36 times as long. So, planet #2's period is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1's period. So, it's shorter, not longer.

Wait, but the options include A) ~0.36, which would mean P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So, it's 0.36 times longer? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait. If the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1, then if P2 is longer, the ratio is greater than 1. But in our case, P2 is shorter, so it's (0.36) times as long, meaning P2 is 0.36 times P1.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is shorter, then it's 0.36 times as long as P1, which would mean it's not longer. So, the answer would be approximately 0.36, but that would mean that P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, i.e., shorter. But the question is asking how many times longer. So, if the ratio is 0.36, that would mean it's 36% as long, so it's shorter by a factor of about 2.77.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me go back.

The orbital period of planet #2 is how many times longer than that of planet #1? So, it's asking P2 / P1.

But based on our calculation, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So, planet #2's period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So it's shorter, not longer. But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, in that case, the answer is approximately 0.36 times as long. But wait, can the answer be less than one? Because the options include A) ~0.36.

So the question is phrased as "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1." So, if P2 is shorter, the ratio is less than 1. So, the answer would be approximately 0.36. So, the answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait—am I mixing up the ratio?

Another approach: let's think about the velocities. The RV method measures the velocity of the star. The star's velocity is given by:

v = (K) = ( (2π G) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the planet's orbital period.

The period is given by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4π²/G(M_star + M_p)) * a^3.

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate P^2 ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a^3.

But that's for the planet's orbit. The semi-major axis a is related to the velocity. Alternatively, in the Doppler method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (2 pi P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, K ≈ (G M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (2 pi P)^(1/3) )

Rearranging, K ≈ (G M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * P^(-1/3) / (2 pi)^(1/3)

So, K is proportional to P^(-1/3), or P proportional to (1/K)^(3).

So, P ∝ 1/K^3.

So, if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then P1 = C / (5)^3, and P2 = C / (7)^3.

So, P2/P1 = (C/7^3)/(C/5^3) )= (5^3)/(7^3) )= (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So, it's about 0.36 times as long as P1. So, the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times the period of planet #1, which is shorter.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, it's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be ~0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is phrased as "how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means it's not longer; it's shorter.

So the answer is that P2's period is approximately 0.36 times as long as P1's. So, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1, which would be 0.36 times, so option A is the correct answer.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The formula for \( K \) in the radial velocity method is approximately:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Given that the two stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, the proportionality simplifies to:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{1}{K_1^3}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{1}{K_2^3}
\]

The ratio of the periods is therefore:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately **0.36**.
