Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, relativistic speeds mean I probably need to use special relativity equations. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because of the velocity addition formula. I remember that the formula for relative velocity u' when one object is moving at u and the other at v is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait—does that apply when both are moving in the same direction? Yes, because if u and v are in the same direction, then u is the velocity of the first object relative to the second's frame or something like that.

So, astronaut A has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut B has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. So from B's frame, the relative speed of A would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Hmm, looking at the options, which ones have v_rel around 0.14c? Option C says 0.14c, option D same. So that part is either C or D.

Now for the total energy. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy is gamma * m c². So for each astronaut, compute gamma and multiply by their mass and c².

Let me compute each astronaut's gamma.

Astronaut A: v = 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy for A is gamma*mA*c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut B: v = 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

Energy for B is 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96 mc², which is less, so that must be wrong. So the correct answer
