Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But I'm trying to recall... Oh right, in two dimensions, this is a 2D metric, so maybe it's a surface in 3D or something else.

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh yeah, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Like the tractricoid, right? The metric for a pseudosphere usually has a specific form. I think the metric can be written in terms of Poincaré coordinates or something similar.

Wait, the standard metric for a pseudosphere might look like ds² = (dr² + dz²) / (1 + (r²)/(4R²)), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something involving a function like 1/(1 + (r^2)/(4R²)) times (dx² + dy²), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the given metric here is in terms of x and y, not r and z. So maybe it's in isothermal coordinates or something else. Let me parse the given metric.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the line element depends on x and y, and the
