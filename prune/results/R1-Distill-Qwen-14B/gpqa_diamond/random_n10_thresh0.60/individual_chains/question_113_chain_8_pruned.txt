Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound using the given spectroscopic data. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let's break down each piece of data step by step. First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower than the typical O-H stretch for alcohols, which is around 3300-3500. Hmm, could it be something else? Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group, but perhaps in a different environment. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those areas are usually carbonyl groups. A peak at 1700 is typical for a carbonyl like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 could be something else, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, or perhaps an amide? But wait, the problem doesn't mention any nitrogen, so maybe it's another carbonyl group, like an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. Also, the NMR has several peaks, which suggests a molecule with multiple types of protons, but that's not too specific.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. I remember that in mass spectrometry, the most intense peaks are often the molecular ion or significant fragments. The peak at 45 could correspond to a common fragment. Let's think: 45 is the molecular weight of something like (CH3)2O (45), but wait, (CH3)2O is 30. Hmm, wait, 45 is C3H7O? Or maybe a fragment like CH3CO (43, but close). Alternatively, the molecular ion could be 45, but I think more likely it's a fragment. Another possibility is that 45 is from a ketone group or an aldehyde. Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. No, acetone is (propan-2-one), molecular weight is 58. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight for something else. Let's calculate: 45 is C2H5O2? Or maybe C
