Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration and pH calculations. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll work towards calculating both values.

First, I should probably understand what happens when we dilute the acetic acid with water. Dilution usually affects the concentration. So the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. When we add equal volume of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (20 + 20). So I can calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The formula for dilution is C1V1 = C2V2. Here, C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 would be (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1)/(40) = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Actually, wait—acetic acid is a weak acid, right? So when we dilute it, its dissociation might change, but I think for the purpose of initial concentration, it's fine to just calculate the diluted concentration as I did.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So I need to find how much NaOH is added, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of moles.

Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially after dilution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and the concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. So the moles of CH3COOH that have reacted would be 0.00025 mol, because the mole ratio is 1:1.

Wait, but the total moles of CH3COOH initially were 0.001. So after reaction, the moles of CH3COOH left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now has both the weak acid and its conjugate base. This sounds like a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, the pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = approximately 4.73? Let me calculate that. Since 1e-5 has pKa 5. 1.85 is about 1.8, so log(1.8)=0.255, so 5 - 0.255 =4.745. So pKa is about 4.74.

Wait, wait, let me
