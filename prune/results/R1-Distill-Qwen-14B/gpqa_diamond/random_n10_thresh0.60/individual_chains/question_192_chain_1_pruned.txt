Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both l and L are greater than R, and the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So, the point P is outside the conductor. The conductor is uncharged, but we've placed a charge inside its cavity. I remember that when a charge is inside a conducting shell, the shell's inner surface gets an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge, and the outer surface gets a charge equal to the original charge (if the shell is neutral to start with). But wait, in this case, the conductor is just a hollow sphere with a cavity, not a shell. Wait, no, the conductor itself is the outer sphere. So the charge +q is inside the cavity. So, how does this affect the electric fields?

Wait, the conductor is uncharged initially. When we place a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must develop an induced charge. Since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on the outer surface should be zero. Wait, no, let's think again. The conductor is neutral, and the charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have a charge of -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface must have +q to maintain the conductor's neutrality. Wait, no, wait. The conductor as a whole is neutral, so the sum of charges on inner and outer surfaces must be zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q? No, wait. Let me think.

No, wait. The conductor is uncharged. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) must have an induced charge of -
