Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The operator in question is P, and it's given for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The components of P—Px, Py, Pz—are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, eigenvectors for quantum operators... right, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = λ |ψ>. Since P is along a direction n, which is in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented with an angle θ from the z-axis, I think. So n has components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) since it's in x-z. But wait, the problem says it's in the x-z plane, so φ would be 0 or π/2? Or maybe it's arbitrary but within x-z, so maybe the angle is measured from the x-axis? Not sure, but perhaps that's not needed right away.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. So the operator P along an arbitrary direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction's components. Right, because any vector operator's expectation value is the component along n times the expectation value of the operator. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

So since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but each component P_x, P_y, P_z is an operator matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So let me write out each matrix.

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [ [0,1], [1,0] ].
Py is (ħ/2) times [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ].
Pz is (ħ/2) times [ [1,0], [0, -1] ].

So putting it all together, the operator P is:

P = n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Because n is in x-z, n_y is zero, so Py isn't part of P. Wait no, wait. Because the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so n is (sinθ, 0,
