Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. I remember that when dealing with moving media, we have to consider both the refractive index and the motion of the medium itself.

Wait, the setup: the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and it's moving towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them. The light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion.

I think this involves the concept of relative velocity. Oh right, when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium as observed from another frame isn't just c/n as usual. Because the medium is moving, we have to account for that.

Wait, normally the speed of light in a medium is c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, right? Like, because velocities don't just add up linearly when you're dealing with significant fractions of the speed of light.

So the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²), but wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly applicable here because the light's velocity in the medium is not c, but c/n.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The speed of light in the medium is v_light = c/n. But when the medium is moving at velocity v, we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

So the rest frame of the glass (S') would have the light moving at v_light = c/n. The lab frame (S) sees the glass moving at velocity u = v. So using the velocity addition formula.

Wait, but wait. The velocity addition formula is for when you have velocities along the same direction. So if in S' the light's speed is c/n, and the glass is moving at v in the lab's frame, then the lab would measure the light's speed as (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)(v)/c²).

Wait, let me make that more precise. The velocity addition formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²), where
