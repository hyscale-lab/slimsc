Okay, so I have this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms depends on the temperature. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution. 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the excitation level is higher in star_1. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, but the exact number might not matter because the options don't use numbers, they're all in terms of T1 and T2.

Since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), I can use the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the population of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the higher energy level (let's say i) is more excited in star_1. So for star_1, n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 (since it's twice as excited as star_2's n_i2 / n_j2). Wait, no, actually, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state, or something else. Let's think.

Wait, no, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as
