Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving different values for v_rel and E.

Hmm, I remember that in relativity, adding velocities isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Oh right, you can't just add them because it would exceed the speed of light. So I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is: (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, wait, no, that's when one is moving at v relative to the other. Let me get this straight. If astronaut A is moving at u relative to the frame, and astronaut B is moving at v in that same frame, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in this problem, both are moving in the same direction, but in the same frame. The question is about their relative speed. So, from the perspective of astronaut A (mass 2m, moving at 0.6c), astronaut B (3m at 0.5c) is moving at what speed?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So from the lab frame, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So the relative speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1 would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) )? Wait no, wait. Wait, the velocity of B relative to A would be (v_B - v_A)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/(c²)).

Wait, so v_A is
