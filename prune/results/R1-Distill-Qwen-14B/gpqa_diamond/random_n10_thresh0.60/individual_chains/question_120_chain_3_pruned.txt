Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's think.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away, and a larger parallax means it's closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars is the same in each volume element. So the number density is constant.

Now, the problem is asking about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I need to find how N, the number of stars in a certain plx range, depends on plx.

Let me think in terms of distances. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance d: plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. But since dr is a small change, I can think of it as a thin shell.

If the distribution is uniform in space, the number of stars in a volume dV is proportional to dV. So for a thin shell between d and d+dr, the number of stars is n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But we need this in terms of parallax, not distance. Let's substitute d = 1/plx. Then, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dr = - dplx / (plx²). But since plx is a positive quantity, and I think about small increments, maybe I should just take the magnitude for now.

So the number of stars in a parallax range plx to plx + dplx is:

N = n * 4π d² dr

Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = (dplx) / plx² (since dr is negative, but we're considering magnitude here, so maybe just take absolute value):

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) )

Simplify that:

N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/pl
