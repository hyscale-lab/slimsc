Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me read it again and think through each clue.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one it is.

Let's start with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has hydroxyl groups. Like maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid or something with an -OH group.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, which could indicate something else, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, or maybe an amide or another type of carbonyl. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, another thought: the two peaks might be two different carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would explain a lower wavenumber.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H's are the ones in double bonds, like in alkenes. So the molecule must have a double bond, maybe an alkene group. So the compound probably has both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

In the Mass Spec, the fragment peak is at m/z = 45. Hmm, what fragments give m/z 45? Well, 45 is often the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but wait, no, that's m/z 91. Alternatively, 45 could be the fragment for (CH3)2COH, like a ketone with a hydroxyl group. Wait, another possibility: the methyl group from an ester, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a cleavage product. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH2O (formaldehyde), but that's 30. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of C3H7O+? Or perhaps it's the acylium ion, like CH2CO+ (43), but that's 43. Hmm, maybe it's a (CH3)2O group, but that's 45? Wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let's calculate: carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1, oxygen is 16. So (CH3)2O is (2*12) + (6*1) + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46. Oh, wait, so that's 46. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an ester group. For example, if the compound is an ester, like R-O-CO-R', then upon fragmentation, you might get the ester oxygen cleaving, leading to a carbonyl group and an alcohol. Or maybe a smaller fragment.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let's think about degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here.

For C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one DoU could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds or rings.

Wait, but wait: O doesn't affect DoU. So, for each molecule:

Option A: C6H12O2
DoU: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. Maybe a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O: DoU=(2*6+2-10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2: DoU=(14 -10)/2=2. Two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O: (14-12)/2=1. One DoU.

Now, from the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens, which indicates at least one double bond (so DoU at least 1). The FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000, which suggests an -OH group, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the IR, the peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, possibly a carbonyl (like ester, ketone, aldehyde, acid). The 1650 could be conjugated with the carbonyl, perhaps an aromatic ring or another carbonyl group.

Now, if the compound has both a carbonyl and a vinyl group, which options fit? Let's think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: maybe an ester with a double bond. For example, an ester and an alkene. So, like methyl something ester with a double bond. Or maybe a cyclic ester, but that might not have a double bond. Alternatively, could it be a diester? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a diol with a carbonyl? Or maybe it's a hemiacetal, but that would probably affect the IR.

Option B: C6H10O. The formula could be an alkene and an alcohol. But what about the IR peaks? If it has a carbonyl, that would require O, but the formula here has one O. Wait, the formula is C6H10O. So it's either an alcohol with a double bond (but where's the carbonyl?), but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1700. So this option might not have a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde, but then O would be part of the carbonyl, but the FTIR shows a broad peak (OH), so maybe that's a problem. Wait, the IR showed 1700, which is a strong peak, so it's likely a carbonyl group. So this option, B, has only one O, which would be hard to have both a carbonyl and an OH group. Because if it's an acid, the formula would have two O's. Hmm, unless it's a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure. So maybe option B is less likely because it has only one O, but the IR indicates a carbonyl and an OH group, so that's two O's. So option B is C6H10O, which is one O. So that would mean the compound can't have both a carbonyl and an OH group. Because that would require two O's. So option B is probably not correct.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So possible structures: maybe an ester and a double bond, or a ketone and a double bond, or a carboxylic acid and an ether... Wait, the IR suggests a carbonyl and an OH. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond. But wait, a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, which is O2. So that would fit. So C6H10O2 would have DoU 2, so maybe a double bond and a ring? Or a double bond and a carbonyl. Wait, in a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is present, and the -OH is present. Then, where's the double bond? So the structure would be something like CH2CH2COOH, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe it's something like CH2=CHCOOH (but that's C3H4O2), but our compound is C6. So perhaps a larger structure, like maybe a cyclohexene carboxylic acid. But cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond, making DoU 2 (one ring, one double bond). Wait, no, a ring plus a double bond would be two DoU. So the formula C6H10O2 with a ring and a double bond. Hmm, but then the IR would show the carbonyl around 1700, which is what's observed. The broad peak at 3000 would be the -OH of the acid. The fragment in mass spec at 45—could that correspond to something from the acid? Like, perhaps the loss of CO2 would leave something else, but not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU is 1. So, maybe a ring or a double bond. But if this compound has a carbonyl group, which requires O, then perhaps it's an alcohol with a carbonyl. But the formula only has one O. Wait, that can't be. So for example, if the compound is a cyclic ether with a carbonyl, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require two O's, which this formula doesn't have. So the IR shows a carbonyl, which would require O in that group, and an OH group, which requires another O. So this option has only one O, so it can't have both. So option D is probably not correct.

So, back to options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU is 1. So maybe a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which means a double bond is present (so that's one DoU). Then the other DoU would be the ring or another double bond. Wait, no, DoU is 1, so one ring or one double bond. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The DoU for A is 1, meaning one ring or one double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, which indicates a double bond, so that's accounted for. So perhaps it's a molecule with a double bond and an ester group, or a ketone.

But wait, the IR shows a broad peak around 3000 cm^-1, which suggests an -OH. So the compound must have an -OH group.

So Option A: C6H12O2. So two O's. So possible structures: an ester (O in ester group) and an alcohol. Or a ketone and an alcohol, but that would require more O's. Wait, no: for example, R-O-CO-R' would have two O's. Alternatively, maybe a diol with a carbonyl, but that would require three O's. Hmm.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU 2. So maybe a double bond and a ring. So a benzene ring (which would be three DoU, but that's more than 2, so no. So perhaps a cyclopropane ring (which is one DoU) and a double bond (another DoU). So the structure could be something like cyclopropane with an ester and an alcohol group. Or perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an ester. Wait, but the IR has a strong peak at 1700, which is typical of esters. So maybe it's an ester with a vinyl group (double bond). So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOO-R, but that might not fit the molecular formula.

Wait, let's think about each option's structure.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester, the general formula is (R-O-CO-R'). Let's calculate the formula. Suppose R is CH2CH2 (like ethyl group) and R' is something else. Wait, but for C6H12O2, the ester would have:

If R is C3H7 and R' is C3H5O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone, which would have a ring. The formula for a cyclic ester would be CnH2nO2. For n=3, it's C3H6O2. For n=4, C4H8O2, etc. Our option A is C6H12O2. So if n=6, C6H12O2 would be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a formula C6H10O2? Wait, no, wait: a lactone is formed from a cyclic ester. The formula for a lactone would be R-O-CO-O-R' but more accurately, perhaps R-O-CO-R' where R and R' are parts of the same ring. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is not a lactone but a simple ester with a double bond.

Wait, let's think about another approach. The mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z=45. What compounds give a fragment of 45? Let's think. 45 could be a methyl group attached to something. Wait, the fragment could be a (CH3)2O+ ion, but earlier we saw that (CH3)2O is 46. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH2)3O+ which would be 44, no. Alternatively, maybe it's an acylium ion like (CH2)2CO+ which would be 58, no.

Wait another thought: The molecular ion (M) would be the molecular weight of the compound. Let's calculate each option's molecular weight.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight: (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O: (6*12)+10+16=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2:72+10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O:72+12+16=100.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. So if the molecular ion is, say, 116 (A), and the fragment is 45, that suggests a loss of 71. Alternatively, maybe it's a smaller fragment that's part of the molecule. Let's think about what could break off.

If the compound is an ester, perhaps it breaks into an alkyl fragment and a carbonyl. For example, ethyl acetate (which is C4H8O2) would have a molecular ion at 88. Upon fragmentation, it can lose the ethyl group (43) to give the acylium ion (45?), but maybe that's not right.

Wait, ethyl acetate's structure is CH3COOCH2CH3. When fragmented, it can lose the ethyl group (C2H5+) which is 29, or lose the acetyl group (43, which is (CH3COO)+? Wait, the molecular weight of CH3COO is 59 (12*2 +1*3 +16*2=24+3+32=59). Hmm, but 45 is smaller.

Alternatively, think about a ketone. For example, if the compound is something like cyclohexanone (C6H10O), but that's option B. Wait, but option B has formula C6H10O, which is 98. But in that case, the mass spec fragment at 45 would be a small fragment. Maybe a (CH2)2O+ group... no, that's 44. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: if the compound has a benzene ring, but I don't think that's the case here because the IR shows a peak at 1650, which could be a conjugated carbonyl, but not necessarily a benzene ring. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl H's, so an alkene is present. So the structure could be an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, for example. The IR would show a strong peak for the carbonyl (ester) around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might show a peak around 1650.

So putting that together, the compound might be something like methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3), but wait, that's C4H6O2. Our options are C6... So perhaps a longer chain. Like something with a six-carbon chain, perhaps.

But let's get back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 could be the result of losing a larger group. For example, if the compound is a diethyl ester, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment where a CH2CH2O group is cleaved off, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: the molecular formula C6H10O2 (option C) has two oxygen atoms. If the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), then the structure would be a ring with an ester linkage. For example, a six-membered ring lactone would have the formula C6H10O2. Because a lactone is formed from a diol and a carboxylic acid, or from a cyclic ester. So the formula would be CnH2n-2O2 for a lactone ring. For n=6, it's C6H10O2, which matches option C. So if it's a lactone, the structure would be a ring with a ketone-like oxygen. Wait, but lactones are cyclic esters, which would have a carbonyl and an ester oxygen. So the FTIR would show a strong peak around 1700 (the carbonyl), and the broad peak at 3000 would be from an -OH, but wait, lactones don't have an -OH group. Oh, wait, unless it's a substituted lactone with an alcohol group elsewhere. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, another point: the FTIR has a very broad peak at 3000. That's probably an -OH group. So the compound must have at least one -OH. So if it's a lactone, it's possible if there's another -OH group elsewhere. So perhaps it's a diol ester or something. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group, like a glycolic ester or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a β-keto ester. But that might not fit with the fragment at 45.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure of each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures: could be an ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3.

But the molecular formula would be C6H12O2. So, let's count: the ester group is O, so the molecule could be an ester with a double bond, so the structure would have a carbonyl and a vinyl group.

Option C: C6H10O2. Could be an ester with a double bond and a ring, or a di-ester with a double bond. But the O's are two, so maybe an ester and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so double bond is present. So, any option with a double bond is possible.

Now, the mass spec fragment at 45.

If the compound is an ester, upon fragmentation, it might break into an acylium ion. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', then fragmentation could form RCOO+ (the acylium ion), which would have a mass equal to the molecular weight of RCOO. So, for example, if R is CH2CH2, then RCOO would be CH2CH2COO, which is 72 (C3H5O2), which is 3*12 +5 +32 = 36 +5+32=73? Wait, no: CH2CH2COO is C3H5O2, which has a molecular weight of (3*12) +5 + (2*16) = 36 +5 +32=73. So that's a fragment at 73. But the mass spec shows 45. So that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the R' group from the ester. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', then R' could be something that upon losing RCOO would leave R' with a certain mass. So, if RCOO is 73 (like in the previous example), then R' would be, say, ethyl (C2H5), which is 43. But 45 is close, but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at 45 is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but that's 31 (CH3O+). Or maybe it's a (CH3)2O group, but as I calculated earlier, that's 46. So that's not it. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O+ fragment, which would be 44. Hmm, not matching 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. For example, if the compound is a ketone with a double bond, like cyclohexanone with a substituent. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the fragment comes from the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment. For example, if the compound is a diester or something with a larger substituent, and upon fragmentation, a smaller part breaks off, giving m/z=45.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diethyl maleate or something similar, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the degrees of unsaturation again. For option A (C6H12O2), DoU is 1. So one ring or one double bond. But we have a vinyl group (double bond), so that accounts for that. So the other DoU could be a ring, but we don't have anything indicating a ring in the data.

Option C (C6H10O2) has DoU 2. So two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But the NMR has vinyl H's, so that's a double bond. So another double bond or a ring.

Wait, the IR shows a strong peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a carbonyl, like ester or ketone. The 1650 is perhaps a conjugated carbonyl. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or one conjugated with a double bond.

If it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might have a peak around 1650. So that fits the IR data.

In that case, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that would fit C6H10O2? Let's count the carbons. CH2=CHCOO is 4 carbons (CH2-CH-C-O-O), wait, no: CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons (CH2=CH-C-O-O-). Then the ester would be O-R, where R is maybe another 3 carbons. So the total would be 6 carbons. So the formula would be C6H10O2. Because the structure would be CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, let me see. If the ester is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, then the formula would be:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: that's 3 carbons in the acid part, 3 in the alcohol part. Wait, wait: CH2=CHCOO- is three carbons (CH2=CH-C-O-O-), and the R is CH2CH2CH3, which is three carbons. So total is 3+3=6 carbons. Hydrogens: let's see:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

CH2=CHCOO-: The CH2=CHCOO group has 5 hydrogens (CH2 has 2, CH has 1, COO has 2 from the adjacent CH2). Wait, perhaps it's easier to count each part.

CH2=CHCOO-: Structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So CH2=CH- is two carbons, with 3 hydrogens (CH2 has two H, CH has one H). Then COO- is from an ester, so the ester is O connected to R.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of degrees of unsaturation. For the structure I'm thinking of (CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3), the DoU would be 2 (one from the double bond, one from the ester ring). So that's two DoU, which matches option C (C6H10O2).

But the mass spec fragment at 45. Let's think about this structure. If the ester breaks, perhaps the R group could fragment. For example, if the ester breaks into the R-O+ group, which is CH2CH2CH3O+, that would have a molecular weight of (3*12)+ (7*1) +16=36+7+16=59. Alternatively, perhaps the acylium ion is lost, giving the R group as a fragment. The acylium ion (RCO+) would have a molecular weight of (3*12) +5 +16=36+5+16=57. Hmm, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment. For example, if the ester group breaks and a part of the molecule, like the CH2=CHCOO- part, which would have a molecular weight of 72 (CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2: 3*12=36, 4 H=4, 2O=32; total 72). So that's a fragment at 72. But the mass spec shows 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragmentation leads to the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller fragment. For instance, if the compound is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (which is C6H10O2), then upon breaking, perhaps it loses the ester group (RCOO-) and leaves the R' group as a fragment. The R' group is CH2CH2CH3, which would have a molecular weight of 58 (C3H7: 3*12=36, 7*1=7 → 43?), wait no, C3H7 is 3 carbons and 7 H. 3*12=36 +7=43 → molecular weight is 43. But the fragment is at 45, so that doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of other possible structures for the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. If it's an ester with a double bond and a ring. Wait, but that would require more DoU than allowed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester (lactone) without a double bond, but then the NMR wouldn't show vinyl H's. So that can't be.

Option D is out because it has only one O.

So back to the mass spec: 45 could be a fragment from another part of the molecule. Let's think of possible fragments that sum to 45.

45 is 9*5, but that's not helpful. Let's think of the possible structures.

Wait, another approach: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHCOOH (which is 45? Wait, no, (CH3)2CHCOOH is 45? Let me compute: (CH3)2CHCOOH is C4H8O2. Its molecular weight is (4*12)+(8*1)+(2*16)=48+8+32=88. So that's not it. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. For example, if the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, then the fragment could be a smaller ketone. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, consider the possibility that the fragment is from an acyl group. For example, if the ester group is broken, the acylium ion would have a molecular weight of RCOO, which for a three-carbon group (like propenoate) would be 72 (as before), not 45.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the fragment comes from a different part of the molecule. For example, if the compound is a diol with a double bond and an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a β-keto ester. For example, something like CH3COCH2COOCH3. Let me calculate the formula: that's 6 carbons (CH3-CO-CH2-COO-CH3). Wait, no, that's more than six. Maybe a shorter chain.

Wait, perhaps the compound is methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. But then the formula would be C7H10O2, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about each option's possible structure and see which fits all clues.

Option A: C6H12O2. So formula is C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So either a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl H's, so double bond is present. So that's accounted for. So the other DoU would have to be a ring. So the structure could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. But a lactone would have a ring, and a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester without a ring but with a double bond.

The IR has a broad peak for OH, so the compound has an -OH group. So it can't be a simple lactone, which doesn't have an -OH. So perhaps it's an ester with an alcohol group elsewhere. But that would require two O's, which it has. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2OH. Wait, that's C7, but our option is C6. So maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted ester with an -OH group. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. That would be C6H10O3, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the mass spec fragment again. 45 is a common fragment in mass spectrometry, perhaps the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an isopropyl group. Wait, isopropyl is (CH3)2CH+, which is 43. Close to 45 but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2CHO+ group, which is 59.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from an acetylium ion. Acetylium is CH3CO+, which is 43. But the fragment is 45. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the fragment is from a benzene ring (m/z=91 is the tropylium ion), but then why would it be at 45? Not matching.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to make a table of each option and see which fits.

Option A: C6H12O2

IR: broad OH peak, carbonyl at 1700, 1650.

NMR: vinyl H's.

Mass spec: 45.

Structure: possible ester with a double bond. But where is the OH group?

Option C: C6H10O2

IR: same.

Structure: could be an ester with a double bond and a ring (two DoU). Or a di-ester.

But where does the 45 come from?

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the options.

Option C: C6H10O2. Let's calculate the possible structure.

If it's an ester, then the formula would be RCOOR', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. The sum of carbons in R and R' should be 6.

Wait, RCOOR' would have (n + m +2) carbons? No, wait: R is (n carbons), R' is (m carbons). Then RCOOR' is n + m +2? Wait, no. Let me think: R is (n carbons), RCOO is (n+1 carbons), RCOOR' is (n+1 + m) carbons. So for n+1 +m=6 → n +m=5.

So possible combinations: n=3, m=2; n=4, m=1; etc.

So for example, R= propyl (3 carbons), R'= methyl (1 carbon). Then RCOOR' would be propanoate methyl ester, which is CH2CH2COOCH3. But that's C4H8O2, which is not C6.

Wait, that's getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group attached. So something like cyclohexene ester. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. So for example, a five-membered ring with a double bond. Wait, but that might not fit the molecular formula.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an orthoester, but that's probably not relevant here.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the structure. Let me think about the mass spec fragment again.

If the fragment is at m/z=45, it's likely a small group. What if it's the loss of a ketone group? Like, the molecule loses a CO group, leaving a fragment of (M - CO) = M -28. But if M is 116 (option A), then 116-28=88. But the fragment is at 45, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if the molecule breaks into a CH3COO group (43) and the rest. But 43 is close to 45.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure might be something like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is another group.

So for option C (C6H10O2), the structure could be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let me check the formula: CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2. Yes, because CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. Wait, no: CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7. So the total is C6H10O2. Yes.

Now, what would the mass spec look like for this compound? The molecular ion would be at 114 (since 6*12=72, 10 H=10, 2*16=32 → 72+10+32=114). The fragment at 45 could come from the CH2=CHCOO group losing the rest. Wait, the CH2=CHCOO group is 72 (3*12=36, 4 H=4, 2 O=32 → 72). So that's not 45.

Wait, maybe upon fragmentation, the molecule breaks into smaller parts. Suppose the ester group breaks, and the R group is CH2CH2CH3 (which is 58 g/mol) and the acylium ion is CH2=CHCOO+ (72 g/mol). But neither are 45.

Hmm, perhaps the fragment at 45 is from a different part. Maybe the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment that includes a methyl group or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of a larger group, leaving a smaller one. For example, losing the ester group (72) would leave the R group (CH2CH2CH3), which is 58. Not matching 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is from the allylic position. For example, the molecule has a double bond, and upon fragmentation, the allylic group breaks off.

Alternatively, maybe it's a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in mass spectrometry for esters or ketones, producing a fragment at m/z=45. Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at 45 is a (CH3)2CHO+ ion. (CH3)2CHO is 59. No, that's not 45.

Wait, let me think of the possible structure again. Let's say the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond. The structure is CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is a three-carbon group.

If R is CH2CH2CH3, then the formula is C6H10O2 (3 from CH2=CHCOO and 3 from R). The molecular weight is 114.

Upon fragmentation, maybe the molecule breaks at the ester oxygen, leading to two fragments: R-O- and the acylium ion. But R is CH2CH2CH3, which is 58. So that's not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond breaks, leading to a smaller fragment. For example, the molecule could break into CH2=CHCOO and CH2CH2CH3. But those are 72 and 58, not 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm not getting anywhere with this. Let me think about the options again.

The correct answer must have both a carbonyl group (from the IR) and an -OH group (from the broad peak). So the formula must have at least two O's. So options A, C, and D have two O's, but D's formula is C6H12O, which only has one O. Wait, no, option D is C6H12O. So only one O. So that can't have both a carbonyl and an OH. So option D is out.

That leaves options A, B, and C.

Option B: C6H10O. Only one O. So it can't have both a carbonyl and an OH group. So option B is out.

So now, we're left with options A and C.

So the correct answer is either A (C6H12O2) or C (C6H10O2).

Which of these has a structure that would explain the mass spec fragment at 45?

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation is 1. So one double bond or one ring.

Given the NMR shows vinyl H's, that's the double bond. So the structure must have a double bond and an ester group.

The IR shows a broad peak for OH, so the structure must have an -OH group.

So perhaps the structure is an ester with an -OH group and a double bond.

But the formula for that would require two O's, which it has.

So maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Let me check the formula: CH2=CHCOO has 3 carbons, and CH2CH2OH has 4? No, wait: CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and CH2CH2OH is C2H5OH (which is C2H6O). So combining them would be C5H10O3, which isn't matching any option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with an -OH group, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, maybe the structure is a diol ester. For example, a molecule with two -OH groups and an ester. But that would require more O's, which would make the formula C6H12O3, which isn't an option.

So perhaps option A isn't the right structure, and option C is.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Structure: perhaps a di-ester, but that would require more O's. Alternatively, an ester and a ketone. No, that would require more O's.

Wait, maybe the structure is a β-keto ester. For example, CH3COCH2COOCH2CH3. Let me calculate the formula: that's 6 carbons.

Structure: CH3-CO-CH2-COO-CH2CH3.

Wait, the formula would be C6H10O3, which isn't one of the options. So that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the mass spec fragment again.

If the fragment is 45, which is a relatively small mass, perhaps it's a fragment from the loss of a larger part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule loses a group with a molecular weight of (M -45), where M is the molecular weight.

For option C: M is 114. So 114 -45=69. So if the molecule loses a group of 69, the remaining fragment would be 45. What's a group with 69? Maybe a propyl group attached to something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at 45 is a result of the ester group breaking. For example, if the ester breaks into RCOO+ and R', and R' is 45, then R' would be a group with molecular weight 45. So R' would have to be something like CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's 43). Alternatively, maybe it's a group with a functional group, like CH3CO (43), but that's not 45.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a result of the cleavage of the ester group, producing an acylium ion. For example, if the ester is RCOOR', then cleavage could produce RCOO+ (m/z= RCOO) and R'. So if RCOO is 45, then R would be small.

RCOO=45 → RCOO=45 → R has a molecular weight of 45 - 32 (COO is 32) → R is 13. But 13 isn't possible for an alkyl group. So that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the loss of an acyl group, leaving a fragment of 45. For example, if the acyl group is 69 (since 114-45=69), but that's a large acyl group.

Hmm, I'm really not making progress here. Let me think about the possible structures again.

Given that the IR shows a broad peak for OH and a strong peak for a carbonyl, and the NMR shows vinyl H's, the structure must have both an -OH group, a carbonyl, and a double bond.

So, perhaps the compound is a β-keto alcohol, but that would require three O's, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cinnamic acid derivative. Cinnamic acid is CH2=CHCOOH (C9H8O2), but again, that's more than six carbons.

Wait, but option C is C6H10O2. So maybe it's a smaller structure, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2. Wait, that's five carbons. Hmm, not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond and an -OH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: looking for a compound that fits all the criteria.

- FTIR: OH (broad, 3000), carbonyl (1700) and possibly conjugated (1650).

- 1H NMR: vinyl H's → double bond.

- Mass spec: fragment at 45.

- Formula: must have two O's (since it has both OH and carbonyl).

So the structure must have both a carbonyl (like ester, ketone, etc.), an -OH group, and a double bond.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Wait, but that would have three O's (the ester has two, and the OH adds another), making the formula C6H10O3, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, so maybe it's a different structure. Maybe the compound is a diester with an -OH group, but that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic hemiacetal ester, but that's probably not relevant.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is an allyl ester with a hydroxyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2OH. But that's C6H10O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the clues.

The fragment at 45 suggests a small group. If the compound is an ester, perhaps the R' group is CH2CH2CH3 (which is 58), but that's not 45. Alternatively, perhaps the R group is CH3CH2 (45 is not matching). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a cleavage involving the ester oxygen. For example, the ester could cleave into two parts: one being the acylium ion and the other being the alcohol fragment. If the acylium ion is 45, then RCOO would be 45. So RCOO is 45 → R is 13, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the ester's R' group. For example, if R' is CH2CH2CH3, which is 58, that's too high. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is due to the loss of the entire ester group, leaving a smaller fragment. For example, if the ester group is lost, the remaining fragment would be an alkyl group. But that doesn't fit 45.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an -OH group and a double bond. Then, upon fragmentation, perhaps a smaller fragment breaks off, giving m/z=45.

But I'm not sure, and I'm running out of time to think through this.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is C) C6H10O2.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options provided are C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O. Each clue from the characterization techniques is analyzed to determine the correct formula.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an -OH group.
   - Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (likely an ester or ketone) and possibly a conjugated system (e.g., an alkene).

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is observed. This suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - For C₆H₁₂O₂:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 1
     \]
     This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which could correspond to a double bond or a ring.
   - For C₆H₁₀O:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2
     \]
     This indicates two degrees of unsaturation, which could correspond to a combination of a double bond and a ring.
   - For C₆H₁₀O₂:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2
     \]
     This also indicates two degrees of unsaturation.
   - For C₆H₁₂O:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 1
     \]
     This indicates one degree of unsaturation.

5. **Elimination of Options**:
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: This formula contains only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to account for both the -OH group (broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹) and the carbonyl group (strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹). Thus, this option is eliminated.
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: Similar to Option B, this formula has only one oxygen atom, making it unable to accommodate both the -OH group and the carbonyl group. This option is also eliminated.
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula has two oxygen atoms, which could accommodate both the -OH group and the carbonyl group. However, the degrees of unsaturation (1) suggest only one double bond or ring, which conflicts with the presence of vinyl hydrogens (indicating a double bond) and the need for a conjugated system (suggested by the IR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹). This makes Option A less likely.
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: This formula has two oxygen atoms, which can accommodate both the -OH group and the carbonyl group. The degrees of unsaturation (2) align with the presence of a double bond (from vinyl hydrogens) and a conjugated system (from the IR peak at 1650 cm⁻¹). Additionally, the molecular weight of 114 (C₆H₁₀O₂) is consistent with the mass spectrometry data, as the fragment at m/z = 45 could arise from a smaller fragment of the molecule.

### Conclusion:
Based on the FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, the compound is most consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.
