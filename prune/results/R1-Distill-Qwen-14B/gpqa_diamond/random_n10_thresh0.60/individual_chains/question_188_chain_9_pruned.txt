Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm supposed to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula for calculating this probably involves some sort of reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices of the plane.

Wait, right! The general formula for the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by d = (a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α) - (2kl cos β) - (2hl cos γ) )) ), assuming it's a triclinic system. But wait, rhombohedral is a special case where all the lattice parameters are equal and all angles are equal too. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. So that might simplify things.

So for a rhombohedral crystal, the formula should be a bit simpler. Let me recall. The interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral system can be calculated using a modified version of the general formula. Since all the a's are the same and all the angles are the same, the formula can be simplified.

The general expression for the interplanar distance for a crystal system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²
