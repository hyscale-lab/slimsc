Okay, so I have this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stellar astrophysics, the ionization states of elements like iron can tell us about the temperature of a star. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. So if star_1 has twice the excitation, maybe the ratio of excited to unexcited atoms is 2:1, whereas for star_2 it's 1:1 or something else?

Wait, the problem states that the energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. That's the delta E, I think. Since the photospheres are in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann equation. Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - delta_E / (k*T) ), where delta_E is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that for star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is 2. For star_2, I'm not exactly sure, but wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So maybe in star_2, the ratio is 1, and for star_1 it's 2? Or maybe star_2 is 1, star_1 is 2. Hmm, actually, I think the way the question is phrased is that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So probably, for star_1, (n_upper1/n_lower1) = 2*(n_upper2/n_lower2). Or does it mean that the excitation in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2, so the ratio is 2 times that of star_2?

Wait, the actual wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation (like the population) is
