Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. 

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III reactions stop, the change in neutrino production would take that much time to become noticeable on Earth. But since the question is about the flux ratio right now, after the pp-III stopped, I guess the neutrinos we're detecting now are from before the stoppage for the lower energy bands, but maybe not for all. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The main source of the Sun's energy. The pp-III reactions produce high-energy neutrinos, I think. Specifically, the Beryllium-7 (Be7) neutrinos. Those are the ones that are higher energy. Oh wait, no, the pp-I and pp-II produce lower energy neutrinos, and pp-III produces higher. Or maybe I have that backwards. Let me think. The dominant neutrino production in the Sun is from the proton-proton chain, which has two main branches: pp-I and pp-III. The pp-III branch involves the production of boron-8 (B8), which decays into Be7 and emits a positron and a neutrino. These Be7 neutrinos are the high-energy ones, right
