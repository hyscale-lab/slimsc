Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which of the given statements is correct.

First, I think I should write down the matrix Ay. Since Ay is c times S, let me compute that. c is h/(4π), so each element of S will be multiplied by that.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then Ay = c * S:
Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ 0    -i ]
                [ i     0 ]

Wait, but actually, wait a second. Oh, no, wait: c is h/(4π), so when I multiply S by c, each entry becomes (h/(4π)) * the corresponding entry in S.

So, the matrix Ay is:
[ 0*(h/4π) , (-i)*(h/4π) ]
[ i*(h/4π) , 0*(h/4π) ]

So that's:
[ 0 , (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π) , 0 ]

I think that's correct. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues a satisfy the equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix Ay - a I. The identity matrix I is 2x2 with 1s on the diagonal.

So Ay - a I is:
[ -a    (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (i*(-i) h² )/( (4π)^2 ) ]

Wait, because the product is (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) = i*(-i) * h²/(4π)^2. Let me compute that.

i multiplied by (-i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the product is (1) * h²/(16 π²) = h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant equation becomes:

a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me check that again. Wait, sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π), because sqrt( (h/(4π))² )= h/(4π). No, because 16 is 4 squared, so sqrt(16) is 4. So h²/(16 π²) is (h/(4π))². So the square root is h/(4π). So a
