Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think. So, the question is about finding the maximum speed v_max of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is found using energy conservation. But since this is relativistic, I guess some modifications are needed.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx². In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic, right? The total energy E is (1/2)kA², so setting E = (1/2)mv² gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the non-relativistic case. The options include C which is that, but I think since the question is relativistic, option C might be ruled out.

In relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The correct relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E in this case would include the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. 

Wait, but wait. In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and the oscillatory potential energy? Or is the potential energy treated differently? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The oscillator is governed by F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)kx². The system's total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all energy is potential, and at equilibrium position (x=0), all is kinetic. So, the maximum kinetic energy is E - mc², where E is the total energy.

Wait, no. Wait, in the relativistic context, the total energy is gamma mc². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, and the total energy is just the potential energy plus the rest energy. Or is the potential energy part of the total energy? Hmm, perhaps I should model this with energy conservation.

So, when the mass is at x=A, it's at rest, so its energy is purely the potential energy plus the rest mass energy. When it's at x=0, it's moving at maximum speed, so all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy (plus rest energy). So the total energy at x=A is E = (1/2)kA² + mc². At x=0, E is (gamma) mc², where gamma is due to the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because at x=0, the potential energy is zero (assuming V(0)=0), so the energy is just kinetic plus rest energy. So E = K + mc², where K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should set E as the sum of rest energy and the potential energy. Because the total mechanical energy in the oscillator is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA² + mc². When the mass is at x=0, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, E = K + mc². Wait, but K is (gamma - 1) mc². So E = (gamma -1 ) mc² + mc² = gamma mc².

So E must be equal to (1/2)kA² + mc². Therefore,

gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + mc²

Subtract mc² from both sides:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2)kA²

Factor out mc² on the left:

mc² (gamma - 1) = (1/2) k A²

But (gamma - 1) mc² is the relativistic kinetic energy K. So this makes sense, as the potential energy (1/2 k A²) is equal to K.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, K = (1/2)mv², and when set equal to (1/2)kA², we get v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). So in the relativistic case, the maximum speed is where the kinetic energy equals (1/2)kA². So going back, the equation is:

(gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A²

Let me write gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

( (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) * mc² = (1/2)k A²

Divide both sides by mc²:

( (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ) = (k A²)/(2 mc²)

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 mc²) as a parameter for simplicity. Let’s call this parameter alpha.

So,

(1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 = alpha

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha

Take reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Which simplifies to:

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha²

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 mc²). Let me plug that back in.

alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c²)

So,

v²/c² = [ 2*(k A^2)/(2 m c²) + (k A^2/(2 m c²))² ] / [1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))]^2

Simplify numerator:

2 * (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A²)/(m c²)

So numerator is (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2.

Wait, maybe simplifying this expression step by step would help.

Let me denote beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so alpha = beta. Then,

v²/c² = [ 2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta)^2

Which can be written as [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2

But let me see:

Numerator: beta (2 + beta)
Denominator: (1 + beta)^2

Hmm, perhaps there's a way to simplify this. Let me factor:

Numerator: beta (beta + 2)
Denominator: (beta + 1)^2

I don't see an immediate simplification, so perhaps I'll rewrite the expression as:

v²/c² = [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta + 1)^2

= [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta^2 + 2 beta + 1 )

Wait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator differently.

Alternatively, maybe factor beta + 2 as (beta + 1) + 1.

Not sure. Let's proceed.

So, v = c * sqrt( [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta + 1)^2 )

Take the square root:

v = c * sqrt( beta (beta + 2) ) / (beta + 1)

But sqrt(beta (beta + 2)) can be written as sqrt( beta^2 + 2 beta )

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can manipulate the expression:

v_max^2 = c^2 [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta + 1)^2

Where beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me substitute beta back into this expression.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) * ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + 2 ) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2

Let me factor c^2 in the denominator terms to make it clearer.

Wait, let me rewrite each term.

Let me write beta = (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ beta (beta + 2) ] / (beta + 1)^2

Expanding beta +2 = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + 2.

Wait, I think I'm stuck here. Perhaps I should look at the given options and see which form matches.

The options are:

A) v_max= c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2/(2m))^2 ) )

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me compute the denominator in our expression:

beta +1 = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) +1 = [k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )

And beta +2 would be [k A^2 +4 m c^2 ]/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, but perhaps I should factor the expression further.

Let me go back to the equation:

gamma = (1 + alpha), where alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, no, earlier we had gamma = 1 + alpha, where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, no, let me recheck:

We had:

gamma mc^2 = (1/2) k A^2 + mc^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Ah, wait that's not correct. Let me retrace:

Wait, earlier, we had:

gamma mc^2 = (1/2) k A^2 + mc².

Subtract mc² from both sides,

gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = (1/2) k A².

Factor mc²,

mc² (gamma -1 ) = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma -1 = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is,

gamma = 1 + beta, where beta is k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

But wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + beta.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + beta.

Which is,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + beta )

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + beta )^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2

= [ (1 + beta )^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta )^2

Expanding numerator,

(1 + 2 beta + beta² -1 ) = 2 beta + beta².

So,

v²/c² = (2 beta + beta²)/(1 + beta )^2

Factor numerator as beta (2 + beta ), denominator as (1 + beta )^2.

So,

v^2 = c² [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )^2

Looking at the options, I need to see which one matches this.

Looking at option B:

v_max= c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²/(2 m c² )) )

Wait, that doesn't seem to fit, because in our expression, it's [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2 under the sqrt.

Looking at option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Hmm, let's compute 1 - [1/(1 + beta )^2 ]

Wait, 1 - [1/(1 + beta )^2 ] = [ (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta )^2 = [ 2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta )^2.

Which is exactly what v^2 / c^2 is. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( (beta (2 + beta )) ) / (1 + beta )

Wait, but option D is written as sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 ), which is the same as sqrt( [ (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is sqrt( [2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as our expression. So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

Which is same as option D?

Wait, looking at option D:

D) v_max= c√(1−1/(1+kA²/(2 mc² ))^2 )

Yes, because 1/(1 + beta )^2 is [1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c² )) )^2 ]

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, beta = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

1/(1 + beta )^2 = 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 = [ (1 + beta )^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta )^2 = [ 2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta )^2

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2 beta + beta^2 ]/(1 + beta )^2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 ) times c.

So, option D is:

sqrt(1−1/(1+ (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ) * c.

Which matches our expression.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B is:

v_max = c√(1 + 1/(1−kA²/(2mc^2} )

Hmm, that doesn't match. So option D seems correct.

Wait, but let me reevaluate. Because the denominator in option D is (1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2 )) )^2.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we use relativistic energy conservation principles. The total energy \( E \) of the system is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the potential energy at maximum displacement, \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is given by the relativistic expression \( E = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).

Equating the total energy at maximum displacement and equilibrium:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Factoring out \( mc^2 \) on the left:

\[
mc^2 (\gamma - 1) = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Let \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:

\[
\gamma - 1 = \beta
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \beta
\]

Since \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \beta
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \beta}
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}
\]

Substituting \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

Comparing this result with the options, it matches **Option D**:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
