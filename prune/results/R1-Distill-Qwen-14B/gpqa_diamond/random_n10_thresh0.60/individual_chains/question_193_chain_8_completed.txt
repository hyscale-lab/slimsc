Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again to make sure I get what's being asked.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are different powers of r: r^3, r^5, r^4, r^2.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, actually, more accurately, plx in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

So if plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. Therefore, plx is inversely proportional to distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The problem states that the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So substituting plx with d, since plx is 1/d, then 1/(plx) is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because plx is 1/d, so 1/(plx) is d. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So when distance d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. Oh, wait, I think I need to find the number of stars per unit distance. Like, how does the number of stars increase as you move a small distance dr.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the differential: how does N change when you go from distance r to r + dr, so dN/dr is the derivative of N with respect to r.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5r^4. But wait, let's think again.

Wait, wait, no. Because the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is N ∝ (d)^5. Because plx = 1/d, so 1/(plx) is d, so 1/(plx)^5 is d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is a constant.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So, per unit range of r, like how many stars are added when you increase the distance by a small amount.

So, if you consider dN/dr, that would be the derivative of N with respect to r. Since N = k r^5, then dN/dr = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (the rate of change) is proportional to r^4.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is r^4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not getting confused. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit distance, that is, dN/dr is proportional to r^4.

So the correct answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, \( N \propto r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, we calculate the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Since \( N \propto r^5 \), the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \) is proportional to \( r^4 \). This means the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Among the given options, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
