Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Let me see what I remember. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to move the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

So, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a combination of both rotational and vibrational energy states. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, maybe it's just the rotation part? Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering both vibrations and rotations, but I'll have to think about how they contribute to the energy levels.

The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest energy state. We're looking for the photon momentum that allows it to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state would probably be the first excited state.

I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized. The rotational and vibrational energies are quantized separately, so the total energy is the sum of both. The fundamental state would have the lowest vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps it's considering the next state as the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Which one requires less energy? I think the vibrational energy levels are spaced more closely than rotational ones. No, wait, the spacing for rotation is actually closer because rotational energy depends on the square of the quantum number, so each step increases by more. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the angular frequency for vibration is given, so maybe the transition is mainly about the vibrational state. Let me think. The energy levels for a harmonic oscillator (vibrational) are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h w, where v is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (J (J+1) ) h c / (8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule could either increase its vibrational quantum number by one (v → v+1) or increase its rotational quantum number (J → J+1). The transition that requires the least energy would be the one with the lowest photon energy. So I need to compare the energy differences for these transitions.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0 and J=0, I think. So to find the next state, the next lowest would be the next possible state. Let
