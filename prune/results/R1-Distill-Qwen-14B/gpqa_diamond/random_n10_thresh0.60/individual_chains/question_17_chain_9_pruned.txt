Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's take a deep breath and tackle it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my classes.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They gave me the formation constant, KCa-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. I need to choose the correct concentration from the options A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this has to do with complex ions and their dissociation. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formula of the complex would be Ca-EDTA^2- because calcium is a divalent cation and EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. So the complex is Ca(EDTA)²⁻.

The problem mentions the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. But I'm being asked about the concentration of free calcium ions. So, the complex dissociates a bit, releasing some Ca²+ ions into the solution.

What's the formula for the formation constant (Kf)? I remember that Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−
Wait, I might have the charges a bit wrong. Let me think. EDTA is usually in the form H4Y, but in solution, it's often deprotonated. At pH where it's ideal, I think EDTA is in its Y^4- form. So the reaction should be:
Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²−

Yes, that's right. The formation constant Kf is given by [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But wait, the problem gives me KCa-EDTA, which I think is the same as Kf. So KCa-EDTA = Kf = 5x10^10.

The solution has 0.02 M of CaY²−. Assuming that the solution is such that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, I need to find [Ca²+].

But wait, what about the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDT
