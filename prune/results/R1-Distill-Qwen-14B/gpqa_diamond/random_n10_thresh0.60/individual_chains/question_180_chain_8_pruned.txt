Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Out of these, 12 are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals, in Joules. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So I remember that the potential energy in an electrostatic system comes from the interactions between charges. Since the system is isolated, I think the energy is just the electric potential energy between all the charges.

Wait, but since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P, the setup is kind of symmetric. So the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is fixed there.

Wait, but each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the 13th is 2e as well. So each of the 12 is 2e, and the one at P is 2e. So the interaction between the 13th and each of the 12 would be between two 2e charges.

Wait, but also, the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P. So maybe I can model this as the potential energy between the central charge and each of the others, plus the potential energy between the 12 charges
