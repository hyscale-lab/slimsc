Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a 2-dimensional metric because there are only dx² and dy² terms. But wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? So I'm probably dealing with a 2D space here, maybe something like hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, so maybe it's a coordinate system on a 2D surface. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). That reminds me of the metric for the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. Let me recall: the Poincaré disk model has a metric like (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²), where the radius is related to the curvature. Oh, wait, but in this problem, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²), not (1 - x² - y²). Hmm, that's a bit different.

Wait, maybe the 4 is related to the radius. So if the radius is r=2, perhaps the curvature is involved. The curvature K is related to the radius by K = -1/r². So for r=2
