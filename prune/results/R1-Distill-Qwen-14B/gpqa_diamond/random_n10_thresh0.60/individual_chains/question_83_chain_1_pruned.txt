Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on titration calculations, but let's see. The question involves diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The problem gives me the initial volumes and concentrations, and I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula.

The initial step is diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2, I can find the new concentration.

Wait, C1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So C2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1)/40 = 0.025 M. Oh, right, so the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid after dilution. The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So, since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed at equivalence point would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, equivalence is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration. So that's 25% of the equivalence point volume. 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of moles. 25% of the equivalence point means 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of NaOH added. But wait, each mole
