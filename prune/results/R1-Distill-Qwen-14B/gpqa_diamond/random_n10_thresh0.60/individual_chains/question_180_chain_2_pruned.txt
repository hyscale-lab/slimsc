Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. So that's 3.2e-19 C each.

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so the 13th is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. Wait, but each of those 12 is 2m from P, or are they all at a distance of 2m from P? I think the question says each is 2m from P. So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others arranged around it at 2 meters.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no. The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the system consists of 13 charges: 1 at P, and 12 each at 2m from P. So the total number of charges is 13, each 2e.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. Minimum energy, so I think that refers to the electric potential energy, which would be the potential energy due to all the charges being in that configuration.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is
