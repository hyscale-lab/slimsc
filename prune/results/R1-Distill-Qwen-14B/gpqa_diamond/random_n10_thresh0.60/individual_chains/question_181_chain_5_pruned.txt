Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces a lot of neutrinos through various nuclear reactions, and different reactions produce neutrinos of different energies. The question is about the flux ratio of two specific energy bands after the pp-III branch suddenly stops.

Wait, the pp-III branch... I think the pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There are different branches in the pp chain. The pp-I and pp-II are maybe lower branches, and pp-III is a higher one? Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Oh right, I think the pp chain has different steps, and one of them is the pp-III branch. The main one is the proton-proton chain where two protons fuse into deuterium, then another proton fuses, and then the Beryllium-8 captures two protons. But the pp-III branch is a specific part of it.

So the question says that pp-III stops, but other reactions continue. How does this affect neutrino production? Well, neutrinos are produced in different processes. The main ones are the pp chain, the CNO cycle (which is another fusion process in the Sun), and maybe other minor processes.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos, but so do other parts of the pp chain. So if the pp-III stops, that part of the neutrino production would stop. But the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands.

I remember that the pp-III branch is responsible for producing higher energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. So if the pp-III stops, the flux of higher energy neutrinos would decrease, but the others would remain.

The bands given are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So band 1 is lower energy, band 2 higher. If pp-III is a source of higher energy neutrinos, then stopping it would mean that the flux in higher bands (like band 2) would drop more than the lower ones.

Wait, but what's the typical energy distribution of neutrinos from different processes? I think the standard pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, and the pp-III branch produces higher-energy ones. Or was it the other way around? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with the CNO cycle.

Wait, the CNO cycle is in the core as well and contributes a significant part of the Sun's fusion. The CNO neutrinos, I think, have higher energies on average than
