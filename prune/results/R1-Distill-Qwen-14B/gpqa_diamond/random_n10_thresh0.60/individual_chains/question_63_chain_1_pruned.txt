Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They give me the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration Ï‰ is 4e14 rad/s. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch it to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, I remember that the quantum rotation-vibration model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. The molecule's energy levels are a combination of these two. In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, and for the vibration, it's like a quantum harmonic oscillator.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy... Hmm, that probably means either increasing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational one. But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy". I think that implies the smallest possible increase in energy, which would be the next vibrational state. Or wait, could it be the next rotational state? Or maybe it's a transition to a state where either vibrational or rotational is incremented.

Wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, which is probably what they're referring to, the molecule is allowed to have some vibration as it rotates. But the energy levels would still involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

So, the molecule is in its ground
