Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. The energy-time uncertainty principle, right? It states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's approximated as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the states might not be distinguishable because the uncertainty in energy would be too large. The longer the lifetime (Δt), the smaller the uncertainty in energy (ΔE), because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt.

Wait, but in this question, the lifetimes are given. I think the uncertainty in time Δt here refers to the lifetime of the state. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to its lifetime.

So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE_i is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime τ_i. Because Δt is the lifetime τ.

So, let's compute the uncertainties for each state.

The first state has τ1 = 1e-9 seconds. So, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1.
Similarly, the second state has τ2 = 1e-8 seconds. So, Δ
