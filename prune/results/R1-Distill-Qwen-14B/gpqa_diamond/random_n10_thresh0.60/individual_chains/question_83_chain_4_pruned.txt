Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration problems can get tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we're titrating that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka for acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down. First, I should probably figure out what's happening at each stage: the initial dilution, then during titration, and specifically at 25% and equivalence points.

Wait, so when you dilute acetic acid with water, the concentration decreases. Then when you titrate with NaOH, you're adding a strong base to a weak acid. The reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, forming acetate ions.

First, let me compute the initial concentrations after dilution.

The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, 0.05 M. So the moles of acetic acid are 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol.

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration before titration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid solution is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the equivalence point?

Molarity times volume for each reactant must be equal. The moles of CH3COOH are 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 mol.

The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point. So that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but wait a second. The 25% titration usually refers to the fraction of the acid neutralized. So 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized by NaOH.

Alternatively, maybe 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence is added. Hmm, depends on how it's phrased. The question states "25% titration" which I think refers to 25% of the acid has reacted. So, that would be 0.25 * 0.001 mol =
