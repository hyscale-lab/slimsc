Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars meet the brightness requirements for both instruments.

Let me read the question again. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning V <= 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <=16. So a star needs to have V mag <=16 for HIRES and <=17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17, which means apparent V <=17. Because brighter means lower magnitude. So for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V mag <=16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16). Because if a star is dimmer than 16 mag, say 17, then HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO could. So both must be able to observe the star, so the apparent V must be <=16.

Alternatively, wait, let's think again. The question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Brighter is lower magnitude, so that's V <=17. For HIRES, brighter than 16 mag, so V <=16.

So any star that has apparent V mag <=16 can be seen by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, so no star can have V>16 and be detected by both. So the star's apparent V has to be <=16.

Now, looking at each star:

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, located at 10 pc. Wait, but apparent magnitude depends on distance. The formula is m = M +5 +5 log10(d) - 5, because M is absolute magnitude, and m is apparent. Oh wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d / 10 pc). So for Star1, d=10 pc. So log(10/10) is 0, so m = M +5*(0) = M. So m=15.5.

But wait, Star1's V mag is absolute magnitude? Or is it apparent? Let me check. The question says: "absolute V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 10 pc distance
