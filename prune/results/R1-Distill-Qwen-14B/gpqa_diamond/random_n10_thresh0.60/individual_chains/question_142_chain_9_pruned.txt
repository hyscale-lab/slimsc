Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the density matrix. Hmm, the question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The options are vectors in three dimensions, which is a bit confusing because I thought qubit space is two-dimensional. Oh wait, maybe it's referring to the Bloch sphere representation.

The density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But this one has two projectors added together, each multiplied by 1/2. That makes me think it's a mixed state with equal probability between |0> and |1>.

Now, how do I represent this on the Bloch sphere? The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. For a mixed state that's equally likely to be |0> or |1>, where would that point be?

The general form of a density matrix for a mixed state of two qubits is ρ = p|0><0| + (1-p)|1><1|, but here p is 1/2. So in terms of the Bloch vector, which is represented as (x, y, z), the pure states |0> and |1> are at (0,0,1) and (0,0,-1) respectively. Wait, no, |0> is at (0,0,1) and |1> is at (0,0,-1) on the Bloch sphere. But when you have a mixture of the two, the Bloch vector would be a weighted average of their positions.

So if it's a 50-50 mixture, the average position would be the midpoint between (0,0,1) and (0,0,-1). The midpoint is (0,0,0). So the Bloch vector would be (0,0,0), which is the origin. That makes sense because the state doesn't have any preference in any direction; it's completely mixed.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which matches. The other options don't fit. Option B is (0,0,1), which would be |0>, and option A is (1,1,0), which doesn't correspond to any standard state. Option
