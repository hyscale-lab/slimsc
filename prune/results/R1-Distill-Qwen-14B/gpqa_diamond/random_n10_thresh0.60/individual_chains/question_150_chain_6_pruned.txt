Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and it's reacted through a series of reagents. The options are four different products, so I need to figure out what the starting material is, what the reactions do, and then identify the product.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Hmm, integrating for 1H, 2H, etc.

So, the 9.72 ppm is a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehyde protons usually show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually singlets unless there's some coupling, but perhaps in some cases, like if it's conjugated or part of a di-substituted system.

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted phenyl groups. Because a para-substituted benzene would have two doublets each integrating to 2H. For example, if you have two phenyl groups attached to something else, each with substituents in the para position.

Then there's a 6.27 doublet of doublets or a broad singlet? No, the question says 'bs', which I think is broad singlet. Integrating to 2H. That might be an ethylene group (CH2) that's part of an enal or something. Or maybe it's a diene system.

The 3.66 ppm as a doublet for 2H. That looks like a CH2 group attached to something electronegative, maybe oxygen. Like an ether or an ester. Or perhaps an OCH2 group. Because the shift is around 3.66, which is typical for CH2O.

Putting this together: the molecule probably has a structure where there's an aromatic ring (maybe two of them), a conjugated system with an aldehyde or ketone group, and some oxygen-containing functional groups.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Formula is C8H9NO. Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or a double bond. Formula is CnHmOxNy. For each molecule, degrees of unsaturation = (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), y=1 (N).

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18-11)/2 = 7/2=3.5? Wait, that can't be right because
