Okay, so I have this physics problem about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I guess I need to calculate the mean decay length of this meson.

Wait, what do I remember about meson decay? Oh right, the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. The formula I think is τ = ħ / Γ, where Γ is the decay width. But wait, is that right? Or is it Γ that's the total decay rate, and the mean lifetime is the inverse of the decay rate? Yeah, I think so. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying by the velocity of the meson and its lifetime. So distance L = v * τ. But wait, what's the velocity here? The meson is moving with some energy, so I can use relativistic mechanics to find its velocity.

The meson's total energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much larger than the mass, meaning it's moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. To find the velocity, I can use the relativistic energy formula: E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But wait, since E and m are given in GeV, I have to
