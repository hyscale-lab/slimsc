Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star has an effective temperature of 6000 K. The spots are covering 20% of the hemisphere, and they're cooler by 1000 K. The situation is causing brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transit when only one hemisphere is spotted. The task is to find what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would have to be to produce the same brightness variation.

Hmm. So I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area is proportional to the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the star isn't being blocked by a planet, but rather dark spots are causing the variation. So the brightness change is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer.

Let me think about how this works. The star's total brightness is the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas. The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, actually, since it's one hemisphere, the total area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere's surface. Let me clarify: the star's surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere would be 2πR². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the spots cover 0.4πR² area. But wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total surface area the spots cover on the star. Alternatively, maybe the question is saying that one hemisphere (so half the star) is covered, but with a filling factor of 20%, which is the fraction of the hemisphere that's spotted. So the total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 of the entire star's surface
