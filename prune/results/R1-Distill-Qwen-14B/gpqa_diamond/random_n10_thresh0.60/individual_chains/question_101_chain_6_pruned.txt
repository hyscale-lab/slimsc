Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic secondary amine. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine ring. So, the reaction must be forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond, perhaps via some kind of alkylation or addition.

Wait, the reaction is acid-catalyzed. Acid catalysis in such reactions often involves protonation of amines to form carbocations or facilitate some kind of electrophilic substitution. But wait, pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four CH2 groups and one NH. Oh wait, no: pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring with four CH2 groups and one N. So the structure is like a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. So 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the structure would be the pyrrolidine ring with a substituent on the 1-position, which is the nitrogen? Wait, wait. Wait, pyrrolidine has five members, so the positions are numbered such that the nitrogen is at position 1. So the substituent is on the nitrogen. So the product is a quaternary ammonium compound where the nitrogen is attached to a cyclohexylidenemethyl group.

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl is the same as cyclohexylidene (which is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond substituent) attached to a methyl group? Or is cyclohexylidenemethyl a cyclohexane ring connected via a double bond to a methyl group? Hmm, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached via a CH2 group. No, wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond to a methyl group. Oh wait, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring where the double bond is between the cyclohexane ring and a methyl group. So, like a cyc
