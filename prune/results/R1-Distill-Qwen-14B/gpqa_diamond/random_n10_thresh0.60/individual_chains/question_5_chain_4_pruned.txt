Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh right, I remember operators and eigenvectors from my studies, but I need to think carefully here.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of matrices. So, P is a vector operator, and I'm looking for its eigenvector along a direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so n is (nx, 0, nz), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given as ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. Let me write them down:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator I'm interested in is the projection of P along the direction n. The projection of a vector operator is given by the dot product of the operator with the direction vector. So, the operator P·n would be nx P_x + nz P_z, since the y-component of n is zero.

So, P·n = nx * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let me factor out (ħ/2):

P·n = (ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So the matrix inside becomes:

Row 1: [nz * 1, nx * 1]
Row 2: [nx * 1, -nz * 1]

So the matrix is [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] multiplied by ħ/2.

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

But since (P·n) is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix I mentioned, the equation becomes:

(ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] * |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the matrix equation is:

[nz a + nx b, nx a - nz b] = [a, b]

Which gives a system of equations:

nz a + nx b = a → (nz -1) a + nx b =0

nx a - nz b = b → nx a + (-nz -1) b =0

Hmm, so two equations:

( nz -1 ) a + nx b = 0 → equation 1

nx a + ( -nz -1 ) b = 0 → equation 2

I can write these as:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → equation1

nx a - (nz +1) b =0 → equation2 (I just multiplied by -1)

So, assuming a and b are not both zero, we can solve for a and b.

Let me write equation1: (nz -1) a = -nx b → a = [ -nx b ] / (nz -1 )

Substitute into equation2:

nx * [ -nx b / (nz -1) ] - (nz +1) b =0

Let me factor out b:

[ -nx^2 / (nz -1) - (nz +1) ] * b = 0

Since b can't be zero (else a would be zero, trivial solution), the term in brackets must be zero:

- nx^2 / (nz -1) - (nz +1) =0

Multiply both sides by (nz -1):

- nx^2 - (nz +1)(nz -1) =0

Wait, (nz +1)(nz -1) is nz^2 -1.

So:

- nx^2 - (nz^2 -1) =0 → nx^2 + nz^2 -1 = 0 → nx^2 + nz^2 =1

Ah, that's the condition because direction vectors are normalized. So, n is a unit vector, so nx^2 + nz^2 =1.

So, this condition holds. That means that the equations are consistent.

Thus, from equation1, a = [ -nx / (nz -1) ] b

But wait, perhaps I should express a in terms of b, and then find a ratio a/b.

Let me denote the ratio r = a/b.

So from equation1: (nz -1) r + nx =0 → r = -nx/(nz-1)

Similarly, from equation2: nx r - (nz +1) =0 → r = (nz +1)/nx

Wait, so two expressions for r:

r1 = -nx/(nz-1)

r2= (nz +1)/nx

Set them equal: -nx/(nz-1) = (nz +1)/nx

Multiply both sides by (nz -1) * nx:

-nx^2 = (nz +1)(nz -1)

Which is -nx^2 = nz^2 -1 → nz^2 -1 + nx^2 =0 → same as nx^2 + nz^2 =1, which is true. So, the two expressions for r are consistent.

Thus, r = a/b = -nx/(nz-1) = (nz +1)/nx

So, a = r b.

Now, the eigenvector can be written as [a, b] = [r b, b] = b [r, 1].

The eigenvector can be written as proportional to [r, 1].

But I need to find the actual values of a and b. Let me compute r.

r = (nz +1)/nx, from r2.

Wait, no, r is the same whether I use r1 or r2, given the condition holds.

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ r, 1 ].

But perhaps I should express r in terms of the angles. Since n is in the x-z plane,
