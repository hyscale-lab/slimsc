Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is the relativistic case, which probably means we have to consider how speed approaches the speed of light.

The problem states that we have a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed, v_max. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is v_max = Aω, where ω is the angular frequency. And ω is sqrt(k/m). So the non-rel speed would be sqrt(k/m)*A. But since this is relativistic, things change because of the Lorentz factor.

But wait, relativistic harmonic oscillators... I'm a bit rusty on that. I think in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx². Instead, the potential incorporates relativistic effects. Or maybe the kinetic energy does. Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator's equation of motion includes relativistic corrections.

Wait, another thought: In special relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc². But in oscillator problems, the potential and kinetic energy share the energy. Maybe in the relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc
