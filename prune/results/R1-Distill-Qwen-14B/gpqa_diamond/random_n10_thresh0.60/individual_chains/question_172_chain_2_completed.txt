Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. We need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE.

Wait, LTE is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here. Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n is the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given. Let's call it ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So for the iron atoms in star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So n1/n2 = 2, I think. But wait, I'm not sure if it's n1/n2 or n2/n1. Let me think. If star_1's atoms are more excited, that means a higher population in the excited state. So n_high for star_1 is higher than for star_2. So the ratio (n1_high / n1_low) compared to (n2_high / n2_low) would involve the temperatures.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that the excited atoms are twice as excited. So let's say the specific energy level is level i, and the lower level is j. So for star 1, the population in level i (n1) is twice as much as in star 2 (n2). So n1 = 2 * n2? Or wait, maybe it's (n1_i)/(n1_j) compared to (n2_i)/(n2_j). Because the ratio is (n_i)/(n_j) for each star.

So the ratio for star 1 is (n1_i)/(n1_j), for star 2 it's (n2_i)/(n2_j). And the problem states that the first ratio is twice the second, or that (n1_i/n1_j)/(n2_i/n2_j) = 2? Wait, no, the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in the specific energy level. So perhaps the ratio (n1_i)/(n1_j) is twice (n2_i)/(n2_j). Or maybe (n1_i)/(n_total_1) is twice (n2_i)/(n_total_2). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the key is that in the photosphere, the excitation level is determined by the Boltzmann factor. Let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E1 > E2. So the ratio of their populations is (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Assuming the statistical weights are the same for both stars, which they probably are, as it's the same element. So the ratio (n1_i)/(n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly for star 2, it's (n2_i)/(n2_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, does that mean (n1_i) is twice (n2_i), or (n1_i)/(n1_j) is twice (n2_i)/(n2_j)? Hmm, the wording says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think it's the latter. So (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i)/(n2_j).

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The excitation is about the proportion in the excited state. So if (n_i/n_j) is higher, that means more excitation. So for star_1, (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j). Because star_1's atoms are twice as excited in that level.

So putting that into the equations:

(n1_i/n1_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

(n2_i/n2_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio (n1_i/n1_j) / (n2_i/n2_j) )= [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, because when you divide two exponentials, a^b / a^c = a^{b-c}, so exp(x) / exp(y) = exp(x - y). So:

exp( ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, that's correct. So (n1_i/n1_j)/(n2_i/n2_j) = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

But according to the problem, (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j). So the ratio is 2.

So 2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, wait, 1/T2 minus 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me compute:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So substituting:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Rearranging, ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) divided by (T1 T2) multiplied by ΔE/(k).

Wait, but the options don't have ΔE in them. Hmm. Oh, but wait, in the question, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but that's probably Boltzmann's constant, since k = 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait! That's a hint. Because ΔE/(k) would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So (ΔE/(k)) = 1 K.

So substituting that:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So this becomes:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Which matches.

Wait, but option D says ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which is exactly what we have. So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann distribution is used to relate the relative populations of energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of energy levels \(i\) and \(j\), \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star 1 and star 2, the ratios of populations in the excited and lower energy levels are:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star 1 is twice that in star 2, meaning:

\[
\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}.
\]

Dividing the two equations gives:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{1i}}{n_{1j}}}{\frac{n_{2i}}{n_{2j}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting the ratio equal to 2:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches Boltzmann's constant \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K}\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
