Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the energy when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Alright, so I need to find the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the total energy isn't just kinetic; it's the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but wait, no, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Oh right, because E = gamma * m c squared.

So first, I should find gamma. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.96c. Let me compute gamma. Let me calculate v squared over c squared: (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately
