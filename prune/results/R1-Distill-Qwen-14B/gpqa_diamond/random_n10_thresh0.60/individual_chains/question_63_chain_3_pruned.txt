Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Let me start by understanding the question.

The molecule is made of elements X and Y. The quantum rotation-vibration model is used, so I think that means it's a non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for both rotation and vibration. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next higher state. But wait, what's the next state in terms of energy? Because in the rotation-vibration model, there are different energy levels. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. But since this is the non-rigid rotor, it's more complicated, but maybe for this problem, the main thing is to consider the vibrational state transition?

Hmm, the question mentions switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, wait, maybe it's referring to the vibrational transition. Because in molecules, the next state after the ground state (fundamental) is the first excited state, which is a higher vibrational state. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rotation transition.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. The next possible state would be the next higher energy state, which could be either vibration or rotation, whichever requires less energy. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, I think the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions. So the overall energy is a sum of both.

But to find the lowest energy photon needed, perhaps we're looking at the first possible transition. Let me think. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next possible state would be either n=1 (vibrational excitation) or J=1 (rotational excitation). Which of these requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between these states.

So I need to calculate the energy differences for both possibilities and see which is smaller.

First, I'll compute the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are given by the formula E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. The energy difference between n=0 and n=1 would be h w.

Then, the rotational energy levels in the rigid rotor model are E_rot = (J (J + 1) ħ² )/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So for the transition from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference would be E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = [ (2)(ħ²)/(2I) ) ] - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2 I) = ħ²/(I).

So I'll compute both E_vib (h w) and E_rot (ΔE_rot) and see which is smaller. The photon's energy must match the lower of the two, as that's the next possible state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is in the fundamental state (n=0, J=0), the next possible state could be either (n=1, J=0) or (n=0, J=1). Which one is higher in energy? So I need to calculate the energies for both possibilities and see which is lower.

So let's compute both.

First, compute E_vib for n=1: ΔE_vib = h w.

Given w=4e14 rad/s. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_vib = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, compute ΔE_rot from J=0 to J=1.
