Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. They're in LTE, so I guess I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)). So the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by (n2)/(n1) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), right?

Wait, but wait. Oh, in this case, the energy difference is given as E = 1.38e-23 J. So E = E2 - E1 or E1 - E2? Because if star_1 has more excited atoms, that level must be higher in energy. So maybe E is the difference between the two levels, E2 - E1 = delta E.

So for star_1, the population ratio is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = 2, since it's twice as excited. So for each star, the ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Wait no, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited compared to star_2. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2x that of star_2.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared
