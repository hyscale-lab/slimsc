Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about two energy levels with different lifetimes and their energy difference. Hmm. I remember something about lifetimes and the uncertainty principle.

Wait, the question says the lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So, the shorter the lifetime (Δt), the larger the uncertainty in energy (ΔE). 

But wait, in this case, the lifetimes are the widths of the energy levels, right? So the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime τ. The formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ). Let me get the numbers right. 

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But I need to convert that into eV·s. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s. Yeah, I remember that number because it's a common conversion factor. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let's compute that for both states.

First state: τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.
