Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given variation with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax relates to distance, so maybe I should start by recalling that relationship.

Wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So as the distance increases, parallax decreases. Got it.

The problem states that the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in would give N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that would be d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that seems like a big exponent. Does that make sense?

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so we're looking for the rate of change, like dN/dr. Hmm, but wait, the given relationship is an overall proportionality, not a differential. Maybe I need to think about how the number of stars scales with distance. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number density and how it relates to distance.

Alternatively, considering that the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr is the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density. Oh wait, but surface area is 4πr², and if the number density (N per volume) is given, then the number of stars in that shell would be N_volume * 4π r² dr. But in this problem, the variation is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is N ∝ d^5 since plx is 1/d.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me restate the given information: the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, and is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. 

So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/(plx)^5 = (1/(1/d))^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.
