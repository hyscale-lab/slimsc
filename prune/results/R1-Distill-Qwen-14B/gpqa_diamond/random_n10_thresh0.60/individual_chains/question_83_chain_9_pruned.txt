Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. So, first, let me read the problem again carefully.

We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Alright, first, I think I need to find out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, I can figure out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me think. The initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be (volume1 * concentration1) / total volume. So, M1V1 = M2V2. So, 0.05 M * 0.002 L = M2 * 0.004 L. So M2 = (0.05 * 0.002) / 0.004 = 0.025 M. Wait, let me compute that: 0.05 * 0.002 is 0.0001, divided by 0.004 is 0.025. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Okay, now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the equivalence point?

The volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence can be found by the formula: M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is the concentration of acetic acid (0.025 M), V1 is the volume (0.04 L), and M2 is the NaOH concentration (0.1 M). So, V2 = (M1 * V1) / M2. Let's plug in the numbers: 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Then, V2 = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question asks for 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. Wait, the 25% titration refers to the amount of acid that's been
