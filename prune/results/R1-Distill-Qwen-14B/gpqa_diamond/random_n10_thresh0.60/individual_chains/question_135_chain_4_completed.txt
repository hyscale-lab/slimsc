Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure this out. 

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term involving a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf fbar ψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, wait, I think I misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh, right, the interaction term is probably something like L = -λ [f ψ̄ f (y) (something) ψf(y)]. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. 

Wait, the mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the possible decays of X at the lowest order. The options suggest various fermion-antifermion pairs, like b bbar, c cbar, etc. 

So, in particle physics, when a boson decays into fermions, the mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermions involved. Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², and in decay processes, the rest mass energy has to be sufficient to produce the particles. 

So first, I need to know the masses of the fermions. Let's recall the approximate masses of the quarks and leptons. 

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2 MeV
- Down (d): ~4 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV (105.7 MeV)
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible, but they aren't in the options, so probably not relevant here.

So the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So, for a decay X → ff̄, the sum of the masses of the fermions must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Also, the fermions must be such that their mass is each less than 3 GeV (since each would need to be at most half of 6 GeV, but actually, since the sum is twice the mass, each can be up to 3 GeV, but the total for both must be ≤6 GeV.

Wait, wait, actually, the condition is that the rest mass energy must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. So for X to decay into a pair of fermions, each must have a mass m such that 2m ≤ 6 GeV. So m ≤3 GeV.

Looking at the possible fermions:

Electron (e): 0.5 MeV → way below 3 GeV → allowed.
Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV → allowed.
Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV → allowed, since 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait wait, no, wait. No, wait: Wait, X is 6 GeV. So for a pair like tau+ tau-, each tau is about 1.78 GeV. So sum is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So that's allowed.

Now, quarks:

u: 2 MeV → allowed.
d: 4 MeV → allowed.
s: 100 MeV → allowed.
c: ~1.5 GeV → 2*1.5=3 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
b: ~4.5 GeV → 2*4.5=9 GeV >6 GeV → Not allowed.
t: way too heavy, 173 GeV → way over.

So the quarks allowed are u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait: the problem is about X decaying into ff̄. But wait, for quarks, they can't exist freely because of confinement. So when a boson decays into quark-antiquark pairs, those quarks would hadronize into jets. But for the purpose of allowed decay channels, whether the fermions are quarks or leptons doesn't change the kinematic condition, only the existence of the decay. So we have to consider the possibility regardless of whether they can be observed directly.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u ū
d d̄
s s̄
c c̄

Wait, but what about the mass of X? X is 6 GeV, so for c quark, 1.5 GeV each. 2*1.5=3 GeV <6 GeV → allowed. 

But wait, the bottom quark is 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5=9 GeV which is more than 6 GeV → not allowed. So X can't decay into b bbar.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, e+ e-

Wait, but X can't decay into b bbar because 2*4.5=9>6. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e.

So this includes c cbar (allowed), s, u, d, which are all allowed. So the possible decay channels are: c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term given in the problem is L = -λ f fbar ψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure of the interaction. The term looks like a Yukawa coupling. The general form is L ~ g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson. So the fermion ψ must be a Dirac fermion, and the interaction would allow decay into that fermion and its antiparticle.

But in the problem statement, the interaction term is written as -λ f (y) ψ_f (y) [upsilon + X(y)] ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should think about which fermions are involved. Oh, wait, perhaps the fermion fields ψ_f are the ones that interact with X. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that ψ_f represents. 

But wait, the problem is about the allowed decays of X based on mass, regardless of the specific interactions. Because the interaction term determines which fermions it can decay into based on which ones are present in the Lagrangian. But the problem's options include various possibilities, so perhaps the interaction is such that all fermions can couple to X, or perhaps only some.

Wait, the problem statement says "The interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by...", so the Lagrangian is the general term for all possible fermions? Or is it a specific term for a specific fermion? Because the way it's written is a bit confusing. 

Wait, the given Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f fbar ψf(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, perhaps that's a typo, or maybe it's meant to be a general term. Alternatively, perhaps the term is L = -λ \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), which would be a Yukawa interaction where the fermion ψ_f couples to X. 

But regardless, the question is about possible decays, which is determined by the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. Because even if a fermion isn't in the interaction term, the decay wouldn't happen. But in this case, the problem gives the interaction term as involving a fermion ψ_f. So perhaps ψ_f is a specific fermion, like a lepton or a quark, but that would limit the possible decays. But the options suggest that X can decay into multiple different fermion pairs, which would imply that the interaction is with multiple fermions. 

Wait, perhaps the interaction is written as -λ f̄ (y) (v + X(y)) f(y), where f is a generic fermion field, meaning that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair. But then, considering the mass limits, only certain pairs are allowed.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are present in the interaction. It just gives a generic form, which suggests that X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass condition is satisfied. So the possible decays would be all the fermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So, back to the allowed fermion pairs.

Electron: allowed.

Muon: allowed.

Tau: allowed because 2*1.78=3.56 GeV <6 GeV.

For quarks:

u: allowed.

d: allowed.

s: allowed.

c: allowed.

b: 4.5 GeV each → sum 9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

t: way too heavy, so no.

So the allowed fermion pairs are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

So looking at the options:

Option A: includes b bbar → not allowed. So wrong.

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e. So all allowed except the b.

Wait, option B: "c\bar{c},s\bar{s},u\bar{u},d\bar{d},\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-}" → yes, that's all allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t. But t is 173 GeV → can't decay into t tbar. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b bbar → not allowed, so wrong.

So the correct options are B and possibly others. Wait, looking again:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that's all the allowed decays.

So in the options, option B is X → c cbar, s sbar, u u, d d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but the option in B is written as X→ c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-}.

Yes, so option B is correct.

Other options either include b (A, D) or t (C) which are not allowed.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays are governed by the mass constraint \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion pair \( f\bar{f} \). The allowed fermion pairs are determined by their masses:

- **Electron (\( e \))**: \( m_e \approx 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
- **Muon (\( \mu \))**: \( m_\mu \approx 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
- **Tau (\( \tau \))**: \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed (\( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- **Up quark (\( u \))**: \( m_u \approx 2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
- **Down quark (\( d \))**: \( m_d \approx 4 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
- **Strange quark (\( s \))**: \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.
- **Charm quark (\( c \))**: \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed (\( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (\( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
- **Top quark (\( t \))**: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.

From this analysis, the allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \). 

Now, evaluating the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
