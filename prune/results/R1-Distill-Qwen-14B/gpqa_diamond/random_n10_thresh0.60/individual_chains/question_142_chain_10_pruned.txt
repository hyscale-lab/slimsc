Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so I need to think this through.

The question gives me a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

Wait, right, a density matrix is usually represented as a square matrix, right? So for a qubit, which is a two-level system, the density matrix would be 2x2. I think for the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩, the outer products are just the projectors onto those states.

So let's break down this ρ. Each term is (1/2) times the outer product of |0⟩ and ⟨0|, and similarly for |1⟩. So when you expand that, the density matrix should have 1/2 in the (0,0) and (1,1) positions, and zeros elsewhere.

Let me write that out. The first term is |0⟩⟨0|, which is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Multiplying by 1/2 gives 1/2 in (0,0) and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, the |1⟩⟨1| term has 1 in the bottom-right corner, so when multiplied by 1/2, it's 1/2 in (1,1). Adding these together, the density matrix ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Which means it's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries equal to 1/2. 

Now the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. The options are given as r vectors in three dimensions: (1,1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,0), (1,1,1). Hmm, wait, where does this come from? Oh, right, I remember that qubit states can be represented as vectors in a Bloch sphere, which is a 3D representation. But wait, density matrices are more general than pure states, so their representation is a bit different.

I think the Bloch sphere representation is for pure states, described by a state vector, while mixed states are represented by points in the Bloch ball, which is a 3D space. The density matrix ρ can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where I is the identity matrix, σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So expanding this, we have:

ρ = (1/2) [I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z]

Which when written out as a matrix, becomes:

ρ = 1/2 * [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
             [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z] ]

So, comparing this with our given ρ, which is diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal and 0 off-diagonal:

Our ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

So looking at the diagonal elements, the (0,0) element is (1 + r_z)/2, and the (1,1) element is (1 - r_z)/2. Wait, no, wait a second. Let me double-check. The general form I wrote earlier has:

(1 + r_z)/2 in (0,0), and (1 - r_z)/2 in (1,1). So for our ρ, both diagonal elements are 1/2. Therefore,

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0. 

Similarly, the (1,1) element is (1 - r_z)/2: same thing, 1 - r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

So r_z
