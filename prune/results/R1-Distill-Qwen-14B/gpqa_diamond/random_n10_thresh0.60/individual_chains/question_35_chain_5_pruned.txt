Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this step by step.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific matrix. The first row of S is (0 -i), second row is (i 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Then, from the options, pick the correct statement.

Wait, first, what do I know about angular momentum operators? Oh right, in quantum mechanics, angular momentum components like L_x, L_y, L_z are hermitian operators. But wait, A_y here is given as c multiplied by this matrix S. So maybe S is a matrix representation of some operator, not necessarily hermitian.

Wait, the matrix S given is:
Row 1: 0  -i
Row 2: i  0

Let me write that out:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Is S a hermitian matrix? Let me check. A hermitian matrix is equal to its conjugate transpose. The conjugate transpose of S would swap the off-diagonals and take the complex conjugate. So S^dagger would be:

[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Which is not the same as S. So S is not hermitian. But wait, A_y is given as c·S. Since c is a real constant, A_y isn't hermitian either. Hmm, but wait, angular momentum operators should be hermitian because they correspond to observables. Wait, but A is the intrinsic angular momentum (like spin), which is an observable, so A_y should be hermitian. So maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine S. Wait, the Pauli matrices are hermitian. The Pauli Y matrix is usually i times S? Let me think. Oh, wait, the standard Pauli Y matrix is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], which is exactly the S given here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is hermitian. Wait, no, wait, is the Pauli matrix Y hermitian? Because the Pauli matrices are hermitian. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is hermitian. So A_y should be hermitian because c is real and S is hermitian.

Wait, c is h/(4π), which is a real positive constant. So yes, A_y is hermitian.

So the next step is to find the eigenvalues of A_y. Since A_y is 2x2, it's manageable.

A_y = c * S = c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So let me compute the matrix A_y:

A_y = (h/4π) * S = (h/4π) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Hmm, but wait, when you multiply a matrix by a scalar, you just multiply each element. So each element of S is multiplied by c.

So A_y = [ [0, -(i h)/(4π) ], [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the
