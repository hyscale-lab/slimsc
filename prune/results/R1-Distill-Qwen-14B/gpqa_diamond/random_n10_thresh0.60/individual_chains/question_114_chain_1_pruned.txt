Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let me read it again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. So, butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN is providing the cyanide ion as a nucleophile. The product formed is a secondary alcohol nitrile. Wait, wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the mechanism. Oh right, the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon in a ketone, leading to an addition. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions.

Wait, but wait, another thought: Maybe it's a condensation reaction. Oh wait, no, that's for aldehydes and ketones forming enolates. Wait, no, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. So, in a ketone, the alpha position is where the addition would happen. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN is added, the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an addition product. But wait, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN would typically form (CH3)2C(OH)CN, but wait, that's what the product is. So, the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

But how does the reaction proceed? I think that the reaction requires an acid catalyst. Because the cyanide ion is a good nucleophile, but under basic conditions, maybe. Wait, but wait, in some cases, the addition of a nitrile to a ketone requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. That would help the nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. No, substitution in ketones isn't common. So, considering addition
