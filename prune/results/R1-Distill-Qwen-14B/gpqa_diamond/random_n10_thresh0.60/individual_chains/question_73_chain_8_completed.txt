Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things are a bit different from classical mechanics, so I can't just add speeds normally.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds. I think I have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²), right? But wait, because both are moving in the same direction, so u is the speed of the first astronaut (0.6c), and v is the speed of the second (0.5c). So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²]. Let me compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²/c²) which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that's the relative speed part.

Now, for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. Wait, no. Wait, the total energy of each is gamma times m c squared. So the total energy of the system is the sum of their individual energies.

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v is 0.6c, so v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 is about 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options:

Option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That matches our calculations. Option D has E=5 mc², which is less than what we calculated. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is the sum of their rest energy (\( mc^2 \)) and their relativistic kinetic energy. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass = \( 2m \), speed = \( 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy = \( 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5mc^2 \)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass = \( 3m \), speed = \( 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy = \( 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2 \)

Adding the two energies:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**
