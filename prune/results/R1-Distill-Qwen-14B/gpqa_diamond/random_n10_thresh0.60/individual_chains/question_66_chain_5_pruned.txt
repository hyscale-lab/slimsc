Okay, so I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that effective field theories are used when you have a high energy scale and you integrate out the heavy fields, leaving you with an effective theory at lower energies.

Now, the question is about symmetries that operators must respect. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Oh right, Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts, while Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations (so momentum conservation is part of it). But do all operators in SMEFT have to respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it automatically included?

In SMEFT, the operators are built as dimension-6 operators (I think) from the Standard Model fields. These operators must form a renormalizable theory, so they should respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, SU(3), SU(2), U(1) symmetries, and also respects CP symmetry? Wait, no, the Standard Model actually doesn't respect CP symmetry in general. Wait, because of the CKM matrix, there's CP violation.

But wait, in the SMEFT framework, the operators are constructed from the SM fields. So operators must be invariant under the same symmetries as the SM, except when considering beyond SM effects
