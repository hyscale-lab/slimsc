Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The i here is the imaginary unit, square root of -1. When they measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the probability of finding a particle is zero for x less than 1 and greater than 3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. The probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of the probability density over that region. Since no particles were found outside x=1 and x=3, that means the probability of finding them in x<1 or x>3 is zero. So, the wave function must satisfy certain boundary conditions, probably that the probability current is zero at x=1 and x=3, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the wave function is zero or has certain properties at these boundaries. Oh, right! For particles in a box or infinite potential well, the wave functions are zero at the boundaries. But in this case, the setup is a bit different. The particle is confined between x=1 and x=3, so maybe the wave function should be zero at those points.

So, let's write down the wave function: ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i.

If the wave function must be zero at x=1 and x=3, then plugging in x=1, ψ(1) = a/sqrt(2) - 0.5i = 0. Similarly, ψ(3) = a/sqrt(4) - 0.5i = a/2 - 0.5i = 0.

Wait, but if ψ(1)=0, then both the real and imaginary parts must be zero. So, setting the real part to zero: a/sqrt(2) = 0. But a can't be zero because then the wave function would just be -0.5i everywhere, which can't be normalized. That doesn't make sense. So maybe my initial thought is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function doesn't have to be zero at the boundaries but must instead be such that the probability is zero there. Wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

But if the particles aren't found outside x=1 and x=3, that means the probability of finding them there is zero. So the probability density must be zero in those regions. But the wave function as given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. The modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25), because (a/sqrt(1+x))² is (a²)/(1+x), and the imaginary part squared is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. Wait, no, actually, the modulus squared is [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]². So in this case, it's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (-0.5)^2. So [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right because if the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, then the probability density would have to be zero in those regions. But according to this, the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. So for x <1, let's say x=0: [a²/1] + 0.25. That would mean the probability density is a² + 0.25, which is positive. But the problem says no particles were found there. So that implies the probability density must be zero for x<1 and x>3. But with the given wave function, that's not happening.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, but the given expression is only valid within that region. So the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. But then the question is asking for 'a' such that the wave function is properly normalized.

Ah, that makes sense. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1 (since it's a probability distribution).

So |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. Wait, no, wait. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. Because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part, and -0.5i is the imaginary part. So [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So that's (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

Wait, but to get the normalization right, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ|^2 dx should be 1. So:

Integral from 1 to 3 [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me split this integral into two parts:

Integral (a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3 + Integral 0.25 dx from 1 to3 = 1.

Let me compute each part.

The first integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to3.

∫ dx/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 /0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So I think the correct answer is B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), we split the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx.
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two integrals:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
