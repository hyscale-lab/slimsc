Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about how the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the bigger the parallax, the closer the star is, right? Because parallax decreases as distance increases.

So the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. I think I need to convert this into a function of distance. Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, I can write plx as k/d, where k is some constant. Oh wait, actually, the formula for distance in parsecs is d = 1/plx. So plx = 1/d. That makes sense.

So if I substitute plx with 1/d, then the number of stars N is proportional to 1/( (1/d)^5 ). Let me calculate that. 1 divided by (1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, and the reciprocal is d^5.

Wait, so N ‚àù d^5. But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so it's the number density per unit distance. Wait, no, maybe it's the number of stars as a function of distance. Or wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find how the number per unit volume changes with distance.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = C * (1/plx)^5, where C is
