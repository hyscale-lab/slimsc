Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, mathematically, I think that's N ∝ 1/px^5, where N is the number of stars and px is the parallax.

Wait, right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Oh, right, because parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So px = 1/d, which means that distance d is 1/px. So if px gets bigger, the distance is smaller, right? Because if a star is closer, its parallax is higher.

So the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The question is asking about the number of stars per unit range of distance. I'm a bit confused about what exactly it's asking. Maybe it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at a distance r, considering a small change in r.

Let me think. If N is proportional to 1/px^5, and since px is 1/d, substituting that in would make N proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm. So maybe it's about the number of stars in a given volume as you go further out.

Wait, but wait. Let me think in terms of integration. If the number of stars varies as 1/px^5, then perhaps we can express this in terms of distance. Since px = 1/d, then 1/px^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the number of stars in a thin shell (like a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr) would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin shell is 4πr² dr. So if the number of stars in that shell is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance dr would be 4πr² dr multiplied by some function of r.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the number of stars varies as 1/px^5. So perhaps the number density of stars (stars per unit volume) is proportional to 1/px^5. Because number per volume would be N/V, and if N ∝ 1/px^5, then perhaps the number density is proportional to that.

Wait, no.
