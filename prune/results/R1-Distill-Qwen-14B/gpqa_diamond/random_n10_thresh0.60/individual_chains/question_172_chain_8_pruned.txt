Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann equation and the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. Oh right, when atoms are in an excited state, it's about their energy levels. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of the populations (n_upper / n_lower) equals exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So for the two stars, star 1 and star 2, the ratio of their excited states would be given by this equation.

In star 1, the excitation is twice that of star 2. So n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 times (n_upper2 / n_lower2). Or maybe I should write it as n1 = 2 * n2. Wait, no, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio of the excited state population to some other state might be double. Hmm.

Let me define the variables correctly. Let’s say for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (upper energy level) to those in the lower state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) and for star 2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Given that the excitation in star 1 is twice that of star 2, which would mean (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower). So that would be exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Wait, no, because if star 1 has twice as many excited atoms, then the population ratio for star 1 is higher. Wait, actually, the number of excited atoms depends on both the ratio and the total number of atoms. But assuming that the lower level has the same number for both stars, or maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the ratios. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the populations is given by the Boltzmann factor.
