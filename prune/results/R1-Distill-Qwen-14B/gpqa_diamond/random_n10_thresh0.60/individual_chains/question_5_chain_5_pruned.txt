Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So in this case, the operator is P, and we’re looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh right, that means the direction is in the x-z plane, so the vector n has components (nx, 0, nz). Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I think the operator P can be written as a vector in terms of these components, something like P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I should probably write down the matrix form of P and then solve for its eigenvectors.

Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So:
P_x = [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So:
P_y = [[0, -(iħ)/2], (iħ)/2, 0]

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So:
P_z = [[(ħ/2), 0], [0, -(ħ/2)]]

Since n is in the x-z plane, P can be written as:
P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z

But wait, is n a unit vector? Because the eigenvalue is ħ/2, which suggests the operator's eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So if n is a unit vector, then n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Let me represent n as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, a unit vector in the x-z plane would have φ=0, because it's in the x-z plane. So maybe it's better to write n as (cosθ, 0, sinθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no, because if θ is measured from the z-axis, then the x-component would be sinθ cosφ, but since φ=0 (because it's in the x-z plane), the x-component is sinθ. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ)? Or is it the other way around? Wait, let me think. The usual polar coordinates: the unit vector in the z direction is (0,0,1). If θ is measured from the z-axis, then the x-component is sinθ cosφ. So for φ=
