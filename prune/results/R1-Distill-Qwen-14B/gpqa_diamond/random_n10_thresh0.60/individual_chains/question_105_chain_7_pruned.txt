Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about figuring out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as a star with spots. Hmm, I remember that starspots can cause dips in brightness when they rotate into and out of view, similar to how a planet would block some light when transiting. But the math part is a bit fuzzy for me.

Alright, let's break down the problem. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so Rstar is solar radius. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered in spots, with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor, I think, is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So 20% of the star's surface area has cooler spots.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. I guess that means the spots are 5000 K since the star's Teff is 6000 K. Wait, no, the temperature difference is 1000 K. So if the star is 6000 K, the spots are either 7000 or 5000. But spots are usually cooler, right? So probably 5000 K.

So the star's brightness variation is due to these spots rotating. When the star spins, the spots come into view and then go out of view. The change in brightness should depend on the spots' area and their temperature compared to the rest of the star.

I remember that the flux from a star (or part of it) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, but when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, they reduce the total flux because they're cooler. But when the star rotates, the spots move out of view, increasing the flux. So the variation in brightness is due to the spots' contribution changing as the star rotates.

But the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So they're asking, what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

So phot
