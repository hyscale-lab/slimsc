Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric determines the geometry of the space. This looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx² and dy². 

Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, is this metric representing a pseudosphere? Or maybe it's a different kind of surface. I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think about the form of the metric. The general form for a surface of revolution can sometimes be written in terms of r and θ, but here it's written in terms of x and y. Wait, maybe it's similar to the Poincaré disk model? Because the Poincaré disk has a metric that's conformally flat, which this seems to be.

The standard Poincaré disk metric is usually written as ds² = (4/(1 - (x² + y²))) (dx² + dy²). But wait, in that case, the radius of the disk is related to the curvature. The metric given here has 32 in the numerator, so maybe it's scaled differently.

Wait, the given metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 - x²
