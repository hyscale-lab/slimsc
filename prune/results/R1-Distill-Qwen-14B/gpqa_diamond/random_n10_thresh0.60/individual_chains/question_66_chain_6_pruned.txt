Okay, so I've got this question here about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that includes the Standard Model (SM) as a subset and allows for higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the SM physics. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions and which ones are fundamental. Let me think.

First, I know that Lorentz symmetry is crucial in relativity. Operators in the theory must respect Lorentz symmetry because the theory is supposed to be Lorentz invariant. So SMEFT operators should transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations. That means Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Oh right, Poincare includes both rotations, boosts, and translations. But wait, in a theory, it's more about the symmetry of the action. The SM action is Poincare invariant. However, SMEFT is an effective theory. Effective theories usually keep the symmetries of the underlying theory. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT should too. So do all SMEFT operators respect Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit confused because sometimes higher-dimension operators might not respect some symmetries, but wait no, SMEFT preserves the same symmetries as the SM, right? Because any symmetry breaking would come from the new physics, but in the effective theory, you don't break the SM symmetries. So Poincare must be respected as well. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

CP symmetry is another thing. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM isn't CP symmetric, right? Because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So in the SM, CP is not a symmetry. Therefore, the SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The SM does respect CPT symmetry. And since SMEFT is built on top of the SM, the effective operators must respect CPT as well. Because if the underlying theory respects CPT, the effective theory built from it must too. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct
