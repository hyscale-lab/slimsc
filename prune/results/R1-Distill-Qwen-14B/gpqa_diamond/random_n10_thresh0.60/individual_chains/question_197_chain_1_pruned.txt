Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. We have the IR and NMR data for Compound X, and we need to figure out what it is, then predict the product after that reaction.

First, let's look at the spectroscopic data.

Starting with the IR data:

- 3400–2500 cm-1: That's a broad region, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Since there's a strong peak around 1720 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group like a ketone, ester, or maybe an acid. But 1720 is more likely ester or ketone. Wait, but if it's an acid, the O-H would be around 2500-3000, maybe as a broad peak. Hmm.

Wait, the IR also has peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm^-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So that suggests there's an aromatic ring in the compound.

So putting that together, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester or a ketone, but also has an O-H group. Wait, but 1720 is a strong carbonyl. Another possibility is that it's a benzoic acid derivative. Because benzoic acid would have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which is in the 3400–2500 region. The 1720 would be the carboxylic acid carbonyl. But wait, no, carboxylic acids usually have O-H around 2500-3000 and their carbonyl is around 1700. But maybe the 3400–2500 is a broad peak, which would fit an O-H in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone and another O-H from an alcohol or something else.

Then the NMR data:

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Broad suggests maybe an exchangeable proton, like an OH. Since it's at 10.5, which is upfield for an O-H, but maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols are usually lower ppm, maybe around 1-5, but carboxylic acids are around 10-12, so that fits. So that 10.5 is likely a -COOH proton.

Wait, but wait, the 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs), 1H. That's most likely a carboxylic acid proton. So the compound has a -COOH group.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's typical for a para-substituted benzene, like para-substituted aromatic ring. So two doublets, each integrating to 2H, probably a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but in the case of
