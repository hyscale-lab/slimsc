Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think through it.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization. Regularization usually refers to a method used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff, then removing it in the end. So, which theories don't need this?

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that QED is a quantum theory and has things like the Casimir effect and renormalization. Renormalization is kind of like dealing with the infinities, right? So QED does need regularization because it has loop diagrams that cause divergences. Like electron self-energy loops and things. So option C, QED, requires regularization. So the answer isn't C.

Quantum Chromodynamics is the theory of the strong force. I think QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. Because of asymptotic freedom, the coupling gets weaker at high energies, which means that at high energies, quarks behave almost like free particles. Wait, but does QCD require regularization? I thought that QCD doesn't have the same issues as QED because of things like confinement and maybe the running coupling. But I'm not sure. Wait, QCD loops would also have divergences, so I
