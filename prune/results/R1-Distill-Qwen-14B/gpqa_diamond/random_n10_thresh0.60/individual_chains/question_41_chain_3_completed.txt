Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer. Oh and c is taken as 1, so that simplifies things a bit.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. So normally, if the glass isn't moving, the speed would be c/n, which is 1/n since c=1 here. But since the glass is moving, does that affect the observed speed?

But wait, I think about relativity here. Oh right, the speed of light is constant in any inertial frame, according to Einstein's theory. So even if the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame should still be c, right? Wait, but wait—light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So would the Doppler effect come into play here?

Hmm, maybe not directly. Because the Doppler effect is about the frequency or wavelength change due to relative motion, not the speed of light itself. So the speed of the light wave relative to the observer shouldn't change, because nothing can exceed c, and in any inertial frame, light must travel at c.

Wait, but wait another thing. The glass is moving, so from the lab frame, how does that affect the medium through which the light is propagating? Because in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is 1/n. But when the glass moves, is there a Galilean addition here?

Wait, Galilean transformations are for non-relativistic speeds, but let's see. If the glass is moving at velocity v, then according to Galilean addition, the speed of the light in the lab frame would be (u' + v), where u' is the speed in the glass's frame. But wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is 1/n. So would the lab frame see it as (1/n) + v?

Wait, no, that can't be right because if the glass is moving at, say, 0.9c, then adding that to 1/n (which is maybe 1.5 if n=1.5) would give more than c, which is impossible. So this approach must be wrong because relativity doesn't allow that.

So maybe I should think about it using special relativity. The speed of light in any inertial frame is always c, regardless of the source's motion. So even though the glass is moving, the light's speed relative to the observer is still c.

Wait, but wait again. The question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed is 1/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the motion of the medium. For example, if a medium is moving, does that change the speed of light in that medium as observed from another frame?

Wait, when the medium is moving, the refractive index might change as observed in the lab frame. Or maybe the index of refraction is a property that's frame-dependent. Hmm, but in reality, the refractive index is a material property and doesn't change with the motion of the medium, right? Because in relativity, material properties are frame-dependent only in certain ways. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, no, maybe not. Because in relativity, the refractive index depends on the material's response to electromagnetic fields, which would transform under Lorentz transformations. So perhaps the refractive index is not the same in all frames.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again. The problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. But the light is already in the glass, so in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is 1/n. If the glass is moving, then from the lab frame, the light's speed would be... Hmm.

Wait, maybe using the relativistic velocity addition formula. The velocity addition formula says that if an object has velocity u in the frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u in frame S is (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). But since c=1, that simplifies to (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

In this scenario, the frame S' is the glass's rest frame. In S', the light is moving at u' = 1/n. So applying the velocity addition formula, the speed in the lab frame S would be (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)*v).

Hmm, let's compute that. So the numerator is (1 + n v)/n, and the denominator is (n + v)/n. So the entire expression becomes [(1 + n v)/n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Wait, because the n in numerator and denominator cancels out.

So that would give (1 + n v)/(n + v). Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Hmm, but wait, isn't the speed of light supposed to be c=1 in any frame? So why is this giving a different value? Because maybe the velocity addition formula isn't the right approach here.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The velocity addition formula applies when you're considering the velocity of an object in different frames. But in the scenario here, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light should always be measured as c in any inertial frame. So regardless of the glass's motion, the speed of light in the lab frame should be 1. So why is the velocity addition formula giving a different answer?

Ah, perhaps because I'm mixing up the frames. The light's speed in the glass's frame is 1/n, but when we apply the velocity addition, maybe we're getting the speed as observed in the lab. But according to relativity, that shouldn't be possible because light's speed can't be more than c.

Wait, wait a minute. If the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at 1/n in the glass's frame in the same direction as v, then according to the lab frame, the light's speed would perhaps be ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ). So let's compute that.

Let me take n as the refractive index. Let's say for example, n=1.5 and v is 0.5 (assuming units where c=1). Then 1/n is approximately 0.6667. So (0.6667 + 0.5)/(1 + (0.6667 * 0.5)) = (1.1667)/(1 + 0.33335) = 1.1667 / 1.33335 ≈ 0.875, which is less than 1. But according to relativity, the observed speed should be 1. So there's a contradiction here. That suggests that my approach is wrong.

Hmm, maybe the error is in assuming that the speed of light in the glass's frame is 1/n. Because in reality, when the glass is moving, does the refractive index change? Or perhaps the way the light propagates is different.

Wait, another approach: the refractive index is a property of the medium and depends on the material's response to the electric and magnetic fields. So if the medium is moving, its refractive index might not be the same as when it's at rest. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the refractive index in the lab frame is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the glass is always c, regardless of the glass's motion. But that can't be right because from the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed would be the same as c. So the speed of light in the glass (as observed in the lab) would still be 1.

Wait, but that can't be the case because the glass is moving. If the glass is moving at velocity v, then if in the glass's frame the light's speed is 1/n, then in the lab frame, it's (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n) v ) as I thought before. But according to relativity, this should equal c=1. So let's set up the equation:

( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ) = 1.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

(1/n) + v = 1 + (v/n).

Simplify:

(1 + n v)/n = 1 + v/n.

Multiply both sides by n:

1 + n v = n + v.

Which simplifies to 1 + n v = n + v.

Hmm, bringing all terms to one side:

n v - v = n -1.

v (n -1) = (n -1).

So if n≠1, then v=1. But this would imply that the glass is moving at the speed of light, which is impossible. So this suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect, and that the velocity addition formula doesn't apply here. Therefore, perhaps the speed of the light is always c=1, regardless of the glass's motion.

Wait, but then the problem states that the light is propagating through the glass. So in the glass's frame, the speed is 1/n. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the light's speed is still c=1. So in that case, the correct answer would be B) 1.

But wait, why would the velocity addition formula give a different answer? Oh, because the velocity addition formula applies to objects moving at speeds much less than c. But in reality, the speed of light is always c in any frame, so the velocity addition formula is not applicable here because the speed of light doesn't change.

So putting it all together, the correct answer must be B) 1.


The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory frame, where the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam. The refractive index of the glass is \( n \), and the speed of light in a vacuum is \( c = 1 \).

Key considerations:

1. **Relativity of the Speed of Light**: According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant (\( c = 1 \)) in all inertial frames, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. This principle suggests that the speed of light in the lab frame should remain \( c = 1 \), even if the glass is moving.

2. **Velocity Addition Formula**: The relativistic velocity addition formula is often used to calculate the speed of an object in one frame relative to another. For an object moving at speed \( u' \) in a frame \( S' \) (moving at speed \( v \) relative to \( S \)), the speed in \( S \) is:
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u'v}.
   \]
   If the speed of light in the glass's rest frame is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), applying the formula would yield:
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}} = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}.
   \]
   However, this result contradicts the principle of relativity, which states that the speed of light must always be \( c = 1 \) in any inertial frame.

3. **Refractive Index and Medium Motion**: The refractive index \( n \) is a property of the medium and does not change with its motion. Even though the glass is moving, the speed of light in the lab frame remains \( c = 1 \), as the speed of light is invariant under Lorentz transformations.

4. **Conclusion**: The speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory frame is always \( c = 1 \), regardless of the glass's motion. The velocity addition formula is not applicable here because it does not account for the invariance of the speed of light in special relativity.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
