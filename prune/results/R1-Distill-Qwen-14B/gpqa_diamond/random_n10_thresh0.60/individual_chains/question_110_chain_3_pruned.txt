Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that both instruments have different brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can see stars up to about 17 mag. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so up to around 16 mag. So, a star needs to have an apparent V magnitude (mv) that's less than or equal to 16 mag to be detected by HIRES, and less than or equal to 17 mag for ESPRESSO. But wait, wait, because the question says which can be detected with both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be bright enough for both. So the apparent V mag must be ≤16, because if it's brighter than 16 (like 15) it's within both. But if it's 17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. So the star's apparent V mag must be ≤16.

Now let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute magnitude (Mv) is 15.5 mag, located at 10 pc. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 pc. Since it's at 10 pc, the apparent V magnitude is the same as absolute, so mv=15.5. That's brighter than 16, so both can see it? Wait, because ESPRESSO goes up to 17, so yes, it can be seen by both. Because 15.5 is less than 16 and 17.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude is 16.5. So that's exactly 16.5. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.5 is okay for ESPRESSO. But HIRES can't go beyond 16, so this star is magnitude 16.5 which is fainter than 16. So HIRES can't see it. So Star2 can't be detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag. Wait, but wait, the note says that there's extinction (E(B-V)=0.6). The total absorption in V band is 3.1 times E(B-V). So the actual apparent magnitude is affected. Wait, the star's given apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that's after extinction? Or
