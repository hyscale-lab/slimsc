Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about coordination chemistry and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is, right? The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait. Stability constants usually increase with the order of the complex, like β1 for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So Co(SCN)n^2-? I think n goes from 1 to 4 here.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I remember that the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)]2- complex, which is the dithiocyanato complex. So that's the Co with two SCN- ligands. But wait, wait, what's the actual formula? Oh right, the first complex is [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1?), no, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. For Co(II), each SCN- is a ligand. So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+ for n=1 (since Co^2+ plus one SCN^- gives charge 2+ -1 = +1), [Co(SCN)2]^0 for n=
