Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can rotate and vibrate, and their energy states are quantized. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state. Let me try to break this down.

First, the molecule is made of atoms X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. 

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the next state would be the next higher energy state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the states are quantized in both rotation and vibration. So the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies.

But the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. I'm a bit confused about whether it's a pure rotational transition or a vibrational one, or a combination. Oh wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." The next state would be the one with the next higher energy, which could involve either a vibrational or rotational change. But in the quantum mechanical models, transitions can involve changes in both, but the selection rules determine which transitions are allowed.

Wait, but for the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps we're considering both rotation and vibration. Alternatively, maybe the model being referred to is the rigid rotor plus vibration. Hmm.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The term "fundamental state" in molecular vibrations refers to the lowest vibrational state, n=0, with rotational quantum number R=0. So transitioning to the next state could involve a vibrational transition to n=1, or a rotational transition (like from R=0 to R=
