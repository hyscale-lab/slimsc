Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, right. I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance d in parsecs. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d. So as distance d increases, parallax decreases.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, let's substitute plx with 1/d. Because plx = 1/d, so 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, I think this is about the number of stars in a shell of radius r, like a thin spherical shell at distance r. So the number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume of that shell and the density of stars.

But wait, the number of stars per unit volume is given by this N in terms of parallax. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express
