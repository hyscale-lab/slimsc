Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

So the question is about a star with specific characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm, okay, so I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms between energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1 and n2) is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula should be something like n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So when there are spots, the overall effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when there are no spots (6000 K). 

Wait, but wait. The spots are dark, so they're cooler than the surrounding photosphere. But the question says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So when spots are present, the average temperature of the photosphere (as observed) is lower. So the entire photosphere is at a lower temperature when spots are present? Or is the temperature structure more complex?

Wait no, the problem says that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star’s average temperature is lower when spots are present. So the photosphere is considered to be at a lower temperature when spots are present.

But wait, actually, starspots are cooler regions on the surface, so the surrounding photosphere is at the higher temperature. But when calculating the effective temperature, it's the average based on the entire surface. So the star as a whole emits less because part of it is cooler. But the problem states that the photospheric effective temperature decreases, so I think in this context, the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K when spots are present. Or maybe each region (spot and non-spot) has its own temperature. Wait, no, the question says the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So perhaps the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. Or maybe the problem is considering each part of the photosphere as either spot or non-spot, but
