Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. But wait, how exactly does that translate into the planet's properties?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected shifts in their spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

I think the key here is to relate the Doppler shift to the orbital velocity of the star. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift. The formula I remember is K = (v sin i) for the star's velocity. But for circular orbits, the inclination i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1, so K is the velocity semi-amplitude.

Wait, I also recall that the RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) )

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun's mass, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies. Let me think, maybe another approach would be better.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

Wait, not sure. Another approach: the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital period and the mass of the planet.

Wait, another formula: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (P) * (1 + (M_planet/M_star)) )^(
