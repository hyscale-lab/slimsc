Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time is at least h-bar over 2. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around when considering the lifetime. Oh right, the uncertainty in energy ΔE multiplied by the uncertainty in time Δt is greater than or equal to ħ/2. But sometimes people use the approximation ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, especially for order-of-magnitude estimates.

So the question says two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Wait, wait. Wait, wait a second. Are these the lifetimes of the states themselves, or the uncertainty in time? Because the lifetimes of the states would correspond to the uncertainty in their measurements. Or perhaps, the lifetime of a state is the time for which the state exists before decaying, which would relate to the uncertainty in energy. Hmm.

I think the lifetime given here is the uncertainty in time Δt for each state. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be on the order of ħ over Δt. So for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1. Similarly, for Δt2 = 1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / Δt2.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states, E2 - E1. To distinguish the two levels, their energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't resolve them—they'd look like one broad peak instead of two.

Alternatively, maybe each state's energy uncertainty is the inverse of their own lifetime. So the idea is that the energy difference between the two should be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps each uncertainty. Or maybe, more accurately, the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Wait, but the uncertainty in energy for each state is determined by their own lifetime.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about each state's energy uncertainty. For E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (1e-9 s). For E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8 s). So the required condition for being able to resolve the two states is that the energy
