Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says a light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. They want to know the speed of the light relative to the observer. Oh, and they mentioned to take the speed of light in a vacuum c as 1. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in different media, the speed changes based on the refractive index. So normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, right? Because in a vacuum it's c, and when it's inside a medium with n, it's slower. So without any motion, the speed would be 1/n.

But here, the glass is moving. So this must be a problem involving reference frames and maybe some addition of velocities. Because the glass is moving, and the light is inside it, so perhaps we need to consider how the glass's motion affects the observed speed of the light.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. That's Einstein's postulate. But here, we're dealing with light inside a moving medium. So maybe it's a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps we can treat this as a problem where the medium (glass) is moving, and the light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So the light's speed relative to the lab would be the
