Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, let me think about what I remember.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I think this is in two dimensions because there are only dx² and dy² terms. So the metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as a multiple of the flat metric. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. And in two dimensions, the metric given might represent such a space.

Wait, the area... Normally, for a sphere of radius r, the area is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different. Oh wait, no, pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic space. But wait, in 2D, the pseudosphere (which is actually a tractricoid) has infinite area, right? Or am I mixing things up?

Wait, no. Wait, the metric given, let me analyze it. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So 4 is (2)^2. So if x² + y² is less than 4, the denominator is positive. If it's equal to 4, denominator is zero, which would be a singularity. So the space is defined where x² + y² <4. So the maximum radius is 2.

But wait, the metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), if I switch to polar coordinates. Because x² + y² = r², right? So in polar coordinates, the metric becomes [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the area element is the determinant of the metric's components. The metric in diagonal form is diag(32/(4-r²), 32 r²/(4 - r²)). So the determinant is (32/(4-r²)) * (32 r²/(4-r²)) )? Wait no, determinant for 2D metric is the product of the diagonal terms minus the off-diagonal (but in 2D, since it's diagonal, it's just product). So determinant is (32/(4
