Okay, so I need to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The product goes through several steps, and we need to determine the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

First, let me parse the initial reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH under heat, an elimination reaction occurs, typically forming an alkene. So this is probably an E2 reaction. The product would be an alkene, maybe 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps a different structure. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which suggests maybe a diene or a ring-strained structure. Alternatively, since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, the elimination would form a double bond in the bridge.

Wait, adamantane has a structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two adjacent bridges. When KOH is added, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond. So the product after KOH heating would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps 1,2-diene? Hmm, maybe not, because the starting material is 1,3-dibromo. So the elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3? Or maybe between 1 and another position. Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-diene, but I'm a bit confused about the structure.

But the NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a quartet (since it's written as 2H). Wait, no, the notation is 4.79(2H). Maybe it's a triplet or another splitting. Wait, the question says "4.79(2H), 2.41-2.23(10H), 1.94(2H)". So the 2H at 4.79 ppm suggests some protons that are more deshielded, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Oh, wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone
