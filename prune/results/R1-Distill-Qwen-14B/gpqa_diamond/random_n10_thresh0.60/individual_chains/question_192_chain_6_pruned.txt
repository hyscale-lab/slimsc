Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. The cavity has radius r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor. 

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that when you have a conductor, the charges reside on the surface. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, any internal charges will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Wait, but the conductor itself is neutral, so when you put a charge inside the cavity, it will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor, and the outer surface will have a charge equal to the original charge because the conductor was neutral. Wait no, wait. Let me get this straight.

The conductor is neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner surface has -q, the conductor's shell (the outer part) will have +q to balance it.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field at P would be due to the +q on the outer surface of the conductor. But wait, how is this charge distributed? Since it's a conductor, the outer charge will distribute itself uniformly on the outer surface. Because of that, the electric field outside would be the same as if the charge were concentrated at the center, right?

So the field at P should be like the field from a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. That would make the electric field E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center to point P.

Wait, but looking at the options
