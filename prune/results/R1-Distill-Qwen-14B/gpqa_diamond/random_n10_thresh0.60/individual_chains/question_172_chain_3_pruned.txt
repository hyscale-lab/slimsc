Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's try to work through this.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy levels in atoms depend on temperature. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. Oh wait, the Boltzmann factor tells us the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is familiar—it's close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, yeah! So the energy difference ΔE is k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So ΔE = k*T. Wait, but wait, in this question the energy difference is given, so maybe we can relate the temperatures of the two stars through that.

Wait, no. The problem is about the excitation levels. The excitation is the population of a higher energy level relative to a lower one. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights.

In this case, it's said that the iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1. So for star_1, the population of the higher energy level (n2) is twice that of the lower level (n1), assuming g2 and g1 are the same? Or wait, maybe the question is that for star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So n2/n1 for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, the wording says: the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps, the ratio (n_high/n_low) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for star_1, the excitation (n_high/n_low) is twice as much as in star_2.

Wait, but each star's own n_high/n_low ratio depends on their temperature. So for each star, we can write their ratio as:
