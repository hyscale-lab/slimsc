Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll do my best.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two given reactions. Let's break it down.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Hmm. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? It's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So what reaction do these undergo? Wait, I'm thinking about nucleophilic addition to ketones. Oh right, the cyanide ion (CN-) is a nucleophile. So in a ketone, the carbonyl group (C=O) can react with a nucleophile. 

In the product, I see a hydroxyl (OH) group and a nitrile (CN) group. Wait, but the starting material is a ketone. So perhaps it's a condensation reaction? Or maybe a specific addition.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structure. The main chain would be four carbons: the second carbon has both a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. So it's 

CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- to it, perhaps it's a substitution? Or more likely, an addition. But wait, in the product, the nitrile is attached
