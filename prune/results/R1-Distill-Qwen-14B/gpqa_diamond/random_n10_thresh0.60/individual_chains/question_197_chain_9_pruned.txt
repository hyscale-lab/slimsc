Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy and reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of a nitrile group. Or wait, maybe it's more about converting an alkyne to an amine? Hmm, no, wait. Another reaction I've heard about is the hydrolysis of a nitrile using HCl and H2O, but red phosphorus and HI... Oh! Oh right! I think that's the reaction where a nitrile (like RCN) is converted to an amine. Or wait, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an alkyne. Or perhaps it's the conversion of an alkyne into an amine via the Stephen reduction? No, wait, Stephen uses different reagents.

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's more about the hydrolysis of an acid chloride. But no, Compound X isn't necessarily an acid chloride. Alternatively, wait, maybe red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride to form a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, I might be mixing up things. Let me think again.

Red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to form amines. For example, when a nitrile is treated with H2O and red phosphorus, it produces an amine. Wait, but in this case, the reagent is HI. Hmm, maybe it's
