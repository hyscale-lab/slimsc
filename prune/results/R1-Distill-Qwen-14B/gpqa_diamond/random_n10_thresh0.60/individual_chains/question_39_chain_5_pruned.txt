Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles' positions, none were found where x is less than 1 or greater than 3. So all the particles are between x=1 and x=3. The question is to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm. Right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So I think I need to normalize the wave function so that the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 equals 1, because that's the total probability.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the complex part is imaginary. Let me think about how to find the modulus squared.

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, so real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x) )^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Wait, because the modulus of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²), so when squared, it's a² + b². So the probability density is |ψ|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

But wait, wait—no, wait. Because ψ is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) minus 0.5i. So ψ = A + i B, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and B is -0.5. So the modulus squared is A² + B². So yes, that's (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but I'm getting a little confused. Let me write it down properly.

ψ(x) = [ a / sqrt(1 + x) ] + ( -0.5 i )

So A = a/(sqrt(1+x)), B = -0.5. So |ψ|² = A² + B².

So,

|ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Now, the probability of finding the
