Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so they'll react in a neutralization reaction. 

So, the problem states that we've diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let me think about the initial solution after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration of acetic acid after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula, M1V1 = M2V2.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. Wait, no: 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with NaOH. The 25% titration point means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized, forming acetate ions.

Let me calculate the moles involved. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: Molarity is 0.025 M, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

When titrating, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid.

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added would be equal to moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The volume of NaOH needed for equivalence can be calculated. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so Volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

First, let's tackle the 25% titration point. 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol of NaOH has been added. Wait, wait, no: 25% of the acetic acid is neutralized, so the moles reacted are 0.00025 mol. So, the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the amount of acetate ion produced is 0.00025 mol.

The total volume at this point would be the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. But wait, how much NaOH is added at 25%? Since the equivalence point is 10 cm³, 25% would be 25% of that, which is 2.5 cm³. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³.

So now, we have a buffer solution of acetic acid and acetate ions. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
