Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of the area. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because the star is spotted, when it rotates, the brightness changes, which can look like an exoplanet transiting in front. The question is asking what the radius of an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Hmm, so I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots (which is due to the star's rotational modulation) to that caused by a planet transiting the star.

Wait, but the setup says the star isn't covered by spots, so the hypothetical exoplanet's signal would be the same as the spot's effect. Or wait, the problem states that the observed brightness variations are because of the spots, but if there were a planet instead, what size planet would cause the same change in brightness.

Wait no, the question says that when there are spots, the brightness variations are similar to having a planet. So to find the planet's radius that would produce the same signal as the spot-induced variations.

Wait, the way the question is phrased is: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star?"

So if the spots are causing a variation in brightness, and we want to find an exoplanet that would cause the same variation, we can calculate the planet's radius.

I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

Î”F = (Rp / R*)^2

But wait, that's only when the planet is in front of the star, blocking some light. The maximum dip is (Rp/R*)^2 because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots, and the brightness variation is due to spots rotating in and out of view. So the variation isn't just a simple dip, but a sinusoidal variation as the spots come into and out of view as the star rotates.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the star's brightness variation (due to spots) resembles that of an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness
