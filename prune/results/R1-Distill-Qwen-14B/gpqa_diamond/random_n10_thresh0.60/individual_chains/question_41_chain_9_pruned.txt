Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, special relativity comes into play, but wait, I'm not too sure about that. Maybe I should start by recalling some basics.

The problem says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is, what's the speed of light relative to the observer?

Wait, speed of light in glass when it's stationary is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So normally, v_light = c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so it's not just that simple.

I think this is a situation involving the medium moving relative to the observer. So I need to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but wait. Because the glass is moving, and the light is inside it. So the light's speed relative to the glass is c/n, but the glass itself is moving at velocity v.

So maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. I remember that in special relativity, if an object is moving at u in a frame S', which itself is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then
