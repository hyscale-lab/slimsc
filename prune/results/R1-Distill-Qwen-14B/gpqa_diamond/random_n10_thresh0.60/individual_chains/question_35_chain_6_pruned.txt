Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the setup. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I should write that out.

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay = c * S. So substituting c, Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Wait, eigenvalues and eigenvectors—right, that means I have to solve Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

So, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Wait, but let's write out Ay. Since Ay = c * S, and c = h/(4π), so Ay is:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                [i, 0]]

So the matrix looks like:

[[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
 [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

So the matrix elements are (h/(4π)) times the elements of S. So S is a Pauli matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices have similar forms, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

Wait, S here looks like the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so yes, S is σ_y. So Ay = c σ_y, with c = h/(4π).

The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix, like σ_y, are ±1. Because for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So if Ay is c times σ_y, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * (±1), so ±c.

So substituting c: a = (h/(4π)) * (±1) → a = ±h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. The Pauli matrices have
