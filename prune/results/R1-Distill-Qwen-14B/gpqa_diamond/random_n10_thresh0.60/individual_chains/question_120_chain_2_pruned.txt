Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means their density is the same no matter where you look. Wait, no, it's about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer the star, the larger the parallax.

Parallax, plx, is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So we're looking for how many stars there are in a given range of parallax values. Let's think about this.

If stars are uniformly distributed, their spatial density is uniform. So the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But since parallax relates to distance, we can model this in terms of distance.

Wait, parallax (p) is 1/d, so d = 1/p. So when p increases, d decreases, meaning stars are closer. So the number of stars per unit parallax would depend on the range of p and how that relates to the volume.

Let me think about the volume. The volume of a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr would be 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a shell is surface area times thickness. Surface area is 4πd².

But when we're considering stars in a range of parallax from p to p + dp (a small change), we can express this in terms of distance. Since p = 1/d, dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dp. But since dp is a small positive change when p increases, maybe I should take absolute values. So, dr = d² dp.

Wait, because if p increases, d decreases. So for a shell with thickness dp in parallax, the corresponding thickness in distance is dr = d² dp. Because dp = - (1/(d²)) dd → dd = -d² dp. So the absolute value is |dd|= d² dp.

So the volume at distance d is 4πd² dr. Substitute dr with d² dp. So volume becomes 4πd² * (d² dp) = 4π d^4 dp.

But wait, d = 1/p, so substituting that in, d^4 becomes (1/p)^4. So the volume in terms of p is 4π (1/p)^4 dp.

Since the number of stars is proportional to the volume, the number of stars in a shell with parallax p and thickness dp is proportional to (1/p^4) dp. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, which is the number per dp. So that would be proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait—no. Wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)". So per unit plx, which is per dp. So, I think the number of stars per unit plx is N = (4π d² dr) / (dp). Because for each dp, you get a certain number of stars.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the number of stars in a thin shell between plx p and p + dp. The number of stars, N
