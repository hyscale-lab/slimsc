Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, we have 10,000 identical systems. Each has a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Hmm, wait. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus (the absolute value squared) gives the probability density of finding the particle at a position. So the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1, because the total probability is 100%.

But wait, in this case, the wave function isn't zero outside x=1 to x=3. Or wait, no: the measurements found particles only between x=1 and x=3. So that implies that the wave function should be zero outside this interval. Because if the wave function is non-zero elsewhere, there's some probability of finding the particle there, but in the measurements, that didn't happen. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the way the question is phrased, the given wave function is for the part where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So I think the wave function is zero outside that region, but the given expression is for the part between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the wave function is a complex function.

Wait, but for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|^2 from x=1 to x=3 should be 1. Because the particle is only found in that region, the wave function is non-zero only there.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i, for 1 ≤ x ≤3, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but normally, the wave functions are such that their integral from -infinity to infinity is 1. But in this case,
