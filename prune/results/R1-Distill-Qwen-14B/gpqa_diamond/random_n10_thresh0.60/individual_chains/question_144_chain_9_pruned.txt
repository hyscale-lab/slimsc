Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't exist long enough to be observed directly and quickly decays into other particles.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are A through D, all in terms of meters with exponents of 10^-15 or 10^-16.

Wait, how do I approach this? I think the mean decay distance depends on how long the particle lives on average and how fast it's moving. Oh right, the decay length is the product of the lifetime and the velocity times the speed of light.

So, first, I need to find the lifetime of the meson X. I remember that the width Γ (the decay width) is related to the lifetime τ via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I have to make sure about the units here.

Calculating the lifetime: Γ is given in MeV. I know that ħ in units of MeV·s is approximately 6.582×10^-25 MeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So, Γ is 320 MeV, so let me compute τ.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) = 6.582e-25 / 320 s. Let me calculate that: 6.582 / 320 is about 0.02056875. So 0.02056875e-25 seconds. Which is 2.056875e-27 seconds. Wait, that seems really tiny, but meson lifetimes are usually short.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since it's produced with energy E_X=8 GeV and mass m_X=1.2 GeV, I can use the energy-momentum relation to find the momentum and then the velocity.

The total energy E is related to the rest mass by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let's solve for p.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Let me compute E² and (m c^2)^2. Wait, units: since we're working in natural units where c=1, E and m are in GeV, and p would be in GeV/c. But when calculating the velocity, I need to be careful.

Wait, in natural units, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, E in GeV, m in GeV/c². Wait, maybe it's easier to compute beta and gamma.

Beta is v/c, and gamma is E/(m c²). So gamma = E / (m c^2). But since E and m are in GeV, and c is considered as 1 in these units, E/(m c^2) is (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Beta can be found using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2). So 6.6667 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2). Let me square both sides: (6.6667)^2 = 1/(1 - beta^2). 6.6667 squared is about 44.4444. So 44.4444 = 1/(1-beta^2) → 1 - beta^2 = 1/44.4444 ≈ 0.0225. So beta^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0225 = 0.
