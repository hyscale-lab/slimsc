Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³. But wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? So I think the initial concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So the moles of acetic acid initially would be 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles. To reach equivalence, the moles of NaOH needed would be the same, 0.001 moles. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't asking for the volume, but the pH at equivalence.

At equivalence, the solution would be the sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

The concentration of acetate would be the moles of acetate divided by the total solution volume. Let me calculate that. The moles of acetate are 0.001 moles (same as acetic acid initially). The total volume after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution is 50 cm³
