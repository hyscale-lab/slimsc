Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The states |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not necessarily a unit vector.

The next part is about measuring the probability in the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds like an anti-diagonal matrix. Because in a 2x2 matrix, the elements where i≠j would be the off-diagonal elements. So maybe this operator is something like sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2?

Wait, sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which has 0s on the diagonal and 1s on the off-diagonals. Its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x, right? So if the operator in question is (hbar/2) sigma_x, then its eigenstates would be the same as sigma_x's, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

But wait, the question is asking about measuring the eigenstates of the operator with matrix A. So I think we need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. Wait, but A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it down.

A is a 2x2 matrix where A12 = A21 = hbar/2, and A11 = A22 = 0. So the matrix is:
[ 0        hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0     ]

Wait, that's correct because when i≠j, Aij is hbar/2. So the matrix is:

0      hbar/2
hbar/2 0

So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ² - (
