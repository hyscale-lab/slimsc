Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They assume the stars radiate as black bodies and computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. The options are A to D.

Wait, the part about radial velocities... Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. So Star_1 is not moving, and Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. But how does that affect their luminosities?

Hmm, the problem says they're using black body radiation, so I should think about the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The luminosity L of a star is given by L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. Oh wait, 4π comes from the surface area of the sphere, right. So σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the key things here are the radius and the temperature of each star. Since both stars appear to have their maximum brightness at the same wavelength, that might relate to their temperatures. Because in black body radiation, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature, right? The Wien's displacement law: λ_max * T = constant (approx 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if both have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no, the problem says the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest are the same. So λ1_max = λ2_max, so T1 must equal T2? Because if λ_max is the same, then T is same, since λ_max is proportional to 1/T.

Wait, but that's assuming they are black bodies. So yes, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, but Star_2 has a higher radial velocity. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh wait, the problem says that the
