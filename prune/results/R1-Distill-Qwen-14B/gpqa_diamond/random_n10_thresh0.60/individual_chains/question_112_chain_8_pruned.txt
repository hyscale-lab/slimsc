Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question involves finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and then calculating the average value of an operator. 

Alright, let's break down the problem. The state of the electron is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2竏段)|down>. Oh wait, so first I need to normalize this state, right? Because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, but only if the state is normalized.

Wait, the state is proportional, so I think that means it's not normalized yet. So I need to find the normalization factor. Let me write down the state:

|alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2竏段)|down>, where a is the proportionality constant. Wait, no, wait. The question says it's proportional to that expression, so I think the actual state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2竏段)|down>, multiplied by some normalization constant.

So first step: find the normalization constant. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. Let me compute <alpha|alpha>.

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2竏段)|down>. So the bra vector <alpha| is (1-i) <up| + (2+i) <down|.

Calculating <alpha|alpha>:

(1 - i)(1 + i) + (2 + i)(2 - i)
