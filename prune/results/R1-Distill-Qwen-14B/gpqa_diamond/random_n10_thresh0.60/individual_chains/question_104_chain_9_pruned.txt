Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. So, I remember that the RV method detects planets by looking for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little back and forth as the planet orbits it.

There are two stars, each with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune, which I think is less than Jupiter but more than Earth. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The key data here are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, so I need to find the ratio of their orbital periods, P2/P1. 

Wait, how does the RV method relate the velocity of the star to the planet's orbit? I remember that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, often denoted as K. The semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. 

The formula I recall for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v * (M_planet) ) / (M_star) ) ... wait, no, maybe it's more precise to think in terms of the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3)) ) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should think about the simplified version when M_planet << M_star. Since Neptune is much less massive than the star (Sun-like), M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So, M_planet + M_star ≈ M_star. So, the formula may simplify.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula is:

K = ( (27 * π * G )^ (1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since e is zero (they have circular orbits), that simplifies to:

K = ( (27 * π * G )^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But wait, sin i is 1 because the orbits are edge-on (since we detected the planet via RV, which requires that the orbit is edge-on enough for the Doppler shift to be significant). So, sin i = 1.

Given that both stars have the same mass (M1 = M2 = M_sun), and both planets have the same mass (m1 = m2 = Neptune mass), let's denote them as M and m respectively.

So, K is proportional to (m / (M^(2/3) * P^(1/3))) ) multiplied by some constants.

Wait, but since both stars are the same, and both planets have the same mass, the only varying parameters are the periods. Let me rearrange the formula.

We can write K ∝ (m) / (M^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

But since M and m are the same for both stars and planets, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3).

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's write the formula for K more accurately. 

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G P)^(1/3) * m sin i ) / ( (2π)^(1/3) (M_star)^(2/3)
