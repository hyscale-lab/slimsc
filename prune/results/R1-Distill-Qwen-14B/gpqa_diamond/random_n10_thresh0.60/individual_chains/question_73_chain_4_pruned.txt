Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Oh right, the options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if one object is moving at 0.6c and another at 0.5c, their relative speed isn't simply 0.1c. I think you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me write that down.

So, for the relative speed, let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. Wait, but wait—relative speed can be tricky. Which one am I taking as the reference? Oh, right, the relative speed is how fast one sees the other moving. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²). Wait, no, wait. Let's get this straight. The formula is (v - u)/(1 - vu/c²), where v is the velocity of the first object as observed in the second's frame, or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the standard formula is when you have two velocities, u and u', and you want to find the velocity of one frame relative to another. Oh wait, the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u' v)/c²), where u' is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame. Hmm, so in this case, if I'm in the frame of astronaut A, who is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame, then the velocity of B as seen by A would be (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) ) ?

Wait
