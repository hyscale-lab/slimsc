Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y for a muon.

Alright, let's start by understanding the given information. The operator A_y is defined as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). The matrix S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So, S looks like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And A_y = c * S, so substituting c, A_y becomes (h/(4π)) * S. Let me write that out:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                 [i, 0]]

So, A_y is a 2x2 matrix. The task is to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then determine which of the given options is correct.

I remember that to find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0. Let's compute that.

First, let me write A_y - λI:

A_y - λI = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
                      [i, 0]] - λ * [[1, 0],
                                    [0, 1]]

Which becomes:

[[ -λ, (h/(4π))*(-i) ],
 [ (h/(4π))*i, -λ ] ]

So the determinant is:

|A_y - λI| = [(-λ)(-λ) ) ] - [ (h/(4π))*(-i) * (h/(4π))*i ) ]

The first term is λ². The second term is (h/(4π))² * (-i)(i). Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²), and since i² is -1, this becomes (h/(4π))² * (i²) → (-1). Wait, let me compute that correctly.

Wait, (-i) * (i) = (-i^2) = - (-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so (-i)(i) is -i²= -(-1)=1.

So the determinant equation is:

λ² - [ (h/(4π))² * 1 ] = 0

So λ² = (h/(4π))² → λ = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but wait a second. Because the matrix S is part of the Pauli matrices, right? S is the Pauli Y matrix. Oh wait, no, actually the Pauli Y matrix is usually written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix
