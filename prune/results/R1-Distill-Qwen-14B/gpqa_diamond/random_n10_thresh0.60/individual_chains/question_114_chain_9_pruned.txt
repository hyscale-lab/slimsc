Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form a carboxylic acid, specifically 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and reagent A. I remember that ketones can undergo various nucleophilic additions. But when NaCN is present, I think it's a nucleophilic substitution maybe. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when you add something like NaCN, which is a cyanide source, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition followed by elimination or something else.

Wait, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If NaCN adds, where would the CN go? Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution. Wait, but ketones don't typically undergo SN2 reactions because the carbonyl is not a good leaving group. So perhaps it's an addition-elimination mechanism. Oh right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it can form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is an addition product where the CN adds to the carbonyl, and the OH adds to the adjacent carbon. So the product would have both groups on the same carbon.

So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would result in (CH3)2C(OH)CN. That's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, right? So the reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. Now, under what conditions does this happen? I think the cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile, but maybe it requires an acid catalyst. Because in the formation of cyanohydrins, sometimes an acid like H3O+ is used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile.

So reagent A is probably H
