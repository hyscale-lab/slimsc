Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which reagents A and B are needed for the given reactions. Let me think through this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's typically a nucleophilic substitution or some kind of addition. Wait, but wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. Oh, right! It's about the formation of nitriles from ketones, maybe through a substitution.

Wait, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with a cyanide source, like NaCN, under certain conditions, it can form a nitrile. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, that's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, the structure I think is (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2-CN? Or is the nitrile on the same carbon as the hydroxyl?

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the butanenitrile part is four carbons with a nitrile group. The 2 position has both a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? No, wait,
