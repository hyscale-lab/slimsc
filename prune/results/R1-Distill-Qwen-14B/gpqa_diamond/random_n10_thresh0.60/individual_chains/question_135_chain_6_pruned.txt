Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is provided, which is L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Let me break it down.

So, the Lagrangian looks like it's describing an interaction between the boson field X and some fermion fields. The term λf f(y) must be the coupling constant multiplied by the fermion fields. The ψ_f(y) is probably the fermion field. So the interaction term is something like λ times the fermion fields multiplied by (v + X), which suggests that X is interacting with these fermions.

Now, the question is about the possible decays of X at the lowest order. At lowest order, I think that means tree-level decays, so the simplest possible processes where X decays into two particles. The possible decay products depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions it can decay into.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, any decay product needs to have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, wait! Because when a particle decays, each product's rest mass must be less than the mass of X. So for a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion must have mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m < M_X. Because if each is m, their combined rest mass would be 2m, which needs to be less than or equal to 6 GeV, so m ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but let's think about the possible fermions. The known fermions include quarks and leptons. So let's list them with their masses:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): mass ≈ 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ≈ 0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): ≈ 1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~2 MeV (0.002 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Wait, but the top quark is way too heavy. Its mass is about 173 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into top quarks. So the possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

Wait, but the bottom quark is about 4 GeV. So 2m_b would be about 8
