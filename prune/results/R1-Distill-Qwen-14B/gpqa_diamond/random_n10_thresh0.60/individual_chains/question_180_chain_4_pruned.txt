Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of a system with charges. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Oh wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So the 12 are all located 2 meters away from P, and the 13th is at P. 

Wait, so the system's energy... I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since the charges are identical and placed symmetrically, maybe there's a simpler way to calculate this.

Each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge is. So the potential energy between each of these 12 charges and the charge at P must be considered. Also, the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves because they are all at the same distance from each other? Or wait, no. If they're all at the same distance from P, but where exactly? Are they arranged in a sphere around P? I think so. So the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be the same as each being on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m. Wait, but if you have 12 charges equally spaced on a sphere, then each is at a distance from the others. Hmm, calculating that might get complicated
