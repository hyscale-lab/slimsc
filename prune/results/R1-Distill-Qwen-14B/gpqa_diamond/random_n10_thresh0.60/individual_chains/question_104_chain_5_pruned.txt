Okay, so I need to figure out how much longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Both planets have similar masses to Neptune and their host stars are similar to the Sun. The RV method is being used to detect them.

Hmm, the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift is periodic, and its amplitude depends on the planet's mass and orbital characteristics.

Wait, the problem says that planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. So the shift is larger for planet #2's star. I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter.

Oh right, the formula for the RV method is something like the semi-amplitude K equals ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(c * (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3))) ) * ( (1) / (sin i) ) ) but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) ), but perhaps I should think about the scaling relation between the velocity shifts and the orbital periods.

Wait, more accurately, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K as:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_*)^(2/3) ) )

But maybe for this problem, since both stars have the same mass (M_*), and the planets have similar masses (so M_p is the same for both), and assuming that the inclination i is similar (maybe they're edge-on, same sin i), then K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), because all other factors are the same. Or wait, looking again, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), so K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Wait, if K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P, then P is proportional to (1/K^3). So if planet #2's K is larger than planet #1's, then planet #2's period is smaller than planet #1's?

Wait no, let me think again. Let's model it more accurately.
