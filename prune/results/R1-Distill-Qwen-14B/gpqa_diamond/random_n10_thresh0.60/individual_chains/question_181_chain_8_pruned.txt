Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, let me try to think through this.

First, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping in the Sun's core. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves a few steps. The proton-proton chain is the main one, right? And I think the pp-III branch is a specific part of that process.

Wait, the pp chain has a few branches. The main one is pp-I, which produces helium-4. Then there's pp-II, maybe involving boron or something. Oh right, I think pp-III is another branch where maybe two protons fuse with a helium-3 nucleus. So, if pp-III stops, what does that mean for neutrino production?

Solar neutrinos are produced mainly during the fusion processes. The dominant source is the pp chain, especially the proton-proton reactions. Neutrinos are a byproduct, like in the case of the beta decay steps. So, if part of the pp chain stops, the neutrino flux should change accordingly.

The question says the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. That's roughly the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, the Earth would detect the change in neutrino flux after that time delay. But since the question is about the ratio now, the flux has changed.

The options are asking about the ratio of fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and
