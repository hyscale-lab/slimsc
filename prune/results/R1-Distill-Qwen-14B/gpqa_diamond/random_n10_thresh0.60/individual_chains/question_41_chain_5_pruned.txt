Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and glass moving. Hmm, let me think through it. So the question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. First, I remember that the speed of light in a medium isn't just c/n, but that's the speed relative to the medium itself. But here, the medium (the glass) is moving, so I have to consider relative velocities.

So the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, towards the observer. Wait, no: the glass is moving toward the observer, and the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass (and hence the medium) is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, but light in a medium... Let me think. Normally, when a medium is moving, the speed of light as observed in the lab frame would depend on the medium's motion. But wait, in special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the observer's motion. But this question is about the speed in a medium, so maybe it's different
