Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension, and they're organized based on the symmetries they respect.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Well, SMEFT is built on top of the SM, right? And the SM respects Lorentz symmetry. So any operator in SMEFT should also respect that because they're supposed to be consistent with the SM's framework. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, forming the Poincare group. But in effective theories, especially when considering higher-dimensional operators, I think they usually don't respect all of Poincare because those operators can have explicit momentum dependence. Oh wait, no. The SMEFT operators are organized in such a way that they are renormalizable-like, so maybe they do respect Poincare? Or not? Or does Poincare symmetry not have to be respected because the operators are built from the SM fields, which do transform under Poincare. Wait, but the effective operators might have higher derivatives, but I'm a bit confused here. I think that the SME
