Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... I remember that when alkenes react with HI, it's typically an addition reaction, maybe a halogenation. Oh wait, but red phosphorus is used in the hydroxylation of alkenes to form diols, but wait no, that's with other reagents. Or wait, another thought: red phosphorus is used in the reaction to convert alkenes into diols via the hydroxylation, but that's with H2O2 and H2SO4 maybe. Or wait, waitâ€”no, red phosphorus and HI is used in the formation of iodoalcohols? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation or some kind of substitution?

Wait, no. Oh wait, another thought: Maybe this is about the hydrolysis of an alkyne. Because red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of alkynes. If you have an alkyne and treat it with a strong acid like HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze. But wait, how does that work? I think the alkyne would react with water, but in acidic conditions. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's with ketones and peracids.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Red phosphorus is often used in the hydroxymercuration of alkenes, but that's with mercury. Or wait, maybe the problem is
