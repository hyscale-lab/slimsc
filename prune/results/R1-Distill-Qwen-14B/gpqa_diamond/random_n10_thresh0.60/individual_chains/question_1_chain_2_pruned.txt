Alright, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. So the question is about two energy levels and their distinguishability. Let me read it again.

Okay, the problem says two quantum states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find which energy difference allows us to clearly resolve these two levels.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle plays a role here. Oh right, the energy-time uncertainty principle. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time should be on the order of ħ.

Wait, but what's Δt here? Oh, the lifetime τ is the time uncertainty Δt. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ). 

So for E1 with τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 * 1e-9). Similarly, for E2 with τ2 = 1e-8, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 * 1e-8). 

Wait, but since ħ is about 6.582e-16 eV·s, let me plug that in. Let me compute ΔE1 first.

ΔE1 = ħ / (2 * τ1) ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (6.582e-16)/(2e-9) = 3.291e-7 eV. 

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * τ2) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-8) = 6.582e-16 / 2e-8 = 3.291e-8 eV.

But wait, I think I might be mixing up the uncertainties. Because the lifetime is τ, which is Δt, so the broader the lifetime, the smaller the energy uncertainty. Because if an object exists longer (bigger Δt), you can measure its energy more precisely, so smaller ΔE.

So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 has to be much larger than the sum of their energy uncertainties for them to be distinguishable. Because if the energy difference is too small compared to the uncertainties, you can't resolve them as separate peaks or
