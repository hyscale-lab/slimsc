Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in meters, so it's about calculating the average distance the particle travels before decaying.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (or proper mean lifetime) is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the formula involves the particle's lifetime, which is connected to its width via the uncertainty principle. But wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is related by τ = ħ / Γ. Since ħ is Planck's constant over 2π, but I think the formula might just be τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, particles that are moving have a certain lifetime, and the mean decay length is velocity times lifetime times the speed. Oh wait, the mean decay distance L is c * τ * β, where β is the velocity over c. Or wait, maybe it's just βγ c τ, but for non-relativistic particles, γ is 1, but that's probably not the case here. Wait, but X is a meson, which is a boson, but I don't know its specific velocity. So I need to find the velocity of the particle.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the velocity from its energy and mass. Since E is given as 8 GeV, which is much higher than the rest mass of 1.2
