Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. So, the setup is a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. And the speed of light is c.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy at maximum velocity would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't just use classical mechanics here. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

So in relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential in the same way. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy (mc²) and kinetic energy (K). But wait, actually, for a relativistic oscillator, when the mass is at the maximum amplitude, all the energy would be potential, right? Or maybe not, because in relativity, energy isn't conserved in the same way because of the rest mass energy.

Wait, no. The total energy includes the rest mass energy and the potential energy. Because in the case of a classical oscillator,
