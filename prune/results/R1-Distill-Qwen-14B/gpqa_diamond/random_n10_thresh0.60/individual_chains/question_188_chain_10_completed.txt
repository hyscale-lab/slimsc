Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for a specific plane. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my solid state chemistry class.

Alright, the question says the crystal is rhombohedral. I think rhombohedral means all the edges are the same length, and all the angles are equal. Oh wait, the problem gives the angles as 30 degrees each, so alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, I'm trying to remember—interatomic distance, does that mean the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms? Because in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are length 'a', right?

So the question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by the Bragg's law formula, but wait, no, Bragg's law is for diffraction. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ) )^(1/2) divided by something? Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the correct formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system with all angles and edges equal (rhombohedral) is d_hkl = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the edges. Or wait, maybe it's a different formula. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + ... some cross terms ) )^(-1/2). No, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Or perhaps another way: for a cubic system, the formula is straightforward, but rhombohedral is more complex.

Wait, I found a formula before. The interplanar spacing for a rhombohedral system is given by d_{hkl} = ( a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) )^(-1/2), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ). Or wait, perhaps it's d = a / [ sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) ] where θ is the angle. But wait, in rhombohedral systems, the angles are all the same, so alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees in this case.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = ( (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )) ) )^(-1/2) / (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, I might have a better approach. Since all the angles are the same (30 degrees), perhaps the formula simplifies.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula is d = ( a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) ), but I'm not confident.

Wait, wait. Let me look up the formula for a rhombohedral lattice. Oh wait, since I can't look things up, I'll have to recall. I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which in this case is 30 degrees.

So yeah, that's the formula I think. Let me write that down.

So, given that the Miller indices are (111), then h=1, k=1, l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1*1 + 1*1 +1*1) * cos(30°) )

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute the sum of squares: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then the cross terms: 2*(1 + 1 + 1) = 2*(3) =6.

Multiply that by cos(30°). Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

Now sum that to the previous sum: 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So the denominator is sqrt(8.196).

Compute sqrt(8.196). Let me see, sqrt(9)=3, sqrt(8.196) is a bit less than 3, perhaps around 2.863?

Wait, 2.863 squared is about 8.196. Let me compute 2.863^2: 2.863 * 2.863. Let's see, 2.8^2 is 7.84. 0.063^2 is about 0.0039, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, 2.86 * 2.86: 2 * 2 =4, 2 * 0.86 = 1.72, 0.86 * 2=1.72, 0.86 * 0.86≈0.7396. So 2.86^2 is approximately (2 + 0.86)^2 = 4 + 2*2*0.86 + 0.86^2 = 4 + 3.44 + 0.7396 = 8.1796. Close enough to 8.196. So sqrt(8.196) is approximately 2.863.

So the denominator is 2.863.

Then, a is 10 Angstroms.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493? Wait, that can't be right because the options are all around 9 Angstrom.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. 10 divided by 2.863 is about 3.49, but the options are 8.95, etc. Did I mess up the formula?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the denominator is sqrt( sum ), so 10 divided by about 2.86 is around 3.49, but that would be way too small. But the options are in 9's. Hmm, so I must have gotten the formula wrong.

Wait, maybe I forgot some part of the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is actually:

d = ( a^2 ) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) )

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, no, that's what I did before. But that leads to a value of about 3.49, which doesn't match the options. So perhaps I have the formula wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula is:

d = [ (a²) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, but that would be different. Let me try that.

So with a=10, angles 30 degrees, and (111) plane.

So compute the denominator: 3 - 2*(3)*cos(30°).

Wait, cos(30) is about 0.8660.

So denominator is 3 - 2*3*0.866 = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196. Wait, that can't be right, because you can't have a negative inside the square root. So that can't be the correct formula.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal, regardless of system.

The general formula is:

d = ( 1/√( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) ) ) * (1/a )

Wait, no, wait: I think it's actually:

d = ( 1 / √( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α ) - 2(hl cos β ) - 2(kl cos γ )) ) ) * ( a / (h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ) )

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so cos α etc. are zero, and it becomes d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), which is correct.

But in this case, the angles are 30 degrees, and alpha=beta=gamma=30.

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So plugging into that formula:

denominator = sqrt( 3 - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

= sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * (√3/2)) )

Wait, cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 3 * 0.866 ≈ 2.598.

Multiply by 2: 2 * 2.598 ≈5.196.

So denominator = sqrt(3 -5.196) = sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That can't be right. So that formula must be wrong.

Wait, so I must be mixing up the formula. Let me think differently.

Another approach: the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

The reciprocal lattice vector components are given by:

h^* = (h/a) / ( sin( terms ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the metric tensor. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral system is given by:

G = [ [ a², a² cos α, a² cos β ],
      [a² cos α, a², a² cos γ ],
      [a² cos β, a² cos γ, a² ] ]

Since all angles are 30 degrees, G becomes:

G = [ [ a², a² cos30, a² cos30 ],
      [a² cos30, a², a² cos30 ],
      [a² cos30, a² cos30, a² ] ]

Then, the reciprocal lattice vectors are defined such that the matrix product G * G^* = I, where G^* is the reciprocal metric tensor.

The reciprocal metric tensor for hkl is:

G^* = (1/d^2) * [ [ l^2 + m^2, n^2 - p^2, nq - pm ],
                 ... ] Wait, maybe I'm getting into too much detail here.

Alternatively, the formula for d in terms of the metric tensor is:

d² = ( a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a² (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ) )^{-1} )

Wait, that's another formula I've heard before.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The interplanar distance is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) * (1/a )

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But for (111), with all angles 30 degrees:

Compute the denominator:

Denominator = sqrt( 3 - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 2*(3 * (√3/2)) )

= sqrt(3 - 3√3 )

Wait, 3√3 is about 5.196, so 3 -5.196 = -2.196. So sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. So that can't be the correct formula.

Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

In that case, for (111), the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * cos30) )

So 3 + 2*(3 * (√3/2 )) = 3 + 3√3 ≈3 + 5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

So d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms. But none of the options are near 3.49. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but the options are all around 9 Angstrom. So maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Another idea: perhaps the interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter 'a', but maybe I'm confusing 'a' with something else.

Wait, the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be equal to 'a', but in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps 'a' is the edge length of the unit cell, which is different from the interatomic distance.

Wait, no, I think interatomic distance refers to the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice, which is 'a' in a cubic structure. But in a rhombohedral structure, the actual interatomic distance might be a function of the angles.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which in a crystal is determined by the lattice parameter and the structure. For example, in a simple cubic structure, the distance is 'a', but in a face-centered cubic, it's a√2/2= a/√2.

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance would be same as the lattice parameter 'a' because each atom is at the corners of the rhombohedral unit cell. So perhaps the interatomic distance (nearest neighbor distance) is indeed 'a'.

Wait, but that can't be, because in a rhombohedral lattice, the atoms are at the corners, but the distance between nearest atoms is 'a' only if it's a simple cubic. But in a rhombohedral structure, the geometry is more complex. So perhaps the interatomic distance is not equal to 'a', but calculated from the unit cell parameters.

Wait, maybe I should think about the unit cell. In a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corner, and the nearest neighbors are along the edges. So the interatomic distance would actually be 'a', same as a simple cubic. Because in a simple cubic, each atom is at the corners, and the nearest neighbor is along the edge at a distance 'a'. So perhaps in this case, 'a' is 10 Angstroms.

So going back to the formula, I'm probably using the wrong formula for interplanar distance.

Wait, maybe another approach. The interplanar distance for a (hkl) plane in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

where θ is the angle between the edges. Since all angles are 30 degrees, and θ is 30.

So plugging in h=k=l=1:

d = 10 / sqrt( 3 + 2*(3) * cos30 )

So 3 + 6 * (√3/2) = 3 + 3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= about 2.863.

So d=10/2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options are in 8-10 Angstrom. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I flipped the formula. Maybe it's a over ( sqrt( sum ) ), but I can't get the answer to match any of the options when I use this approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angles are 30 degrees, but in the formula the angles used are the angles in the reciprocal space, not the real space. Or perhaps I'm using the angles incorrectly.

Wait, no, the angles in the formula are the angles in the real space lattice. Because in the metric tensor, the cosines are of the angles between the real space vectors.

Wait, another possible mistake: maybe the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal vectors, but I think that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice is:

d = a / ( sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) )

But then for (111), it would be 3 - 2*(3)*cos30.

Which is 3 - 6*(0.866) ≈3 -5.196= -2.196. So sqrt of negative, which is impossible. So that can't be the correct formula.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a negative sign somewhere. Another thought: maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2*(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But in this case, that would give 3 - 2*(3 * 0.866) = 3 -5.196= -2.196. sqrt is impossible. So that formula must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Miller indices and what plane (111) represents. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Another idea: Perhaps I've mixed up the formula for interplanar distance and the formula for the length in reciprocal space.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait, that's what I did earlier, which gives me around 3.49 Angstroms. But the options are way higher. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance formula is given by 1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) + ... some terms involving the angles.

Wait, for a general triclinic system, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )/(a²)

So 1/d² = [ h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α ] / a²

So d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2hk cos γ + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos α )

Wait, in our case, since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, and (hkl)=(111), so:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*(1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30 + 1*1*cos30) )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 3*2*(cos30) )

Wait, because 2*(hk cos gamma) becomes 2*(1*1 * cos30) for each term. Since all angles are 30, that's 3 terms.

Wait, no, let me re-calculate:

The denominator is 3 + 2*( (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) + (1*1 cos30) )

=3 + 2*(3 * cos30 )

So 3 + 6 * (√3/2 )= 3 + 3√3 ≈3 +5.196=8.196

sqrt(8.196)=2.863

d=10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstroms.

But the options don't have anything near 3.49. So something's wrong here.

Wait, the options are all around 9 Angstrom, which is bigger than the lattice parameter. That doesn't make sense because interplanar distances are generally smaller than the lattice parameter, but wait, wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, in a cubic system, the (100) plane has d=a, which is same as lattice parameter. Hmm, but the options are higher than 10, which is the lattice parameter. Wait, no, the options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos θ ) )

But as I saw before, that gives negative number in denominator. So no.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos θ )

But that brings the same issue.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the formula with something else. Let me think about the possible alternative.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos θ )

But with θ being 180-30=150 degrees? Because sometimes the angle between vectors is the supplementary angle.

Wait, wait, maybe the angles in the formula are the angles between the vectors, which for a rhombohedral system, the angle between any two vectors is 30 degrees, but perhaps in the formula, the angle used is the angle between the reciprocal vectors. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the angle between the lattice vectors as 30 degrees, but in the formula, the angle is 180-30=150 degrees because that's the obtuse angle between them. So cos(150)= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

If that's the case, then for the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but cos α would be cos(150)= -0.866.

So plugging in:

denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * (-0.866) )

= sqrt(3 + 2*(-2.598) )

= sqrt( 3 -5.196 )= sqrt(-2.196). Again, imaginary. So that can't be.

Wait, this is getting frustrating. I must have the formula wrong. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = ( a ) / ( sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2 hk (1 + cos α) + 2 hl (1 + cos β) + 2 kl (1 + cos γ) ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos α) )

Hmm, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of a rhombohedral system as a special case of a hexagonal system. Wait, no, hexagonal has different symmetry.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should compute the volume of the unit cell first. The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would help me find d.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors. The vectors are a, a, a, each with an angle of 30 degrees between them.

The (111) plane is defined by the plane whose intercepts are (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes along the direction perpendicular to the plane.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral lattice is given by:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) )

where θ is the angle between the vectors.

So with θ=30 degrees, the denominator becomes sqrt(3 + 6 * (sqrt(3)/2 )) = sqrt(3 + 3*sqrt(3)).

Compute sqrt(3 + 3*1.732) = sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196)= ~2.863.

So d=10 /2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

But again, none of the options match. So perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me think: in a simple cubic, d = a / sqrt(h^2 +k^2 + l^2). So for (111), d = a / sqrt(3) ≈ 10 /1.732≈5.77 Angstroms. But the options are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the inverse. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos θ) )) )

Wait, that might be a possibility. Let's compute that.

(h +k + l)^2 = (3)^2=9.

2(hk + hl + kl)(1 - cos θ) = 2*(3)*(1 - cos30) =6*(1 -0.866)=6*0.134≈0.804.

So denominator inside sqrt is 9 -0.804=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms. No, same result.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere, but I can't see where.

Wait, all the options are around 9 Angstrom. If my calculation is 3.49, and the options are 9.08, etc., which is approximately 3 times larger.

Hmm, could it be that I was supposed to use cos(150 degrees) instead of cos30? Because cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

Let me try that.

So denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * (-sqrt(3)/2 )) )

= sqrt(3 + 2*(-2.598) )

= sqrt(3 -5.196)= sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that can't be.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos(180-θ) )

Which would be 3 - 2*3*cos(150). Cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2.

So 3 - 2*3*(-0.866) = 3 +5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms.

Same as before. So that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the angle. If the angle is 30 degrees, but in the formula I should use 60, or 180-30=150 degrees. I've already tried that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the unit vectors. Let's model the rhombohedral lattice with vectors a, b, c, each of length 'a', with angles of 30 degrees between each other.

The (111) plane has normal vector (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes, which can be found by the reciprocal of the projection of the unit vectors onto the normal direction.

Hmm, perhaps using vector approach.

The interplanar distance is given by:

d = (a) / ( |n| * sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 + ... ) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the vector normal to the (111) plane is n = (h, k, l) = (1,1,1).

The distance between the planes is determined by the projection of the lattice vectors onto this normal.

Wait, but perhaps the formula for d is:

d = ( a ) / ( sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) )

Which brings me back to the same calculation as before. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the interatomic distance, not the lattice parameter. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, but the lattice parameter is different.

Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance (distance between adjacent atoms) is along the edges, so it's 'a', which is the lattice parameter. So if the question states the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, 'a' is 10.

But my calculation gives d=3.49, which is not an option.

Wait, let's look at the options again:

A) 9.08

B)8.95

C)9.54

D)10.05

If my calculation is 3.49, but the options are higher, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), but I'm using θ as 30 when it should be 60.

Wait, if θ is 60 degrees instead of 30, then cosθ=0.5.

So denominator = sqrt(3 - 2*(3)*0.5 )= sqrt(3 -3) =0. Impossible.

Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reciprocal of the plane.

Wait, the (111) plane is h=1, k=1, l=1.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) )

Which gave me 3.49.

But that's not matching. So perhaps the given answer is 10 divided by about 1.04, which would be around 9.6. But how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for interplanar spacing is:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl)*(1 - cosθ) )

Wait, let me compute that.

1 - cos30 = 0.13397.

So denominator = sqrt(3 + 2*(3)*0.13397 )

= sqrt(3 + 0.8038 ) = sqrt(3.8038)= ~1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.13. Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options. The options are around 9 Angstrom. So if 'a' is 10, perhaps the correct d is a / 1.1, which would be about 9.09. So option A is 9.08, which is close.

But how do I get 1.1 as the denominator?

Wait, perhaps the formula is using the reciprocal of the sum sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + ... ), but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / ( sqrt( (h +k + l)^2 ) ), but that's just a / |h +k + l|, which for (111) is a/3=3.33. Still not close.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I'm considering the wrong plane. Maybe the question refers to the (100) plane, but no, the question says (111).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

Which would make d=10 * sqrt(8.196)=10 * 2.863=28.63. Which is way higher than the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong angle. If the angles between the lattice vectors are 30 degrees, but the formula uses the angles between the planes?

No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But with θ=30 degrees, this gives sqrt(3 - 5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Hmm, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should compute the interplanar distance using the reciprocal lattice vectors.

In a rhombohedral system, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

h^* = (1/a) * ( h + k cos α/(1 - cos α) ) etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too deep.

Alternatively, the reciprocal lattice vectors can be given by:

b1 = (2π/a) [ 1, 1, 1 ] / sqrt(3)

Wait, no, that's for a simple cubic. Not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Miller indices to compute the plane's normal vector and then find the distance.

The (111) plane has a normal vector n = (1, 1, 1). The distance between the planes can be found using the formula:

d = (a) / ( |n| * sqrt( (h/a)^2 + (k/a)^2 + (l/a)^2 + 2*(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ) / a^2 ) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = [ a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a² (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ]^(-1/2)

Wait, this brings me back to the same denominator as before, 8.196, so d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is not 'a', but the distance between atoms in the basis. But in a simple rhombohedral lattice, the basis is just the corner atoms, so 'a' is the interatomic distance. So that shouldn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But wait, that's the same as before. So I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's re-calculate the denominator:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

sum = h² +k² +l² =3.

sum of cross terms: 2*(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ )

Since all angles are 30 degrees, each term is 1*1 * cos30 = 0.866.

So 2*( three terms) = 6 * 0.866=5.196.

So denominator: 3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.863.

d=10 / 2.863≈3.49.

But the options are higher. So perhaps the formula is inverted.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= 10 * sqrt(8.196)/3.

Because 8.196 is the sum, but I'm not sure.

Calculating sqrt(8.196)=2.863, so 10 *2.863=28.63. That's way too high.

Hmm.

Another idea: perhaps the question is about the (100) plane instead of (111), but the question clearly states (111).

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula uses (hkl) as (1,0,0), but no, that's not the case here.

I'm stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options. My calculation gives around 3.49, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is inverted, and it's the reciprocal.

Wait, d = sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) / a.

Wait, that would make d= sqrt(8.196)/10≈2.863/10≈0.286. But that's even smaller.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / ( sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

Which, in this case, would give sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

So 10 * sqrt(8.196)=10 *2.863≈28.63. Which is way higher than any option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l^2) ) / ( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(3)/(3 +5.196)= (10 *1.732)/8.196≈17.32/8.196≈2.11. Still not matching.

I'm not making progress here. So perhaps I should try to think about the possible correct approach.

Wait, I think I have the correct formula but I'm using it incorrectly. Let me restate the formula.

The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Which is the same as before. So with (111), angles 30, a=10, d=3.49.

So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are the supplement of the actual angles used in the formula. For example, if the actual angle between vectors is 150 degrees, cos(150)=-0.866.

So plugging into the formula:

d=10/sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-0.866) )

=10/sqrt(3 -5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196) → imaginary. No.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angles are 30 degrees, but the formula uses the angles between the reciprocal vectors, which would be 180-30=150 degrees.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors have angles of 180-30=150 degrees between them.

So in the reciprocal lattice, the angles are 150 degrees. So the formula would use cos(150)= -0.866.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos(150) )

=10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(-0.866) )

=10/sqrt(3 -5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196)

Which is impossible.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, if the formula is d= a / denominator, and denominator is 2.863, then d=3.49.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute 1/denominator as 1/2.863≈0.349, but that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the inverse of the formula. So d= a * sqrt( ... ) ?

Wait, for a simple cubic system, d= a / sqrt( h² +k² + l^2 )

Which works. So if in this case, the formula gives a d=3.49, but the options are higher, perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would make d=10*sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863≈28.63, which is way off.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) / (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)

Which would be 10 * 2.863 / 1.732 ≈10 * 1.653 ≈16.53, which is even worse.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = ( a ) / ( sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) ) * ( 1 + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ / (h² +k² +l²) )

Which for (111), denominator is 3, and (hk + ... ) is 3.

So:

d = 10/(sqrt(3)) * ( 1 + 2*3*cos30 /3 )

= (10/1.732) * (1 + 2*0.866 )

=5.773 * (1 +1.732)

=5.773 * 2.732≈15.81, which is not in the options.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck here. All my approaches lead to a value not matching the options. So perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option C)9.54, but I don't know why.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos(θ) )

Which would give:

d=10/sqrt(3 - 5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196). Impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos(180 -θ) )

Which would be 3 + 2*3*(-0.866)=3-5.196=-2.196. Again, impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the formula is written as:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) ) )

Which for (111) is 10/sqrt(3)=5.77 Angstroms. Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps the formula involves the volume of the unit cell. The volume V of a rhombohedral system is a^3 * sqrt(1 -3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ )

For θ=30 degrees:

V = 10^3 * sqrt(1 - 3*(0.866)^2 + 2*(0.866)^3 )

Compute:

3*(0.866)^2 ≈3*(0.750)=2.25

2*(0.866)^3≈2*(0.6495)=1.299

So inside the sqrt: 1 -2.25 +1.299= (1+1.299)-2.25=2.299-2.25=0.049.

sqrt(0.049)=0.221.

So V≈1000 *0.221=221 Ang^3.

But how does that help find the interplanar distance?

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance can also be expressed as:

d = a / ( sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) )

Which brings me back to the same calculation.

Hmm.

At this point, I've tried all the approaches I can think of, but I can't get the interplanar distance to match any of the given options. I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the calculated distance. So 1/3.49≈0.286. But the options are 8-10, so not matching.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the denominator. So denominator is 2.863, reciprocal is about 0.349. So d=10 *0.349≈3.49. Same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong angles. If the angles used in the formula are 180-30=150 degrees, but with cos150=-0.866.

Then denominator would be sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-0.866))=sqrt(3-5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which for θ=30 gives 3 -5.196= -2.196, which is impossible. So no.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would give d=10/sqrt(3-5.196)=10/sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the interplanar distance formula is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h +k +l)^2 + ... ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / ( sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) ) 

Which would give 10/sqrt(3)=5.77, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be:

d = a / ( sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) ) * ( 1 + something )

But I can't see what.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the angles in radians instead of degrees. Let me try that.

Wait, cos(30 degrees) is the same as cos(π/6 radians)=√3/2≈0.866. So no difference.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ )

Which would give 3.49, but the options are much higher.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863≈28.63. Not matching options.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck and can't find a way to get the calculated d to match any of the options. I might have to make a guess based on the options.

The only option close to my calculated 3.49 is not present. But the options are around 9 Angstroms. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula that I need to invert the denominator.

Wait, if the denominator is 2.863, then 10/2.863≈3.49. But if I take the denominator as the reciprocal, 1/2.863≈0.349, then 10 *0.349≈3.49. So no.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is using the reciprocal of the denominator. So d= a * sqrt( denominator )

Wait, that would be 10 *2.863≈28.63, which is not in options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is 1/2.863≈0.349, so d=10*(0.349)=3.49.

No, same result.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

But for (111) and θ=30, this gives negative inside the sqrt.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the volume of the unit cell and the relation to d-spacing.

The volume V is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2θ + 2 cos^3θ )

Which for a=10, θ=30:

V=1000 * sqrt(1 - 3*(3/4) + 2*(sqrt(3)/2)^3 )

=1000 * sqrt(1 - 9/4 + 2*(3*sqrt(3)/8) )

=1000 * sqrt( (4/4 -9/4) + (3*sqrt(3)/4) )

=1000 * sqrt( (-5/4) + (3√3/4) )

=1000 * sqrt( ( -5 + 3√3 ) /4 )

Compute numerator: 3√3≈5.196, so -5 +5.196=0.196.

So V=1000 * sqrt(0.196/4)=1000 * sqrt(0.049)=1000 *0.2214≈221.4 Ang^3.

But I'm not sure how to use this for d-spacing.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps using the relation between d and the volume.

The volume can also be expressed in terms of d-spacing:

V = (a^3) / ( d_hkl^2 * (hkl) ) )

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

Which again gives 3.49.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck and must concede that I don't see a way to get the correct answer from the options provided based on my calculations. However, if I have to choose the closest option based on a possible miscalculation, perhaps option B)8.95 is the intended answer. But I can't see how to arrive at that value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. Let me re-calculate the denominator.

Denominator = sqrt(3 + 6 * cos30 )

cos30=0.8660.

So 3 +6*0.8660=3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863=3.49.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the formula is:

d= a / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) ) )

Which would give d=10/√3≈5.77, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d= a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would be 10 * sqrt(8.196)=28.63, not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the angles as 60 degrees instead of 30.

So cos60=0.5.

Denominator: sqrt(3 + 2*3*0.5 )=sqrt(3+3)=sqrt(6)=2.449.

d=10/2.449≈4.08.

Still not matching options.

Hmm.

In conclusion, after trying multiple approaches and not finding a match, I must assume that I made a mistake in the formula. However, given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C)9.54, but I can't see how that would be derived.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance \( a = 10 \, \text{Å} \) and angles \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \), the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos \theta}}
\]

Here, \( h = 1 \), \( k = 1 \), \( l = 1 \), and \( \theta = 30^\circ \). Substituting these values:

1. Compute the sum of squares:  
   \[
   h^2 + k^2 + l^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
   \]

2. Compute the cross terms:  
   \[
   2(hk + hl + kl) = 2(1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) = 6
   \]

3. Multiply the cross terms by \( \cos 30^\circ \):  
   \[
   \cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
   \]
   \[
   6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196
   \]

4. Add the terms:  
   \[
   3 + 5.196 = 8.196
   \]

5. Take the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
   \]

6. Finally, calculate \( d \):  
   \[
   d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
   \]

This result does not match any of the provided options, which are all around 9–10 Å. Despite extensive recalculations and exploring alternative formulas, the derived value remains \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \). This suggests either a discrepancy in the formula or the options provided.

Given the mismatch, the closest option is **C) 9.54 Å**, though no clear derivation leads to this value based on the standard formula. The reasoning process indicates that the correct calculation yields \( d \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å} \), but since this is not among the options, an educated guess is made.

ANSWER: C
