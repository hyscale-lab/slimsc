Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate light travel time from the Sun's core to the Earth. So whatever happens in the Sun's core takes that long to reach us. So if pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from that reaction should stop reaching us, but the changes would be noticeable after about 8.5 minutes. But in this question, we're considering the state after that time has passed, so the neutrinos from that branch are no longer coming.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out how the flux in each band is affected.

First, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. The proton-proton chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then the pp-II and pp-III branches. Wait, the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce helium-4. Oh right, the main branch (pp-I) leads to deuterium, which then goes through pp-II and pp-III to form helium.

Wait, so the pp-III branch is part of the main proton-proton fusion process. If it stops, what happens to the neutrinos? Well, the pp chain produces neutrinos through the process of beta decay. In particular, the main neutrinos are from the decay of boron-8 (from the pp chain), but wait, I think in the pp-I and pp-II branches, they produce different byproducts. Or is it that the dominant neutrino production comes from a specific step in the pp chain?

Wait, no, wait. The dominant solar neutrinos come from two main processes: the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The majority, I think around 99%, come from the proton-proton chain. But wait, the CNO cycle also contributes a small fraction. But the question specifies the pp-III branch stopping, so it's about that.

Wait, but the main neutrino emission in the pp chain comes from the decay of Beryllium-7? Or wait, no. Let me think. In the proton-proton chain, the first step is two protons fusing into deuterium, then another proton fusing to form helium-3. Then, two helium-3 can either combine to form helium-4 and two protons (pp-I branch), or one can capture a proton to form boron-8 (pp-II branch), which then decays into alpha particles and emits a neutrino.

Wait, the Beryllium-8 is unstable and decays into two He-4 nuclei, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos come from the decay of Beryllium-7, which is part of the CNO cycle. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the Sun's neutrinos are primarily from two sources: the Beryllium-7
