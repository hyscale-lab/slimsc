Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to determine its chemical formula from the given options. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let me break down the information given from each technique.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak could also be from an amine, but the options don't include nitrogen, so probably O-H.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest something else. Oh wait, conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl? Or maybe an alcohol with something else?

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, which would make sense if there's a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what gives a m/z of 45. Common fragments include things like CH3COO- (which is 60?), or maybe CH2O groups. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3(O)O-? No, wait. Let me think: 45 is 45 g/mol. Let's see, possible ions at 45 could be C3H7O+, maybe? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, 45 is equal to (CH3)2O â€” which is 45? Let me check: Carbon is 12, H is 1, O is 16. So
