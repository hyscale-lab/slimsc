Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out what's being asked.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c * S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Then, among the four options (A to D), I need to determine which statement is correct regarding this calculation.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that angular momentum operators have specific properties. Since this is the Y-component, and the operator is a 2x2 matrix, it's likely dealing with spin-1/2 particles. Muons are fermions with spin-1/2, so that makes sense.

The operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S. So, let me write down the matrix S first. The first row is 0 and -i, the second row is i and 0. So S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Then, c is h/(4π), so A_y is c multiplied by this S.

Wait, but what's the unit here? Oh, right, since ħ is h/(2π), so c is h/(4π) = ħ/2. So c = ħ/2. 

So A_y = (ħ/2) * S. Therefore, the matrix A_y is:

(ħ/2) * [ 0   -i ]
         [ i    0 ]

Which can be written as:

[ 0        -iħ/2 ]
[ iħ/2      0 ]

Wait, no, because when you multiply each element by c, which is ħ/2. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is A_y φ = a φ. So I need to find the eigenvalues a and eigenvectors φ.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

Let me compute the matrix (A_y - a I):

[ -a     -iħ/2 ]
[ iħ/2   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) ) = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (ħ²)/(4) ) ]

Wait, (i)(-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes ( (iħ/2)( -i ħ/2 ) ) = (-i²)(ħ²/4) )= (1)(ħ²/4) = ħ²/4.

So determinant is a² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So a² = ħ²/4. Taking square roots, a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate that determinant part because I might have messed up the signs.

The determinant is (A11 - a)(A22 - a) - (A12)(A21). 

So A11 is 0, A22 is 0. So (0 - a)(0 - a) = a².

A12 is -iħ/2, A21 is iħ/2. So the product A12*A21 is (-iħ/2)(iħ/2) = (-i)(i) * (ħ²/4) )= (1) * ħ²/4.

Because (-i)(i) = -(i²) = -( -1 ) = 1.

So the determinant is a² - (ħ²/4) = 0 ⇒ a² = (ħ²/4) ⇒ a = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. The question says that c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2 because ħ = h/(2π). So c = ħ/2.

So the operator A_y is (ħ/2) * S, and S has eigenvalues ± ħ/2? Wait, no. Wait S is a matrix, so when I multiply by c, the eigenvalues of A_y are c times the eigenvalues of S.

Wait, no, no. Let me think. The matrix S itself would have eigenvalues ±1, since it's a spin-1/2 operator. Let me check.

What's the matrix S? It's [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]. The trace is zero, the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = (i²) = -(-1) = 1. Wait, no: (0)(0) is 0. (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (1) = -1?

Wait, no. The determinant of S is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2). Since i^2 is -1, so (-i)(i) = -i^2 = 1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1? So the trace is zero. The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - (trace) λ + determinant = 0 → λ² + (-1)=0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, that seems right. So S has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So A_y = c * S, so eigenvalues are c*(+1) = c and c*(-1) = -c.

Given that c is ħ/(2), as c is h/(4π) which equals ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues of A_y are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or ±2πh. Wait, the eigenvalue a is purely real, right? Because A_y is Hermitian? Or is it?

Wait, wait, S matrix: let's see. The matrix S is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. Its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not the same as S. So S is not Hermitian. Wait, but angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which should be Hermitian. So perhaps the matrix S is being defined differently. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, wait. The operator Ay is given as c * S. So if Ay is Hermitian, then c * S must be Hermitian. So S must be Hermitian as well because c is real. Let's check if S is Hermitian.

The conjugate transpose of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Comparing to S, which is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], the transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. So S is equal to its conjugate transpose. So S is Hermitian. Therefore, yes, S is Hermitian, so A_y is Hermitian because c is real. Therefore, the eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the eigenvalues of S, I found them to be ±1. So A_y has eigenvalues c*(±1) = ±c = ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So any options that suggest the eigenvalues have an imaginary part must be wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part are ±2πh or ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because eigenvalues are real.

Option B says imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. But again, the eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. That's a possibility. Because for angular momentum, the square of the operator commutes with each component, so eigenstates of A² and any component (say Ay) would be eigenstates of A². But whether they can be eigenfunctions of Az... Hmm, for a spin-1/2 system, the eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not an eigenfunction of Az. So that statement in option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not sure what this means. The basis functions would be the eigenvectors forming a basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis. But I'm not certain if this is correct.

Wait, but another approach: looking at the eigenvalues, which are ±ħ/2, which are real. So any option that doesn't involve complex eigenvalues is more likely correct.

So looking at the options, only options C and D are left, since A and B are incorrect.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

A² is (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²), and for a spin-1/2 system, A² has eigenvalue (1/2)(1/2 +1)ħ²= (3/4) ħ². So any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A² because [A², A_y] =0. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But for Az, since [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x, which is non-zero, so Ay and Az don't commute. So the eigenfunctions of Ay cannot be eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. That is, the eigenfunctions form a basis. Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors should form a basis for C^2, so this is true. So option D is also correct?

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So both C and D might be correct. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, the question says which statement is correct. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, let me read option D again: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Hmm, the matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors should form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, let's think again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not Az.

That's correct because A² commutes with Ay.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given.

So the eigenfunctions form a basis, which is correct. So both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, only one option can be correct. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with a single correct answer. So let's try to assess each option.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: Correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct. So during the process of finding eigenvalues and vectors, which statement is correct.

Another angle: looking at the matrix Ay, which is proportional to S. The eigenvectors of S are the same as those of Ay, because S and Ay are proportional. 

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors for S are the same as for Ay, but scaled by a factor. But the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but in the context of the question, which statement is correct during the calculation.

So if I'm calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, which statements are correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is correct because any 2x2 matrix's eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis.

So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options present them as separate choices; perhaps the correct answer is option D. Or maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing option C.

Wait, option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Since A² is a scalar operator (it's the Casimir operator), any eigenstate of A² is an eigenstate of A². So if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A² because [A², Ay] =0. So φ is an eigenfunction of both A² and Ay. So C is correct.

Now, what about Az? Since [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax, which is non-zero, so Ay and Az do not commute. Therefore, an eigenstate of Ay cannot be an eigenstate of Az. So C is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements? Or am I missing something?

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, in the question, the options are not mutually exclusive? No, each option is a separate statement, so the correct answer is the one that's correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So which of these statements would be true when you're finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

That is, the eigenvectors form a basis. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors would form a basis if they are two and linearly independent. So yes, D is a correct statement.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Yes, because as I mentioned, A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². But they can't be eigenstates of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So both C and D seem correct. But how can that be? Because the options are separate.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both C and D, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option A and B are about the eigenvalues having imaginary parts, but we know the eigenvalues are real (± ħ/2). So A and B are incorrect.

So the correct options are either C or D.

Now, let me think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². But since [Ay, Az] ≠ 0, eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

The matrix operator Ay is 2x2, so its eigenvectors are two in number (assuming they are distinct and non-degenerate, which they are for spin-1/2). So the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But since in the question, all the options are individual, perhaps the correct answer is that both statements are correct. But the options don't have combinations, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but in the options, only one is presented correctly.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about option D. Let me think again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay. So, the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, so any basis for this space would consist of two eigenvectors. So yes, the eigenfunctions form a basis.

So both C and D are correct. But if the options are set up to choose the correct one, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking at the given options, perhaps only option D is correct. Or perhaps option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is always correct, but perhaps the specific options provided don't include both.

Wait, the question says, which statement will you consider correct during the calculation.

So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Option C is a statement about the operator's properties and its eigenfunctions, which would be derived from the calculation.

Option D is a statement about the eigenvectors being the basis functions. Which is a true statement, but perhaps it's more about the nature of the eigenvectors.

But since both C and D are correct, but the options are separate, perhaps the intended correct answer is C or D. But the problem is, the given options don't have multiple correct answers.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² and Ay commute, yes, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Yes, because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is 2-dimensional.

So both C and D are correct statements. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. Let me read the question again.

The question says: during the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct?

So during the process of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So perhaps during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D) and that they are eigenfunctions of A² (C).

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is C, because D is a general statement that's always true for any matrix, but C is a specific point about the properties of the angular momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But I think the more correct statement is C. Because D is always true for any 2x2 matrix, but C is specific to the angular momentum operators.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice, so in the options, perhaps C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific eigenvectors.

The matrix Ay has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

The eigenvectors can be found by solving (Ay - a I) φ = 0.

For a = ħ/2:

Matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2   -iħ/2 ]
[ iħ/2    -ħ/2 ]

The equations are:

- (ħ/2) φ1 - (i ħ/2) φ2 = 0 → -φ1 -i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = -i φ2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [ -i φ2; φ2 ] = φ2 [ -i; 1 ].

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for a = -ħ/2:

The matrix is:

[ ħ/2   -i ħ/2 ]
[ i ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Equations:

(ħ/2) φ1 - i (ħ/2) φ2 = 0 → φ1 - i φ2 = 0 → φ1 = i φ2.

So the eigenvector is [ i; 1 ].

So these eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

Thus, both C and D seem correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps only one is the intended correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps both C and D are correct, but in the options, only C is presented as correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think again about the options.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Yes, this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator Ay.

Yes, correct.

So perhaps both are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, the options are:

A) Im(a) are ±2πh or ±2πh, Re(a) are ±h/(4π). → No, eigenvalues are real, so wrong.

B) Im(a) are ±1/2, Re(a) are ±1. → Wrong, eigenvalues are real.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. → Correct.

D) Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. → Correct.

So both C and D seem correct, but the options may only have one correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the matrix S, the trace is zero, and determinant is -1. So the eigenvalues are ±1, so when multiplied by c, we have ± c = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the real parts are ± ħ/2, and imaginary parts zero.

So none of the options A or B are correct.

Thus, the correct answers are C and D.

But in the given options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, the problem says, which statement will you consider to be correct. So during the calculation, you realize that the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenfunctions form a basis (D), and also that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² (C).

But since in the options C and D are separate, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the eigenvectors.

The eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Are these eigenfunctions also eigenfunctions of A²?

Yes, because A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix for spin-1/2 systems.

Wait, A² = (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²) = ( (ħ/2)² ) ( σ_x² + σ_y² + σ_z² ), where σ's are Pauli matrices.

Each Pauli matrix squared is identity, so σ_x² = I, same for others. So sum is 3 I. So A² = (ħ^2/4)(3 I) = (3 ħ²/4 ) I.

So A² acting on any vector is (3 ħ²/4 ) times the vector. So any eigenvector of Ay is also an eigenvector of A². So option C is correct.

Thus, in the given options, C is correct.

So the correct answer is C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -i \\
i & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(S - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real, as \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - Solving \( (A_y - a I) \phi = 0 \) for \( a = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvectors are proportional to:
     \[
     \phi_+ = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     -i \\
     1
     \end{bmatrix}, \quad
     \phi_- = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
     i \\
     1
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - These eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space.

3. **Option Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real (\( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \)), not complex with imaginary parts.
   - **Option B:** Incorrect. The eigenvalues are real, not complex, and their magnitudes are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), not \( \pm 1/2 \) or \( \pm 1 \).
   - **Option C:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are also eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, they cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - **Option D:** Correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space spanned by the operator \( A_y \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Both **C** and **D** are correct statements. However, since the question asks for the statement considered correct during the calculation, **C** is the more specific and relevant choice, as it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), which is directly relevant to the angular momentum properties.

ANSWER: C
