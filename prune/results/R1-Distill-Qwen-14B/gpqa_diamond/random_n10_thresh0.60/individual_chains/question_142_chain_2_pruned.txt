Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think I should break this down. Each term here is a projectors onto the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩. So when you take the density matrix, it's an equal mixture of these two states.

I remember that a single qubit state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical way to represent all possible states of a qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But wait, this ρ is a mixed state because it's a convex combination of two different projectors.

The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. So when it's a mixture, like here, it's a sum of such terms scaled by probabilities. In this case, each term has a coefficient of 1/2, so it's a 50-50 mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩.

Now, the Bloch vector representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) that determines the state's position.

Let me write that down. So, any single-qubit density matrix can be expressed as ρ = (I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z)/2. The vector (x, y, z) points to the point on the Bloch sphere that represents the state.

Given that, I need to find the Bloch vector r for the given ρ. Let me expand the given ρ:

Given ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that's the same as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2.

But I also know that |0⟩⟨0| is equivalent to (I + |0⟩⟨0| - |1⟩⟨1| + ... ) . Wait, maybe it's easier
