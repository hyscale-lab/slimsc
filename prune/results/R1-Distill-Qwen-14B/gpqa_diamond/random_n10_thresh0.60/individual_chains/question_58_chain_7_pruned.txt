Okay, I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. The question is about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a method used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. So the process involves introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you take the limit where the cutoff goes away. But why would some theories not require regularization?

Let me think about each option. Let's start with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, Classical Electrodynamics is a non-quantum theory, right? So it doesn't involve the same kind of divergences that quantum field theories do. In classical electromagnetism, you don't have issues like renormalization because it's not a quantum theory. So maybe D is the correct answer because it doesn't require regularization since it's not a quantum theory.

But let me check the other options to be sure. Option A is Superstring Theory. Superstring Theory is a type of string theory, which is a quantum theory of gravity. I think string theories, in general, aim to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kinds of divergences that other quantum field theories do. But wait, wait, aren't string theories still being developed? Do they require regularization? Or maybe because they have a higher-dimensional structure or a different way of handling interactions, they avoid the divergences naturally. Or perhaps they require regularization because at high energies (like the Planck scale), the theory might still need some kind of cutoff. I'm a bit unsure here. Maybe superstring theory doesn't need regularization because it's a theory that's supposed to be finite, so it inherently avoids the divergences without needing to regularize.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, and it's known to be a non-abelian gauge theory. I remember that in QCD, you have asymptotic freedom—quarks behave more freely at high energies. But as a quantum field theory, it deals with divergences. So it does require regularization when you calculate loop diagrams, right? So QCD would need regularization. So option B is not the correct answer.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established theory, but it's known to have issues with divergences. These are handled by renormalization, which involves regularization. Without regularization, the calculations lead to infinities, so QED does require regularization. So option C is not the correct answer.

So coming back, the question is which theory never requires regularization. If D is classical electrodynamics, which isn't a quantum theory, then it doesn't have the divergences that quantum theories have. Regularization is a quantum field theory technique, so classical theories wouldn't need it.

Wait a second, but does classical electrodynamics have any issues with high energies? Like, maybe the classical theory can't handle high energies because it breaks down and you need quantum mechanics. But the question is about whether regularization is needed. Regularization is a quantum thing, so classical theories don't need it. Therefore,
