Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember the question mentions the magnitude limits for each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the stars that both can detect need to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, actually, wait. Because if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17 for ESPRESSO, it's observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it must be brighter than 16. So, the star needs to be brighter than 16 mag because that's the more restrictive condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17. So, any star that is brighter than 16 V mag can be seen by both.

Wait no, wait the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag." So, ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So, to be observed by both, the star must be brighter than 17 mag? No, wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 16,
