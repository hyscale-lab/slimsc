Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says that the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay, is given by c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Wait, because I remember that Pauli matrices have similar structures. Oh right, the Pauli Y matrix is actually i times this S matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me check: the standard σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], so that's exactly S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay = c * σy. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Also, the question is about which statement is correct among the options A to D.

Eigenvalues of a matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0.

So let's write down Ay. Since σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]], then Ay is:

[0   -i*(h/(4π))]
[i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

So the matrix Ay is:

( h/(4π) ) * [0   -i]
             [i    0 ]

So to find the eigenvalues, set up the equation:

det( [ -λ       (-i h/(4π)) ] ) = 0
      [ (i h/(4π))   -λ ]

The determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (−i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) = λ² - [ (i)(-i) (h/(4π))^2 ].

Wait, let's compute determinant. The determinant is λ² minus the product of the off-diagonal elements. The off-diagonal elements are ( -i h/(4π) ) and (i h/(4π) ). So their product is (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2.

But (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is λ² - (h^2/(16 π²)) * 1 = 0.

So equation: λ² = h²/(16 π² )

So λ = ± h/(4π) * 1/2 ?

Wait, let me compute this again. Wait, λ² = (h/(4π))^2 → so λ is ± h/(4π) * [1], because sqrt( (h/(4π))² ) is h/(4π).

Wait no, wait. Let me recompute the determinant correctly.

Wait, the matrix is [[ -λ , (-i h/(4π) ) ], [ (i h/(4π) ), -λ ] ].

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π) )*(i h/(4π) ) ].

So first term is λ².

Second term: (-
