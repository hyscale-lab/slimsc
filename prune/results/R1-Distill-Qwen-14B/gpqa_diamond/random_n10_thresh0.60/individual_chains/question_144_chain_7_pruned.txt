Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (Lorentz factor) multiplied by the velocity. So the mean decay length L is approximately c * γ * β * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ from the given width Γ? Oh yeah, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime through the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I should be careful with the units. Let's jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the proper lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the Lorentz factor γ using E = γ m c^2. Since E is the total energy, γ = E / (m c^2). But since we're dealing in natural units where c=1, units might get tricky, but perhaps we can handle it with the given energies.
3. Also, find the velocity β. I think β is approximately v/c, and for high-energy particles, β is close to 1. But perhaps we can get a more precise value using the relation between energy, mass, and
