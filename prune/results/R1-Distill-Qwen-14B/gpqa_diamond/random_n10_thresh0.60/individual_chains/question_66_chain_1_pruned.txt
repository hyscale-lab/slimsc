Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But I'm not exactly sure which symmetries those are.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is a big one. Operators in the SMEFT have to respect Lorentz symmetry because the theory is built as an effective theory from the Standard Model, which itself respects Lorentz symmetry. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. I'm a bit confused here. SMEFT is a field theory, so it should respect Poincare symmetry. Because field theories are generally local and Poincare is a local symmetry. But wait, are all operators in SMEFT automatically respecting Poincare? Because Lorentz is part of Poincare, but operators are constructed to be Lorentz-invariant. So if they respect Lorentz, they might also respect Poincare, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe Poincare is a larger symmetry, but I think that since the theory is built in a way that respects Poincare, the operators would too.

Wait, no. The SMEFT
