Okay, so I have this physics problem about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor equation is probably what I need. The equation for the population of energy levels in LTE is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in energy level i, and n_j is the same but for level j. Since it's the same element (iron), the partition functions might be similar, but the problem states that the energy difference is the same, so maybe we can ignore that part.

Okay, in this case, the excited state is probably higher than the ground state, but the exact levels are not specified. But the key is that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. So the ratio n_i/n_j in star_1 is 2, and in star_2 it's 1. Let's think about the equation again.

So for star_1: (n_i / n_j)_1 = exp( - ΔE/(k T_1) ), because the energy difference is E_i - E_j = ΔE. Wait, no, wait: if the energy levels are E_i and E_j, and assuming i is higher than j (since it's excited), then E_i > E_j. So the ratio is n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But wait, in this case, the excitation is higher in star_1, so more atoms are in the excited state. So the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is higher than that of star_2.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2 * (n_i/n_j)_2. Because in star_1, the population of the excited level is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, let me clarify. The problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, I think
