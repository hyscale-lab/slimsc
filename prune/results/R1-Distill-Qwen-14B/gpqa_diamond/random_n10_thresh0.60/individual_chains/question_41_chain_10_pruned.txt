Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that when a medium is moving, how does it affect the speed of light observed?

Wait, right, the speed of light in a medium depends on the refractive index. Normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But here, the glass is moving at a velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. So I'm not sure if the movement of the glass affects the speed as observed in the lab frame.

I think about relativity here. Oh right, according to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the light is in glass, not a vacuum. So how does that apply?

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in the glass. The glass is moving. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n in the glass's frame, but when the glass is moving, how does that translate to the lab frame?

I remember something about the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh wait, but that applies when adding velocities of objects, like if you have two frames moving relative to each other. But here, the light is inside a moving medium. Is that the same situation
