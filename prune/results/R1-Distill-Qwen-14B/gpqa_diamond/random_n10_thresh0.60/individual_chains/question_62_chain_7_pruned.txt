Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident in my synthesis pathways yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. I remember that ethynyl groups are triple bonds, so maybe I need to expand that somehow.

Let me look at the target molecule. The name is a bit complicated, but I'll break it down. It has two cyclohexane rings. One of them is attached to a hydroxymethyl group that also has a cyclohexyl group, right? And the other part is a carbaldehyde. So I think the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a hydroxymethyl connected to another cyclohexane ring, and an aldehyde group attached.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. The molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main cyclohexane has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a hydroxymethyl group, which is CH2OH, but also attached to a cyclohexyl group. So it's like a bridge between two cyclohexanes? Or perhaps it's a substituent on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of it as a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl)methyl. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a methyl group attached, and that methyl has both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached. Oh wait, that doesn't make sense. The name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Oh, so the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is the main ring with an aldehyde group. The substituent is at position 1 (so on the same carbon as the aldehyde?) or perhaps the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituent is at another position? Maybe I should look for the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning a cyclohexane ring
