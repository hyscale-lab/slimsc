Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, so first, what are these stability constants? Oh right, the stability constant (β) indicates how stable a complex is. It's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So β1 is for the first complex, Co(SCN)n where n=1, β2 for n=2, etc.

So the complexes would be:
Co²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)²⁺ (n=1), β1=9
Co(SCN)²⁺ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)₂²⁺ (n=2), β2=40
Co(SCN)₂²⁺ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)₃²⁺ (n=3), β3=63
Co(SCN)₃²⁺ + SCN⁻ ↔ Co(SCN)₄²⁺ (n=4), β4=16

Wait, but in some cases, the stability constants are given for each step,
