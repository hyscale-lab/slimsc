Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question says the interaction Lagrangian is given by L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I remember that the Lagrangian describes how particles interact. So the boson X is interacting with some fermions here.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy, right? So the mass of X should be at least twice the mass of the decay products because energy and momentum have to be conserved. Oh, wait, actually, in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, each must have a mass less than or equal to half the mass of the parent particle. Because when the parent is at rest, the daughters can't have more mass than m_X/2 each.

So let's think about the possible decay products. The options given are various fermion-antifermion pairs: like b bbar, c cbar, s sbar, etc. So X can decay into pairs of these fermions.

First, I need to remember the masses of the quarks and leptons. Let me recall:

- Up quark (u): very light, about 2-5 MeV. So 0.002-0.005 GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar, around 3-7 MeV (0.003-0.007 GeV).
- Strange quark (s): about 95-105 MeV (0.095-0.105 GeV).
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV.
- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV.
- Neutrinos are even lighter, but they aren't in the options here.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. So each decay product (each fermion) should have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV).

Looking at the fermion masses:

- e: 0.0005 GeV. Way below 3 GeV, so e+ e- is allowed.
- μ: ~0.105 GeV, also allowed.
- τ: ~1.78 GeV, allowed since 1.78 <3 GeV.
- The quarks: let's see.
  - c is ~1.2-1.5 GeV. So 1.5 <3 GeV, so c cbar is allowed.
  - s is ~100 MeV, so allowed.
  - u and d are even lighter, allowed.
  - b quark is around 4.5 GeV, which is greater than 3 GeV. So b bbar would require each b to have 4.5 GeV, but 4.5*2=9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So b bbar decay is not allowed.
  - Top quark is way beyond, so t tbar is impossible.

Wait, but wait. When a particle decays into a pair, like X→ffbar, each f must have a mass less than m_X /2. So for X at 6 GeV, each f must be ≤3 GeV. So let's check each fermion:

- For electrons: yes.
- Muons: yes.
- Taus: yes. Because 1.78 <3 GeV.
- For quarks:
  - u, d, s: all under 3 GeV, so their pairs are allowed.
  - c: 1.5 GeV, allowed.
  - b: 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So b bbar is not allowed.
  - t: way too heavy, so no.

So possible decay channels are those where the fermion's mass is ≤3 GeV.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. But wait, b is too heavy. So this option includes bbbar, which is not allowed. So A can't be correct.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. All the fermions here have masses under 3 GeV. Let's check:

c: ~1.5 GeV. So 2c would be 3 GeV, which is within X's mass (6 GeV). So c cbar is allowed. So B includes all possible fermions except the bottom and top, which are too heavy. Wait, but B includes c cbar. So that's allowed.

Option C: Includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Oh, but t is way too heavy. So C is not correct.

Option D: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Again, includes b which is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B, which includes all the allowed fermions except b and t. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Looking again at the possible decay products: the allowed ones are e, mu, tau (because their masses are under 3 GeV), and the quarks u, d, s, c (since their masses are under 3 GeV). So the decay products should be any of these fermions and their antiparticles.

So the correct decay products should include all these except b and t.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's all the allowed ones.

Option C includes t, which is not allowed, so C is out.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a particle to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of each fermion must be less than or equal to half the mass of the parent particle, i.e., \( m_f \leq m_X / 2 \). Here, \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of the relevant fermions are as follows:
- \( u, d, s \): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (much less than 3 GeV, allowed).
- \( c \): \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 1.5 < 3 \)).
- \( b \): \( \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 4.1 > 3 \)).
- \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 173 > 3 \)).
- \( e \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( \mu \): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are into pairs of \( e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^-, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, \) and \( c \bar{c} \). Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) or \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed due to the masses of the \( b \) and \( t \) quarks exceeding 3 GeV.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \).

Answer: B
