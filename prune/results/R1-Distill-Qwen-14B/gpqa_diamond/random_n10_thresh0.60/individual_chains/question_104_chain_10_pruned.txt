Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity, right, that's the Doppler method where you look for shifts in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravity making the star wobble.

The question says that two stars with the same mass (like our Sun) each have a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the main thing here is that the stars are identical in mass, and the planets are same mass, but the RV shifts are different.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet. The shift in the spectral line is called the Doppler shift, and the amount of shift depends on the velocity. I remember the formula is something like delta lambda over lambda equals velocity over c, but maybe it's the other way? Or perhaps it's the same as the formula for the radial velocity: v = (delta lambda / lambda) * c, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact equation.

Wait, no. The Doppler effect formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity along the line of sight. So if the shift is 5 milliangstroms for planet 1, and 7 for planet 2, then their velocities would be in the same ratio as their shifts, since the stars are the same mass and the planets are same mass.

Wait, but wait. The RV method actually gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, K. So K is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet. The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something... Hmm, maybe I should think about the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Alternatively, since both stars have the same mass (M) and both planets have the same mass (m), the ratio of their RV shifts (K) should relate to some other factors.

Wait, the formula for K is given by:

K = [ (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) c)) ) ]^(1/ something? Hmm, maybe I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / (4π²) ) * ( (1) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * P
