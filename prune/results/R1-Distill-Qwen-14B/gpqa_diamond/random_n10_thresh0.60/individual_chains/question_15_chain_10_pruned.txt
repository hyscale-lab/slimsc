Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

So, the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same masses, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, their orbits are circular. 

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but they ended up with the same radii. So, same radius, different masses. 

The researchers want to choose the planet with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. The question is asking which planet they should observe more.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is given by the formula: P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (sqrt(a^2 - R_s^2))) ), but wait no, maybe I'm mixing some parts. Alternatively, the geometric probability for a planet to transit is roughly (R_*/a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, wait. I think the probability is actually (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by (something else?), or maybe it's R_star / (a * sqrt(1 - (R_star/a)^2))). Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, I think the geometric probability P is approximately (R_*/a), but that's a simplification. Let me think. The probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star (a). So P = (R_*) / (a) * (some factor), wait, no, maybe it's (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by (1/(something else)). Or perhaps it's (R_*/a) divided by sqrt(1 - (R_*/a)^2). I'm getting a bit confused. Let me see.

Wait, the transit probability P is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately R_s / a. But wait, no, that's not right. The formula I remember is P = (R_s / a)^2 * (1 / (1 - (R_s/a)^2 )^0.5 ). Wait, maybe that's when considering both the planet and star size. Alternatively, another approach is that the probability is given by the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the sphere as seen from the planet's orbit. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is roughly (R_s / a), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the probability is (R_*/a)^2 multiplied by something else. Oh wait, from what I recall, the probability is (R_s / a) multiplied by another factor. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

P = (R_s / a) * [1 / sqrt(1 - (R_s / a)^
