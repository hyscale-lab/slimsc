Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let's try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. The options are A, B, C, D, and each option gives the products for A, B, and C. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, let's tackle part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So the reagents are a base, probably deprotonating something.

Wait, the Michael addition is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile (enolate) attacks the β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. So in this case, dimethyl malonate is probably the nucleophile. But wait, dimethyl malonate is a diester, so it's a good Michael acceptor too. Hmm, but wait, maybe in this case, which one is the nucleophile and which is the electrophilic partner.

Wait, the setup says when a nucleophile attacks the β position, which produces an enolate. So dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. I think in the presence of a base like NaOEt, one of the ester groups' alpha protons would be abstracted, forming an enolate. The enolate would attack the β carbon of the other component, which is the α,β-unsaturated ester.

So the other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. It's CH2CHCOOCH3 with the E configuration, and the p-tolyl group is attached to the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but in E configuration, which means the substituents on either end are opposite.

Wait, wait, no: the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or maybe I got the numbering wrong. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the last, then the double bond, so the substituent would be on the middle carbon. Oh wait, maybe it's structured as CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C2.

So then, the Michael donor (the enolate) would attack the β position, which is the C2 in this case, but wait, the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So the β position is the CH2 part. Wait, no, the Michael addition typically adds to the β carbon relative to the carbonyl. So in the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl, the carbonyl is on C3 (as in CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3). So the β position is the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The α,β-unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is on the CH2 group. So the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. So the carbonyl is at the end. So the β carbon is the CH2 that's attached to the carbonyl. So when the enolate attacks, it adds to that β position.

Wait, the enolate from dimethyl malonate would have the structure like CH2-COOEt, but since it's dimethyl, it's (CH3O)2C-CH2-. The enolate would attack the β position of the acrylate. So the dimethyl malonate enolate attacks the β carbon of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So the attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would be a new compound where the malonate's enolate adds to the β position. So the product would have the two ester groups from dimethyl malonate attached to the new structure.

Let me try to write that. The acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate from dimethyl malonate is OEt2C-CH2- attacking the β carbon, which is the CH2 next to the carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Dimethyl
