Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different magnitude limits. Let me think.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that means the apparent magnitude has to be less than or equal to 17, right? Because if it's brighter than 17, it's magnitude is lower. Oh wait, magnitudes are a bit tricky. So a star with magnitude 17 is dimmer than 16, right? Because lower numbers are brighter.

Wait, wait, so if the instrument can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means stars with apparent V magnitude (apparent, so as seen from Earth) less than or equal to 17. Because when you say "brighter than 17", in magnitude terms, that's magnitude < 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent magnitude <16.

So the star must have apparent V magnitude ≤17 for ESPRESSO, and ≤16 for HIRES. So, to be detected by both, the star's apparent V must be ≤16.

Wait, but wait—if a star is brighter than 16 mag, can HIRES see it? Yes. And if it's also brighter than 17
