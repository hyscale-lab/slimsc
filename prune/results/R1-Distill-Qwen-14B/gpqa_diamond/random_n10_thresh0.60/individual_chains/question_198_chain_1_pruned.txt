Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in a solution. Hmm, let's see. 

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. So the complexes in question are probably different forms of Co with varying numbers of SCN- ligands. The question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands.
