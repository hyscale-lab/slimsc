Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the structure of Compound X and then determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the question gives me the IR and NMR data for Compound X. I remember that IR data can tell me about functional groups, and NMR gives information about the structure, like the number of protons and their environments.

Looking at the IR data: strong peaks between 3400-2500 cm-1. That wide range often indicates OH groups, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl group. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an OH group. Could it be a phenol ester or maybe a benzoic acid derivative?

Now the NMR data. Let's look at each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which often corresponds to an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids typically show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So maybe that's a COOH group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, probably aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted, since two protons are split into a doublet. So two Hs on one position, two on another. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the two Hs on each adjacent carbon would be doublets.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet. So if the aromatic ring has substituents in the para positions, this could be the case. Let me think, maybe the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4, with two Hs each in the 2 and 6 positions as one doublet, and 3 and 5 as another. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents in the para positions, but the substituents are such that the remaining Hs are as two doublets. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, the two Hs on each adjacent carbon would be equivalent, so perhaps each set is a doublet because of coupling with the other set. So that makes sense for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that are not identical. Like, perhaps one substituent is a COOH group and the other is something else, but wait, the IR has a 1720 cm-1 which is a carbonyl, maybe the COOH is present.

Wait, but let me think again. If the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, that's more like a carboxylic acid, since alcohols typically have a broad peak, but more around 1-5 ppm, but that's for OH in, say, an alcohol. Wait, no, wait: actually, in NMR, the OH of a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which matches the 10.5 ppm. So that's more likely a COOH group.

So if we have a benzene ring with a COOH group, let's think about how that would fit. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with a carbonyl, like a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700 cm-1). So, perhaps it's benzoic acid or a substituted benzoic acid.

But wait, let me look at the other NMR peaks. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 1H. That could be a CH group next to an electronegative atom or part of a chain. The 1.7 ppm is an m for 2H, maybe a CH2 next to something. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which is probably a CH3 group attached to something, maybe a CH2. The 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H, which is a typical terminal CH3 in an ethyl group. Hmm, so perhaps there's an ethyl group attached somewhere, but wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which is more like a CH3 attached to a CH that's connected to something else. Like a tertiary structure.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a substituted benzene with a COOH group, and a substituent that's a longer chain, perhaps a -CH(CH2CH3)2 or something similar. Wait, maybe it's a butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, let's try to piece it together. The aromatic region: peaks at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each a doublet for 2H each. So that suggests a para-disubstit
