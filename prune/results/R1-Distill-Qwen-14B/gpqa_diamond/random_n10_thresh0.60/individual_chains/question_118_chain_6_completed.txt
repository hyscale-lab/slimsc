Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the reaction between 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine. Hmm, I remember that cyclopentenols can undergo certain reactions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

First, I should draw the structure of 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Cyclopentene has a five-membered ring with a double bond. The "enol" part means there's an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So the structure would have a cyclopentane ring with a double bond at position 1 (so between C1 and C2). The hydroxyl group (-OH) is on C2, I think, because that's the enol form. And there are two methyl groups on C4. So, the numbering would be: C1 and C2 are double bonded, C2 has an OH group, and C4 has two methyl substituents.

Now, the reaction is with bromine. Bromine typically adds across double bonds in a diaddition, so I'm thinking of an addition reaction. But wait, in the presence of an enol, maybe there's a possibility of something else happening. Oh right, enols can undergo conjugate addition or maybe some dihydroxylation. Wait, but bromine usually adds to the double bond via an electrophilic addition.

Wait, what's the structure of the starting material again? It's 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, the OH is on C2. So, the structure is a cyclopentene ring with OH on C2, and two methyl groups on C4.

When bromine (Br2) adds to a double bond, it's usually a diaddition. The bromine adds across the double bond, leading to a dibromide. But wait, the starting material is an enol, so could it be that the OH group is conjugated with the double bond, making the addition more specific?

Alternatively, maybe the enol can lead to some kind of dihydroxylation, but I think that's more with other reagents like OsO4 or H2O2 with acid. Bromine tends to add in a dibromide without adding any hydroxyl groups.

Wait, but wait. When an enol reacts with bromine, perhaps the conjugated system makes the addition more likely. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, but where?

In a typical addition, Br would add to both carbons. So for cyclopentene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromocyclopentane. But in this case, the ring is substituted. So the substituents might influence where the addition occurs.

Wait, but in this case, the enol form is an allylic alcohol. So maybe the addition is more prone to happen in a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a simple addition but something else. Or maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? No, I think that's when you have water present, but here it's bromine.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The structure would have a cyclopentene ring (five-membered with one double bond), with the double bond between C1 and C2. The hydroxyl is on C2. Additionally, C4 has two methyl groups attached.

So, structure-wise, it's a cyclopentene ring where C2 has an -OH group, and C4 has two methyl groups. So, the substituents are at C2 and C4.

When Br2 is added, which is a diaddition, the bromine adds across the double bond. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Bromine adds Br atoms to each of these carbons. So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2.

Wait, but that's in a simple cyclopentene. But in this molecule, C2 already has an OH group. So that would make the product have Br on C1 and C2, and OH on C2. So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-2-hydroxycyclopentane... but wait, considering the substituents.

Wait, but the options given don't show an alcohol in the product. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol
Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone
Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone
Option D: (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol

Wait, so all options except B and C have a cyclopentanol structure (OH group). Options B and C are ketones (cyclopentanone), which suggests perhaps oxidation occurred.

Hmm, but the starting material is an enol. If the reaction with bromine leads to oxidation, perhaps it's a different process. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not just a simple addition but includes some oxidation.

Wait, but Br2 is a diaddition agent, not typically an oxidizing agent. Unless in specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the enol form can lead to a different reaction pathway.

Wait a second, I'm mixing up some reactions. Oh, wait! When an enol reacts with a halogen like bromine, it can lead to the formation of a bromoketone. Because the enol is an alcohol adjacent to a double bond. So, perhaps the mechanism here is that the double bond is conjugated with the OH group. Let me think about that.

In the enol form, the OH is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is similar to a conjugated diene but with an OH on one end. When bromine adds, it can form a bromide in a conjugated addition, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol can undergo a keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, but the starting material is the enol, so maybe that's already the reactive form.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be an electrophilic addition where the Br adds to the double bond, and the OH remains. But the product would have two bromine atoms added across the double bond.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A and D have two bromines and an OH. So perhaps those are the products if the addition occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a diol. Not sure.

Wait, another angle. Maybe the enol is a good nucleophile? But Br2 is a good electrophile, so the addition is more likely.

Wait, when an enol reacts with an electrophile like Br2, is there a possibility of the Br adding to the carbonyl carbon? Because the enol form can have a negative charge on the oxygen, but in this case, the structure is a cyclopentenol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let's think about the structure again. The starting material is an enol, which is a dihydroxy derivative of a ketone. Wait, no, enol is an alcohol with adjacent double bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition. For example, if we have a dienol, but in this case, maybe the bromine adds in a way that forms a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the addition of Br2 to the double bond leads to a vicinal dibromide, which is then oxidized. But wait, the reagent is just Br2, not something oxidizing.

Alternatively, perhaps the diaddition of Br2 leads to the formation of a dihalide, which then could undergo some elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation but with Br substitution. No, I think that's more with other reagents.

Another possibility: the enol form could lead to the formation of a more substituted carbocation upon addition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider the structure.

The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, structure is a five-membered ringâ€”positions are 1 (double bond), 2 (OH), 4 (two methyl groups).

When Br2 adds to the double bond, it would add Br across the double bond. So, positions 1 and 2 would each get a Br atom. So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and OH on C2, and the two methyl groups on C4.

So, the product would be 1,2-dibromo-2-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylcyclopentane. Looking at the options, options A and D are similar. They have 1,2-dibromo, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Wait, cyclopentanol would be a cyclopentane ring with an OH group. In the product, the OH is on C2 and the Br on C1 and C2. So, that fits the description of cyclopentanol.

Now, the options A and D are about the stereochemistry. The question is about the major outcome. So, which stereochemistry is correct for the addition of Br2 to the cyclopentene ring?

Wait, the starting material is a cyclopentenol. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The addition of Br2 would typically be in a trans addition, but in a cyclic system, the stereochemistry can get a bit tricky.

Wait, when Br2 adds to a cyclopropane, cyclobutane, or cyclopentane double bond, the addition can form either a vicinal dihalide with a particular stereochemistry. But in a five-membered ring, the addition might lead to a more stable transition state.

Wait, in general, bromine adds in a trans fashion. So, for a cyclopentene, adding Br2 would give a trans dibromide. So, the Br atoms would be on opposite faces.

But wait, the starting material is an enol, which has an OH on C2. So, adding Br to C1 and C2, the configuration would depend on the approach of Br2.

Wait, the starting molecule is a cyclopentenol, so when the Br2 approaches, the Br atoms add across the double bond. The transition state would have the Brs adding in a trans manner.

But considering the ring structure, the diastereomer formed would depend on the addition.

Wait, if the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol, which is a ring with substituents at C2 (OH) and C4 (2 methyl groups). When adding Br to C1 and C2, the addition would form two new stereocenters: C1 and C2.

So, the product would have Br on C1 and C2, and the OH on C2. The configuration (R/S) would depend on the addition.

But looking at the options, both A and D are 1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, but with different configurations: A is (1R,2S), D is (1R,2R).

Wait, how is the stereochemistry determined here?

I think that when bromine adds across a double bond, the addition is stereospecific, and the stereochemistry depends on the geometry of the starting double bond. But wait, the starting material is cyclopent-1-enol, which I think is a cis or trans double bond?

Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. Since the ring is cyclopentene, the substituents around the double bond would be in a certain configuration.

Wait, but in a cyclic system, the double bond is fixed. So, the substituents on either side of the double bond (C1 and C2) would have their substituents arranged in a certain way.

But perhaps considering the chair-like transition state is not applicable here because it's a five-membered ring, so the transition state for bromine addition is more likely to be a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate.

So, when Br2 adds, it forms a bromonium ion intermediate, which then opens up with Br- attack from either side.

Wait, in the case of a cyclopentene, adding Br2 would form a five-membered cyclic bromonium ion. Then, the bromide ion would attack from the less substituted side to open the ring.

But wait, the substituents on C2 include the OH group and the ring. Hmm, perhaps the attack occurs from the less hindered side.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a specific configuration that affects the outcome.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the stereochemistry. Let me think differently.

The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. The OH is on C2, and the double bond is between C1 and C2.

When Br2 adds, the addition is anti because of the cyclic bromonium intermediate. So, the Brs add on opposite faces.

So, in the starting material, the substituents on C1 and C2 would influence the stereochemistry of the addition.

Wait, but in the case of a ring, the substituents are constrained. So, when the cyclic bromonium ion forms, the Brs are on opposite sides. Upon opening, the bromide ion attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side.

Wait, perhaps the major product would have the Brs on opposite faces, leading to a trans-die addition.

But looking at the options, options A and D have different configurations. So, which one is correct?

Another approach: perhaps the cyclopentanol formed has the Brs on adjacent carbons. The options A and D both have 1,2-dibromo.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed via a bromonium ion but via some other mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol leads to the formation of a carbocation upon addition of HBr, but that's more in acid conditions. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when bromine adds to a double bond, it can lead to vicinal dihalide. But in this case, the double bond is adjacent to an OH group, which is a good leaving group.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't a simple addition but involves some kind of elimination followed by addition, but that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the enol can form a ketone upon oxidation, but I don't think Br2 is an oxidizing agent in this context.

Wait, looking back at the options, options B and C are ketones. Could the reaction lead to the formation of a ketone?

Wait, if the enol reacts with Br2, perhaps there's an elimination of HBr, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but that's usually in the presence of a base, perhaps. For example, the enol could lose water and form a carbonyl, but I'm not sure how Br2 would facilitate that.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of Br across the double bond leads to a dihalide adjacent to the OH group, which then undergoes some elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the Br adds to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the starting material doesn't have a carbonyl; it's an enol. So, maybe the enol is oxidized to a ketone with addition of Br.

Wait, if the starting material is an enol, upon reaction with bromine, maybe it forms a bromoketone. Wait, bromoketones are formed when an enol reacts with a brominating agent, like N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in presence of light or peroxides, leading to allylic bromination. But in this case, the reagent is Br2, not NBS.

Wait, that's an important distinction. Wait, NBS leads to allylic bromination, but Br2 is more for addition across double bonds.

Hmm, but maybe in this case, the double bond is part of an enol, making it susceptible to allylic bromination. Wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2, then adding Br2 would add across the double bond, not necessarily allylic.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, adding Br to C3, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently. What are the possible products from adding Br2 to an enol?

I think the main reaction would be the diaddition of Br across the double bond, leading to a 1,2-dibromo alcohol. So, that would match options A and D.

Now, the question is about the stereochemistry. So, the addition of Br2 is stereospecific, leading to either retention or inversion.

Wait, in cyclic bromonium ion intermediates, the bromides attack from opposite sides, leading to anti addition. So, the two Br atoms would be on opposite faces.

In the starting material, the OH is on C2. So, when adding Br to C1 and C2, the Br on C1 would be on one side and Br on C2 on the opposite.

But how does that translate into the R/S configuration?

Let me imagine the structure. Let's say the cyclopentene ring is drawn with C1 at the top, double bond to C2. The OH is on C2. So, when Br adds, the Br on C1 would be on one face, and Br on C2 on the opposite face.

Wait, but since the ring is planar around the double bond, the addition can occur from either face leading to different diastereomers.

But in a five-membered ring, the transition state would likely form a bromonium ion where the Brs are on opposite sides. Then, when the ring opens, the Brs are added anti.

So, the two Br atoms would be on opposite faces, leading to a trans arrangement around the C1-C2 bond.

So, in the product, the Brs would be on opposite sides of the ring.

But considering the substituents, the configuration would depend on the starting structure.

Wait, the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, when the ring is drawn, C4 has two methyl groups. So, the ring is such that C4 is adjacent to C5 and C3, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the one with the Brs added in such a way that the two Brs are on opposite faces relative to the ring.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't show that. Looking at the options, options A and D have specific configurations.

Wait, but the question is about the major outcome. So, perhaps I need to consider which option is more likely based on stereoelectronic factors.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is a cyclopentenol. Adding Br2 would form a dibromide with Br on C1 and C2. But the OH is on C2, meaning that after addition, C2 has two substituents: Br and OH.

So, the product would have two stereocenters at C1 and C2.

In the options, A is (1R,2S), D is (1R,2R). So, which is more likely?

Hmm, perhaps the addition leads to both Brs being on the same face, but I thought it was anti.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the stereochemistry wrong. Let me think in terms of chair-like conformations, but for a cyclopentane.

Wait, perhaps the bromonium ion forms with the Brs on the same face. Then, the attack would be from the opposite face, leading to the Brs being on opposite sides.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should just proceed with what I know.

The product would be 1,2-dibromo-2-hydroxy-4,4-dimethylcyclopentane. This matches options A and D.

Now, the question is about the configuration. The starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. Let's imagine the double bond is in the ring. The bromine adds across the double bond. The bromonium ion would form, and the bromide would attack the more substituted carbon.

Wait, bromine addition tends to follow Markovnikov's rule, but in rings, it's a bit different. Alternatively, the attack can be from either side, leading to different stereoisomers.

But in a cyclic system, the bromonium ion has a certain geometry. The Brs are on adjacent carbons, and the ring opens in a way that the Br adds from the less substituted side.

Wait, perhaps the major product would have the Brs in a trans configuration across the ring.

But without a clear model, it's hard to see exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a trans dibromide. So, in the product, the Brs are on opposite faces.

But considering the position of the OH group, which is on C2, the configuration around C2 would be influenced by that.

Wait, perhaps the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1R,2R). So, how does the bromide ion attack the bromonium ion?

In the cyclic bromonium ion, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons and on the same face. When the bromide attacks, it opens the bromonium ring by attacking the less substituted carbon from the opposite face.

Wait, but in a small ring like cyclopentane, the attack might be from the less hindered side, which depends on substituents.

But in this case, perhaps the attack occurs from the side opposite to the two methyl groups on C4.

Alternatively, maybe the attack leads to the Brs being on the same face, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the major product is a racemic mixture, but the options don't reflect that. So, perhaps the correct answer is either A or D.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol. So, the substituents on C4 are two methyl groups, which are bulky. When the bromonium ion forms, the bromide would attack the less hindered position.

So, the bromide would attack the C1 (since C2 has the OH and adjacent substituents) from the opposite face, leading to the Brs being on opposite sides.

So, for C2, which already has an OH group, adding Br from the opposite face would lead to a specific configuration.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would have the Brs in a cis configuration due to the ring's constraints.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the options and see which one makes more sense.

Option B: 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. That implies that the OH group has been oxidized to a ketone and a Br is added. But I don't think Br2 is an oxidizing agent here. Unless, perhaps, there's some elimination. But I'm not sure.

Option C: 4-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. That suggests bromination at C4 and a ketone. Again, I'm not sure how that would happen.

So, perhaps options B and C are incorrect because the reaction is more likely to add Br across the double bond rather than oxidize or brominate elsewhere.

So, focusing on options A and D.

Now, the difference between A and D is the configuration at C2. Option A is (1R,2S), D is (1R,2R).

Which configuration is more likely after anti addition?

Assuming that during the bromonium ion opening, the Br- attacks from the opposite face, leading to the Br on C1 being on one face and the Br on C2 on the opposite.

If the starting material's OH on C2 is on the same face as the methyl groups on C4, the addition of Br would place the Brs on opposite faces.

But without a clear model, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the meso compound, but the options don't show that.

Wait, another approach: cyclopentanol with 1,2-dibromo and two methyl groups. The configuration would have the Brs on opposite sides.

But the options don't have a meso option. So, perhaps the product has the two Brs on the same face due to ring strain.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should think about the diastereomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, if the enol reacts and the double bond is broken, perhaps the OH group is retained, but the ring forms a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the enol could undergo oxidation to a ketone, but I don't think Br2 would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition of Br2 leads to a dihalide, and then elimination occurs, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, that would make sense. For example, if after adding Br2, an elimination reaction (like E2) occurs, removing HBr and forming a carbonyl group.

So, the dihalide could lose two equivalents of HBr, leading to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, but that would require two elimination steps. So, the product would be a ketone with a Br somewhere.

Looking at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, a ketone at C1 (since it's a cyclopentanone, the carbonyl is between C1 and C2, perhaps), with a Br on C2.

Wait, but in this scenario, the initial addition of Br2 would form a dihalide, then two eliminations would form the carbonyl group and release two HBr molecules.

But would that happen with Br2 as the only reagent? I'm not sure. Typically, elimination requires a base.

Hmm, but the presence of Br- could act as a base in some cases. So, perhaps after the diaddition, an elimination occurs, leading to the ketone.

So, if that's the case, the product would be a ketone (cyclopentanone) with a Br attached.

Looking back at the options, option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. That would imply the ketone is at C1 (or C2?), and a Br is on C2.

Alternatively, the ketone would be at the position where the double bond was. So, the initial double bond between C1 and C2 would, upon elimination, form a carbonyl group between them. So, the ketone would be at C1 and C2.

But wait, cyclopentanone is a five-membered ring with a ketone group, meaning the carbonyl is at one position, say C1.

So, the product would be 1-keto-2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentane.

But the option B is 2-bromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanone. So, the ketone is at C1, and Br is at C2.

So, that would fit. So, the major product would be option B.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think: when an enol reacts with bromine, could it form a bromoketone via a different mechanism?

Wait, when an enol reacts with a brominating agent, like NBS under certain conditions, it leads to allylic bromination, forming a ketone. But in this case, the reagent is Br2, which is for addition.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize.

The possible scenarios:

1. Br2 adds across the double bond, forming a vicinal dibromide with OH on C2. This gives options A and D.

2. Br2 adds, followed by elimination to form a ketone, giving options B or C.

Which is more likely?

Well, in the presence of Br2, addition is more typical than elimination unless a base is present. So, scenario 1 is more likely.

Thus, the product would be a dibromide with OH, which would be options A or D.

Now, the question is about the stereochemistry.

In the case of anti addition, the Brs would be on opposite faces. So, the configuration would be (1R,2S) or (1S,2R). Looking at options A and D:

Option A: (1R,2S)

Option D: (1R,2R)

Which one is more likely?

Wait, during the bromonium ion formation and opening, the Br- would attack from the opposite face, leading to anti addition. So, if the starting material has the OH on C2 in a certain configuration, the addition would lead to the Brs being on opposite sides.

Assuming that the starting material's OH is on the same face as the methyl groups, the addition would place Brs on the opposite face.

But without knowing the exact starting structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that would require elimination. Alternatively, perhaps I should go with the addition product.

But wait, another thought: the starting material is a conjugated enol, which might make it more reactive towards bromine. Maybe the bromine adds to the less substituted end, leading to a different configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the major outcome is the formation of a ketone with a bromine substituent.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, I'm a bit torn between A and B.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stability of the carbocation intermediate. If the addition of HBr leads to a more stable carbocation, then that would be favored. But again, without a base, I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the reaction is a bromohydrin formation, but that involves adding HBr and water, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a bromonium ion, which could lead to ring opening with attack from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Given the time I've spent, I think the most plausible answer is option B or A. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the starting material is 4,4-dimethyl, which is a substituent that would cause the ring to have a certain geometry. The addition of Br would be influenced by the steric effects.

If the bromide attacks from the less hindered side, perhaps the Brs end up in a certain configuration.

But without a clear model, it's hard to determine.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product is the less substituted dihalide, but in a ring, that's not applicable.

I think I've spent enough time. Based on the initial analysis, the reaction would add Br across the double bond, leading to a vicinal dihalide with OH. So, the product would be options A or D.

Now, considering the stereospecific addition, the major product would have the Brs in a trans configuration. So, the configurations would differ between C1 and C2.

So, looking at the options, option A is (1R,2S), which is a meso compound if possible, but in this case, it's not because there are two methyl groups on C4, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, 4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol would have the ring with substituents on C2 (OH and Br) and C4 (two methyl groups).

So, C1 would have a Br and two CH2 groups from the ring.

Wait, perhaps C1 and C2 are both stereocenters.

Assuming that, then the product would be a diastereomer.

So, the correct answer would be either A or D.

But which one? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because during the addition, the Brs are added with opposite configurations.

Alternatively, I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Considering that the addition is anti, the configurations would be opposite. So, if C1 is R, C2 would be S.

So, option A is (1R,2S), which would make sense for an anti addition.

Thus, I'll go with option A.


The reaction involves 4,4-dimethylcyclopent-1-enol and bromine (Brâ‚‚). The starting material is an enol, which has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2 in a five-membered cyclopentane ring. Additionally, there are two methyl groups on C4. Bromine typically adds across double bonds via electrophilic addition, forming a vicinal dibromide. 

When Brâ‚‚ adds to the double bond, it forms a bromonium ion intermediate, which then opens up with anti addition of bromine atoms. This anti addition results in the bromine atoms being placed on opposite faces of the ring. The product is a vicinal dibromide with the hydroxyl group remaining on C2. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the anti addition mechanism.

The two methyl groups on C4 influence the steric environment, but the anti addition mechanism ensures that the bromine atoms are added to C1 and C2 in a trans configuration. This results in a product with two stereocenters at C1 and C2. Among the given options, the correct product must match the expected stereochemistry of the anti addition.

Option A, (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, aligns with the anti addition mechanism and the expected stereochemistry. Option D, (1R,2R)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol, does not match the anti addition mechanism. Options B and C involve the formation of a ketone, which is unlikely under the given reaction conditions with Brâ‚‚.

Thus, the major outcome of the reaction is (1R,2S)-1,2-dibromo-4,4-dimethylcyclopentanol.

Answer: A
