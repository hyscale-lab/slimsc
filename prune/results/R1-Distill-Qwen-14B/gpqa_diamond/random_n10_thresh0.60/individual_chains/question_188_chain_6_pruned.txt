Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, right? So that's a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. Oh right, so in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and α = β = γ. In this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, so I think that's the a, b, c parameter. And all angles are 30 degrees. 

The interplanar distance formula usually is d = a/(sqrt(h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + ... something with the angles...)). Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Oh right, for cubic systems, it's simpler because angles are 90 degrees, but here it's a different case because the angles are all 30 degrees.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - (h^2)/(a^2)(cos^2 α / sin^2 α) ... No, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, I think the formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is a bit more involved because of the angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 +
