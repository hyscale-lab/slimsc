Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry results. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak, often around 2500-3300, and that's usually a strong, broad peak. Alternatively, alcohols also show O-H stretches around there, but maybe less broad? Hmm. Also, the FTIR shows strong absorption at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are important regions. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds or something else). Wait, another thought: sometimes the 1650 region can correspond to conjugated carbonyls or maybe an ester or amide, but more likely, the 1700 is definitely a carbonyl. Wait, another point: if both 1700 and 1650 are present, maybe it's something with two different carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and another is something else. Let's think: what about an ester? Esters have a carbonyl around 1700-1750, and maybe the 1650 could be from an adjacent group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe one is an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching, which is usually around 1600-1650
