Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. It's about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The question is about determining the momentum of a photon that causes a transition from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, wait, I remember that in rotational and vibrational spectroscopy, molecules can absorb photons that cause transitions between energy levels. For diatomic molecules, the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, and the next would be the first excited state.

The problem gives me the masses of the two atoms, X and Y. Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. Oh wait, amu is the atomic mass unit. I think I need to convert that into kilograms because the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms.

Bond length R is 2 angstroms. Oh right, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 meters.

Angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. Angular frequency usually relates to the vibrational energy, I think, since vibrations involve oscillations which have their own frequency.

The question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum of a photon is related to its wavelength or energy. Since photons carry momentum p = E/c, where E is energy and c is the speed of light. Alternatively, p = h / Î», but that might not be the most straightforward way here.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state. The next state with the lowest possible energy... Hmm. Wait, in the rotational-vibration model, transitions can change both rotational and vibrational states, but the selection rules might allow for certain changes.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the ground state. The next state with the lowest possible energy could involve a transition to the next vibrational state, like from v=0 to v=1, or perhaps a change in rotational state, like from J=0 to J=1.

Wait, but for diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational energy levels are quantized. The non-rigid rotor model (also called the rotational-vibrational model) includes both rotational and vibrational energy. The total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational contributions.

The fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational state, v=0. The next state would be v=1. But when it comes to transitions, photons usually cause either a change in vibrational state or a rotational state, but which one is more probable?

Wait, but the question specifies that the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which likely is v=0, J=0. If the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state (v increases) or increase its rotational state (J increases).
