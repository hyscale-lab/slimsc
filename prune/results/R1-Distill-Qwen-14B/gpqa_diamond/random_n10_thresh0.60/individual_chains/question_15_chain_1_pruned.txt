Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the planet's orbit.

The question says that researchers have two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They've already found these using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives them the minimum mass and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right?

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So same radius but different masses. I think more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's host is a slightly evolved star but smaller in radius? Or maybe they're both at the same radius for another reason.

The question is about the probability of transiting. I remember the transit probability formula is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something related to the orbital distance. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s) squared, but also depends on the orbital distance. Because the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to align with our line of sight. I think the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / R_s), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual transit probability formula. From what I recall, the probability P is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (a / R_s) * (1/R_s) ), but wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (a) / (R_s * sqrt(a^2 + (R_s)^2)) )) ), but that sounds complicated. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance (a) in some way.

Wait, perhaps a better approach. The transit probability (P) is calculated using the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_s) ), where a_s is the semi-major axis in units
