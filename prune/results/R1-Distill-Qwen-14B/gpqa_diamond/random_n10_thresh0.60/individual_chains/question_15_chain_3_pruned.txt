Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their stars. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is one way to detect exoplanets. The idea is that when a planet passes in front of its star from our perspective, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same. But the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

The stars they orbit have the same radius. But Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius? Interesting. I think more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_1's star is in a different stage or something. Oh, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so maybe it's expanding a bit, but their radii are same. So R_star1 = R_star2.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (1 / (a_planet * sin i)), no wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think. The geometric probability of a transit is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else. Or wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_planet + R_star) / (a_planet * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator is a_planet. So the probability simplifies. But I think the actual formula is P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a_p)) ), but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbit is edge-on enough. Wait, no, the formula for the probability that a randomly oriented orbit would result in a transit is (R_p / R_s)^2, but that's not considering the orbital separation. Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is actually (R_p
