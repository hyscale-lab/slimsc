Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries involved, so I need to think this through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let's break them down one by one.

First, what's Lorentz symmetry? Lorentz symmetry refers to the invariance of the theory under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. This is crucial because our spacetime is described by Minkowski space, and all physical laws should be the same for all observers regardless of their relative velocities. Effective theories like SMEFT must respect this because they're built upon the Standard Model, which itself respects Lorentz symmetry. So, I think Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations (like spatial and temporal)? Poincare symmetry includes the full set of symmetries of Minkowski spacetime. But wait, SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible operators without introducing new particles. So, would SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? Well, the Standard Model does respect Poincare symmetry, and SMEFT adds higher-dimensional operators while maintaining the same symmetries as the SM. So SMEFT should respect Poincare symmetry too. So option 2 (Poincare) must be respected. But wait, wait a second. SMEFT is built from terms that are compatible with the SM's symmetries, but when you include higher-dimension terms, do they necessarily have to respect Poincare? I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, because the effective theory is valid only up to a certain energy scale, but all terms must still transform correctly under the Poincare group because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. So yes, Poincare symmetry (2) must be respected.

Wait, but wait. The Poincare group includes translations. SMEFT includes derivatives in operators (like terms with covariant derivatives), which are translation-invariant. So yes, all operators must preserve Poincare symmetry, meaning options 1 and 2 are both correct. So that's points 1 and 2.

Now, what about CP symmetry (option 3)? CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric; for instance, there's the CKM mechanism leading to CP violation. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP because the effective theory allows for all possible operators that are renormalizable and higher-dimensional, provided they don't introduce new physics below a certain scale. But does the effective theory have to respect CP? No, because operators can violate CP. For example, the Weinberg operator in the neutrino sector violates CP. So operators in SMEFT can break CP, meaning that CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators. So option 3 is not a must.

Lastly, CPT symmetry (option 4). CPT stands for Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The CPT theorem states that all theories satisfying the relativistic quantum mechanics (i.e., those that are Lorentz invariant and have a unitary S-matrix) must be CPT symmetric. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory and it's a quantum field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4 is correct).

Putting it all together: the symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the options would be 1,2, and 4.

Looking back at the options:

A) 1,2 → includes 3,4 not considered. But I think CPT (4) is required, so A can't be correct.

B) 3,4 → no, we're not respecting 3 always.

C) 1,2,4 → this looks correct.

D) 1,3,4 → but 3 is not necessarily respected.

So the correct answer should be option C: 1,2,4. Wait, but wait. Wait, Poincare symmetry (2) is a combination of Lorentz and translations. If the theory already respects Lorentz symmetry (1), does it automatically respect Poincare? Or are they separate symmetries? Because Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But in the question, the options are 1 and 2, so both are required. But actually, no. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. If a theory respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. But do SMEFT operators have to respect both, or would respecting Poincare imply Lorentz is already taken care of? Hmm, perhaps the question is considering them separately. But I think that in SMEFT, operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. So maybe the question includes both as separate requirements.

Wait, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, and must be Poincare invariant as well. Because Poincare includes translations, which are about the invariance under shifting positions and times. So SMEFT operators are local, so they must respect translations. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries (1 and 2) must be respected.

So the correct required symmetries are 1,2,4. So the option is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators while respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry requires invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Since SMEFT is built upon the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and invariance under spacetime translations. SMEFT operators are local and translation-invariant, as they are constructed using derivatives and fields. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model is not CP-symmetric, and SMEFT allows for operators that can violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant and a quantum field theory, it must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is required.

From the analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
