Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so that the researchers should observe that one. Both planets are Earth-like, and they've been detected via the RV method. So I have some info about their masses and orbital periods. Let me try to break this down.

First, the question says both planets have the same mass. So their masses don't affect the transit probability directly in this case. But wait, the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but since they've been detected, maybe the mass is confirmed? Hmm, but the problem says they have the same masses, so that detail might not matter for the transit probability.

Now, the orbital periods: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period P, Planet_1 has P/3. Since orbital period relates to the distance from the star (using Kepler's third law), I think a shorter period means Planet_1 is orbiting closer to its star. Right, because closer planets orbit faster.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. That's interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger, but in this case, their radii are the same. So maybe Planet_2's star is a bit evolved, which might mean it's a subgiant or something, but same size.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on from our point of view, but that's more about the inclination. But when considering all possible inclinations, the probability is proportional to R_star (the star's radius) divided by the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit (a). Because the formula for transit probability (P) is roughly (R_p / a) * (R_p / R_star), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up.

Wait, transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a (1 - e²)^0.5) ), but wait, for a circular orbit (e=0), it's (R_p + R_s) / a, but wait, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because the chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is higher when the orbit is closer to the star. So the formula is something like (R_star / a). But since both R_star are the same, it depends on a inversely. So a smaller a would mean higher probability.

But wait, the semi-major axis (a) can be found using Kepler's third law: (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_star + M_planet) / (4π²). Since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M as just the star's mass. So a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1: a1 proportional to ( (P1^2) * M1 )^(1/3 )

For Planet_2: a2 proportional to ( (P2^2) * M2 )^(1/3 )

But P1 is P2/3, and M1 is 2*M2. So let's plug in the numbers.

Let me denote M2 as M, so M1 is 2M.

P1 = P2 /3.

So a1^3 = ( ( (P2/3)^2 ) * 2M ) / (4π²) ), but wait, perhaps it's better to compute the ratio a1/a2.

Let me compute a1 / a2.

a1^3 / a2^3 = [ ( (P1^2 * M1 ) ) ] / [ (P2^2 * M2 ) ) ]

Substituting P1 = P2/3, M1=2M2,

= [ ( ( (P2/3)^2 ) * 2M2 ) ] / [ (P2^2 * M2 ) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: (P2² / 9) * 2M2 = (2 P2² M2 ) /9

Denominator: P2² * M2 

So ratio is (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

Therefore, (a1/a2)^3 = (2/9) → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3).

So a1 is smaller than a2. Since a is the semi-major axis, a1 is smaller. So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Now, transit probability depends on R_star / a. Since R_star is same for both, Planet with smaller a would have higher (R/a), which increases the probability of transit.

So transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but wait, I'm not sure. Let me double-check.

Wait, the transit probability formula is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * something else? Or is it R_planet / a? Hmm, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_s + R_p)^2 / (a^2 (1 - e²)) ) * (something else?), but I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe a better approach: The transit probability is higher when the orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight. The probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (something else?), but I think that's the relative size of the star's disk from the planet's perspective.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a.

Wait no, maybe not exactly. Another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star as seen from Earth divided by the area of the planet's orbit as seen from Earth. Or something like that. Alternatively, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star is proportional to (R_star / a). Because a is the distance, so the chance is the ratio of the star's size to the distance. So higher R/a means higher probability.

Wait, I think the probability is (R_star / a) / (something like 1). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that the geometric probability for a transit is (R_star / a). Because the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with Earth's line of sight is proportional to that ratio.

So for each planet, the geometric probability (P) is proportional to (R_star / a). Since R_star is same for both, the planet with smaller a (a1 < a2) would have a higher probability.

So let's compute (R_star / a) for both.

a1 = ( ( (P1^2) * M1 ) / (4π²) )^(1/3 )

But perhaps a better way is to compute the ratio (R_star/a) for each planet.

Since R_star is same (R), let's compute (R / a1) and (R / a2).

We have a1 = ( ( (P1^2) * M1 ) )^(1/3 )

Express a1 in terms of a2.

We found earlier that a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

Therefore, (R/a1) = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 (R/a2).

So (R/a1) ≈ 1.65 times (R/a2).

Which means the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Wait, I think I might have gotten the ratio wrong.

Wait, the geometric transit probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a). So if a1 is smaller, then (R/a1) is larger than (R/a2).

So for Planet_1, (R/a1) is larger, so higher probability.

So in terms of P1's probability compared to P2's:

P1_prob / P2_prob = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = (a2/a1) = 1/(a1/a2).

We had a1/a2 ≈ 0.606, so a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So P1_prob = 1.65 * P2_prob.

So Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 because it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So, the correct answer should be C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the given parameters. Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (three times shorter than Planet_2) and orbits a star that is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star. Despite this, both stars have the same radius. 

The transit probability is proportional to the ratio \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the same for both stars, the key factor is the semi-major axis \( a \), which depends on the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_{\text{star}} \) via Kepler's third law:

\[
a \propto \left( P^2 \cdot M_{\text{star}} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left( \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \cdot 2M_2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left( P_2^2 \cdot M_2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Taking the ratio \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \cdot 2M_2}{P_2^2 \cdot M_2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 orbits closer to its star than Planet_2. Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. Specifically, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{Planet}_1}}{P_{\text{Planet}_2}} = \frac{R_{\text{star}} / a_1}{R_{\text{star}} / a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prefer observing Planet_1.
