Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh right, plx = 1/distance, so distance is inversely proportional to plx.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think I need to find the relationship between the number of stars (let's call it N) and the distance r. They gave N as proportional to 1/(plx)^5, so N ‚àù 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in would give N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that.

1/( (1/r)^5 ) equals r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but that's the number of stars as a function of distance. But the question is asking how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, I think that refers to the rate of change, like the derivative. So dN/dr would be the change in number per unit distance.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to 5r^4. But looking at the options, I don't see a 5r^4 option. The choices are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

Wait, maybe I
