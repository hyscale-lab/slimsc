Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and NMR spectra.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH stretch, maybe in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, that's a broad region. The other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But wait, since the question involves reacting with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is a dehydrohalogenation or maybe a substitution reaction. Hmm, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction? Or perhaps it's a cleavage of an ester?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters under acidic conditions. Oh wait, no, maybe it's for eliminating HX from an ester. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus is used for the hydrolysis of esters, converting them into carboxylic acids. Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Another thought: when you have an ester reacting with HBr (or HI) and red phosphorus, it's usually for the elimination of H
