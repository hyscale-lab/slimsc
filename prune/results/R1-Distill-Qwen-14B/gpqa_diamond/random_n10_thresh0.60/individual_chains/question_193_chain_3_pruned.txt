Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with a different power of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So, d = 1 / plx. 

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars varying with parallax. So if the number N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. 

Since I need to relate this to distance, I should express plx in terms of d. From d = 1/plx, that means plx = 1/d. So substituting that into the equation for N, it becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. 

Let me compute that exponent. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. Wait, (1/d)^5 is 1/(d^5), so 1 divided by that would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think it's about the number density or the number per unit distance
