Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the chemical formula from the given data. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The answer choices are labeled A to D.

Let me start by looking at each piece of data one by one and see what they tell me about the structure.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe there's an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid? But wait, a very broad peak could also be from something like an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe an -OH group is present. 

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might suggest conjugation or maybe an aromatic ring. Alternatively, it could be an amide group, but I don't think that's the case here because the options don't include N. Wait, but all the options have O, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone?

Wait, wait. If there's a peak at 1700, that's a strong carbonyl. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated, like in an aromatic ring (like a carbonyl adjacent to a benzene ring, perhaps an aromatic ketone or something). Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester with an aromatic group. Alternatively, it could be something else like an amide, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum: several peaks, and some correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has double bonds, probably. So maybe something like an ester with a double bond, or maybe a ketone with a double
