Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it's reacted with a set of reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I'll try to determine what the original compound is based on the molecular formula and NMR. Molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X (halogens) are zero. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe one ring, a couple of double bonds, and perhaps an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H). A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That seems like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet, but this is a triplet, so maybe it's coupled with something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aromatic proton, but that's less likely since aromatic protons are usually lower, around 6-8 ppm.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like a pair of doublets, which could be from a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like maybe two protons each on two equivalent aromatic rings. Wait, but each doublet is 2H, so maybe each is a pair of equivalent protons on a benzene ring. So like two aromatic rings, each with two protons as doublets. That suggests maybe two para-substituted phenyl groups or something.

6.27 (bs, 2H). A broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton or possibly a conjugated system. Or maybe an enol structure. But in the given data, it's a singlet, so the two protons are equivalent and not split by neighboring H's.

3.66 (d, 2H). A doublet, 2H. That could be a methylene group, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Like an OCH2 group or maybe part of an ester or ether. The doublet suggests that these two protons are next to another set of protons, perhaps a neighboring CH2 or something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzaldehyde group (the triplet at 9.72 ppm, but wait, aldehyde is usually a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Wait, maybe it's an enol tautomer or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents.

Wait, another approach: looking for a structure with two aromatic rings. Let me think about the options
