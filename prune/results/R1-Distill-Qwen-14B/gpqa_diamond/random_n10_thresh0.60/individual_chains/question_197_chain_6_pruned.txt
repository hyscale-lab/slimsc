Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Wait, right! They are used to hydrolyze nitriles to amines, but wait, maybe that's not it. Oh wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I think that when you have a nitrile reacting with HI and red phosphorus, it's a hydrolysis reaction that produces an amine. Or wait, wait – no, maybe that's when you have a nitrile reacting with something else. Alternatively, maybe it's about the elimination of a group. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me recall my notes. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Wait, no, wait. Actually, another reaction comes to mind. When a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it typically undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. So, the nitrile group (-CN) becomes a primary amine (-NH2). For example, R-CN + HI, red P → R-NH2 + other products.

Alternatively, wait, I think the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is more commonly used for the hydrolysis of alkyl chlorides or other halides. Oh wait, no, that's maybe for elimination reactions. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another angle: The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and HI
