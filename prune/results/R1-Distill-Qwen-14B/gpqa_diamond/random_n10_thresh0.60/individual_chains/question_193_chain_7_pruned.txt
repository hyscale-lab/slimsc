Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so like 1/plx^5. Wait, or is it plx^5 in the denominator? Yeah, yeah, 1/plx^5, so N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. So if plx is 1/r, then I can write r as 1/plx.

Now, substituting this into the given relation. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So substituting r = 1/plx, we have plx = 1/r. Let's see: 1/(plx)^5 equals r^5 because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1/(plx^5) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Am I thinking about this correctly? Let me double-check. Let me write the substitution step by step. 

Parallax plx = 1/r. So plx is inversely proportional to r. So when plx increases, r decreases, and vice versa.

Given that N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/r. So
