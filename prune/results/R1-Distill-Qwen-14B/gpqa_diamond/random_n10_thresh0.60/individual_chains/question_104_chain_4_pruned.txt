Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So, when a planet orbits a star, it makes the star wobble, and we can see that wobble as shifts in the spectral lines.

The question is about two planets, both with masses similar to Neptune. Their host stars have the same mass as the Sun, so each star is identical in mass. Each planet was found using the RV method. The key point is the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms.

Wait, what determines the size of the Doppler shift? I think the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Or maybe the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. Oh right, the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the size of the orbit.

I remember that the velocity semi-amplitude, K, is given by the formula K = (v*sin(i)) where v is the star's velocity. But more precisely, the formula involves the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. Let me think about the formula.

Oh yes, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (2Ï€)^(1/3) )) )

Wait,
