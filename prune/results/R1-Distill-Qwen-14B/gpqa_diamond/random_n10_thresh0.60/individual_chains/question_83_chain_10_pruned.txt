Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, okay, I remember that titration involves neutralization reactions, so maybe I should start by understanding the setup.

First, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, it's diluted by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³, right? Oh wait, because 20+20 is 40.

So the concentration after dilution would change. Let me think, the formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (M1*V1)/V2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. So for each of these points, I'll need to calculate the pH.

Let me start with the equivalence point because that might be simpler. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions and water.

But wait, how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point? Let me figure that out.

The moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So, 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles.

Since the reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of NaOH needed will also be 0.001.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, that's 25% of the way to the equivalence point. Wait, no, wait. Because the question is about 25% titration, which is 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. But I think I got ahead of myself. Let me clarify.

Wait, the titration is done with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point volume is 10 cm³, as I just calculated. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check the equivalence point. Let me recap: The
