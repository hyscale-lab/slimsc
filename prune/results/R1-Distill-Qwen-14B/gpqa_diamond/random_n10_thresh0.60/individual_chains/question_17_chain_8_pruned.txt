Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10.

The options are A to D, and I need to choose the right one. Hmm. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. A high K means the complex is more stable.

Wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So that’s the concentration of the complex, right? Let me think about how the complex dissociates. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. But in this case, the solution is the complex itself, so maybe it's already formed, and we're looking for the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

The formation constant K is given, which is K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). But I'm not sure if I should be using the K for the dissociation or the formation. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, so it's for the formation of the complex from the ions.

So, we have the complex CaEDTA^2− at 0.02 M. If it dissociates, it will release Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. But wait, the K is formation, which is for the reverse of dissociation. So the dissociation would have K_dissociation = 1/K_formation, right?

So for the dissociation: CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−. The K for this would be 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, if we assume that the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that it dissociates a little bit. Let me think about the expression for K_dissociation. Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[CaEDTA^2−] = 2e-11.

But wait, in pure solution, the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be zero. But considering the dissociation, let's say x is the concentration of Ca²+ that comes off. So,

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x
[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is very small, so x is very small compared to 0.02)

So plugging into Kd:

Kd = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

So x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13

Then x = sqrt(4e-13
