Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, stochiometric means the molar ratio is 1:1 between calcium and EDTA, right? So the complex is CaEDTA²⁻.

The given K value is KCa-EDTA = 5x10^10. I think this K is the formation constant, which tells us about the stability of the complex. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So the complex is really stable here, which means it won't dissociate much.

Wait, the formation constant, Kf, for a complex like CaEDTA²⁻ is given. The formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²−. The Kf expression would be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But wait, the problem gives me the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. So initially, [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M, and they're asking for [Ca²+]. 

But wait, since the complex doesn't dissociate much because K is so large, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be really low. Because even a tiny amount of dissociation would mean a tiny [Ca²+].

So using the formation constant equation, I can write:

Kf = [CaEDTA²−] / ([Ca
