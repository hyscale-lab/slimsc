Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I need to think through each step carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and figure out the products.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, 1. The NMR and IR data are given.

IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak which I think is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, product 1 is likely an epoxide or maybe a ketone? Wait, no, because KOH is a base and dehydrohalogenation typically forms alkenes, but wait, in this case, with two bromines on adjacent carbons (since it's 1,3-dibromo, but adamantane has a structure where 1 and 3 are on the same face?), maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to an alkene, but considering the IR, maybe it's an elimination forming a ketone? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide. When treated with strong base like KOH, especially in a high-temperature condition, it's likely undergoing an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. But the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more indicative of a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. Hmm, maybe that's from an epoxide opening? Wait, no, KOH wouldn't form an epoxide, that's more for epoxidation with peracids.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination. If there are two bromines, perhaps adjacent, the base could abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the positions 1 and 3 are two carbons apart. So, perhaps when treated with KOH, it undergoes two dehydrohalogenation steps, forming a diene? Wait, no, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a different carbon, so elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 2 and 3? No, that would be a conjugated diene, but I
