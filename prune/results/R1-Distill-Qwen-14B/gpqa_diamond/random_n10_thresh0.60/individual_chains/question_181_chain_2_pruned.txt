Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think through this.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. And we need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux band1 divided by flux band2.

Wait, I remember the Sun's energy production involves several steps. The proton-proton chain is the main one, right? And the pp-III branch is part of that. Oh right, the pp chain has multiple branches. The pp-I branch involves the fusion of two protons to form deuterium, then another proton fusing to make helium-3. The pp-II branch produces helium-4, but I'm not sure exactly how that works. The pp-III branch, I think, involves higher energy states or maybe different paths... Or wait, I might be confusing with the CNO cycle. No, CNO is a different process altogether, more dominant in heavier stars.

So, the pp-III branch probably produces different neutrino spectra. Neutrinos are produced during the fusion processes, especially when a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, which emits a neutrino. Oh, right, the dominant solar neutrino comes from the Beryllium-7 in the CNO cycle, but wait no, I'm mixing things. Let me get this straight.

The proton-proton chain's main neutrino sources are two: the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction and the dominant ppI reaction. The ppIII branch might contribute a third source of neutrinos. Wait, no, perhaps the pp-III branch isn't a separate source but a continuation. Maybe it's the branch where two helium-3 nuclei fuse to form carbon-4, but that's part of the main ppI process. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, I remember that the pp-III branch involves the capture of a helium-3 nucleus by a helium-3, producing carbon-6, which is radioactive and then decays into carbon-4 via the emission of a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, but that's the main
