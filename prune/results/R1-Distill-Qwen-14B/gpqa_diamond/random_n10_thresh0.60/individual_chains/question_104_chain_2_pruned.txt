Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift indicates the star is moving towards or away from us, which tells us about the planet's presence.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. They detected the shifts in spectral lines, and planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, while planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is the relation between the Doppler shift (which relates to the star's velocity) and the planet's orbital period. The RV method measures the star's velocity, and that velocity is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I believe.

The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/1) ) Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, another approach might be better.

I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. Since both stars have the same mass (similar to the Sun), perhaps the formula can be simplified.

Wait, Kepler's third law in the context of exoplanets is often written as P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) ) * a^3. Since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So P² ∝ a^3 / M_star.

But how does this relate to the RV method and the observed Doppler shift?

The RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is given by v = (2π a) / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. Since
