Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, the question says that two states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to figure out the energy difference that allows them to be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, how does this apply here?

So, each quantum state has a certain lifetime, which is like the uncertainty in time Δt. The energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime. A shorter lifetime means a larger energy uncertainty, right? Because if the state doesn't last very long, we can't know its energy very precisely.

The goal is to have the energy difference between E1 and E2 be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Otherwise, they might not be distinguishable. So the difference ΔE should be bigger than the uncertainty from each state.

Let me think about the formula again. The energy uncertainty ΔE for each state would be roughly ħ divided by the lifetime. So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime.

I think the reduced Planck constant ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes people use units where ħ is 6.582e-16 eV·s when dealing with electron volts. Oh right, because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So when working in eV, it's easier to use ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for each state, the energy uncertainty would be:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s ≈ 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. So the first state has a lifetime of 1e-9 s, making ΔE1 about 6.58e-7 eV. The second state has a longer lifetime of 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is around 6.58e-8 eV.

Now, the energy difference between E1
