Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question involves a series of reactions leading to compound E, which I need to identify from the given options. Let's break down the problem.

The reaction steps are as follows:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:
a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) IR spectra: A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, E at ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, which are various cyclic ketones.

First, I need to figure out what compound A is based on the information given. Let's start with hint a.

Hint a says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it produces 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone.

The product structure given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me visualize this structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The substituent at position 4 is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is a propene group where the double bond is between C2 and C3, with a methyl group on C2. So, the structure is a cyclopentane ring with two methyl groups at 1 and 2, and a substituent at 4 which is a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 group? Wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 4. The substituent at position 4 is propan-2-ylidene, which is a group like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? But wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part. No, wait, the ylid is the part that comes from the Wittig reagent. The ylid typically is something like Ph3P=CH-R. So when it reacts with an aldehyde or ketone, it forms an alkene.

So, if the product has a substituent at position 4 that is a propan-2-ylidene group, that suggests that A must have had a carbonyl group (since the Wittig reaction is between a carbonyl and an ylide to form an alkene). Therefore, compound A must be a cyclopentanone derivative.

Wait, let me think again. The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The substituent at position 4 is propan-2-ylidene, which would come from a carbonyl reacting with a Wittig reagent. So, perhaps the starting carbonyl was a cyclopentanone with substituents, and the Wittig reagent added a propan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out. Let's see, the product has a cyclopentane ring with methyl groups at 1 and 2. The substituent at 4 is a propenyl group, perhaps.

Wait, the product structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but as a substituent on the cyclopentane. Hmm, no. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is a group like CH2-C(CH3)= something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to
