Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is and what information I have to work with.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying numbers of hydrogens and oxygen atoms. I need to figure out which formula fits the data provided.

First, let's break down each piece of information given.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The peaks observed are a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹, and two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, I remember that FTIR is useful for identifying functional groups based on absorption peaks. The broad peak around 3000 is likely from O-H stretching. O-H can be in alcohols, phenols, or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the broadness might suggest hydrogen bonding, which is common in either phenols or carboxylic acids. Also, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak.

Then there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. A peak around 1700 is typical for either a ketone or an aldehyde, maybe an ester or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the other peak is at 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which might indicate a conjugated carbonyl group. Like in a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, such as an enone? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with substituents, like a conjugated ester or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 1650 might be from an aromatic C=C stretch. If the compound has an aromatic ring, that would fit with the NMR part, which mentions vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so that suggests either an alkene or an aromatic ring. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So there are hydrogens attached to a double bond.
