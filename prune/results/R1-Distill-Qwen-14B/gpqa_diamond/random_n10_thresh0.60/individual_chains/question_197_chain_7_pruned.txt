Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI usually mean some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a halogenation or something else. Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe it's for eliminating HX, like dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps it's a case of substituting a hydroxyl group with iodine.

But first, I need to figure out what compound X is by looking at the IR and NMR data.

Let's look at the IR data. IR peaks are given at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That might indicate an O-H stretch, like from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have O-H and C=O. Also, a peak around 1610 cm-1 could be from aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm-1 might be from another aromatic ring vibration or something else, maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR data: looking at the 1H NMR.

First, the peaks:
