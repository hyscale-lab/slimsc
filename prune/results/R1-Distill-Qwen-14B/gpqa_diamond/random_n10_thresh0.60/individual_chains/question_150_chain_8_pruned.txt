Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's think about the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. So, the degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula: Degree of Unsat = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1.

Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be five rings, or a combination of rings and double bonds. Probably a couple of rings and some double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) and a double bond (1), plus maybe another ring or another double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. Oh, that's a strong signal, maybe an aldehyde proton. Or maybe a carboxylic acid, but the next reagents might give a clue. But wait, the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually for diazotization, which happens with aromatic amines, especially in cold conditions (like 0-5°C). So if the compound has an amine group, perhaps it's a primary amine, maybe in an aromatic compound.

The other signals: 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). Those look like two sets of doublets, each integrating to two protons. That's typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Then there's 6.27 (bs, 2H) – a broad singlet for 2H. Broad could mean it's near an electronegative group, maybe an -OH group or something else. Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with some coupling, but not sure yet.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an oxygen nearby, like OCH2 or something similar.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. The aldehyde proton at 9.72 is probably part of that.

Wait, the initial compound has a formula of C8H9NO. So, if I think about it, maybe it's a benzaldehyde with some substituents. Let's see: benzaldehyde is C7H6O. But our formula is C8H9NO. So that's one more carbon, three more hydrogens, and a nitrogen and an oxygen. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenyl group attached to another structure. Like, perhaps, a secondary amine attached to a benzene ring, but also an aldehyde group somewhere else.

Wait, the reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: this is typically for diazotization. So the compound must have an aromatic amine, probably a primary amine. Diazotization occurs when you have a primary aromatic amine (
