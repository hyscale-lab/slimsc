Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh, and the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. So, I need to find the concentration of Ca²+ ions in this solution.

Wait, when EDTA complexes with a metal ion like Ca²+, the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. But wait, no, I think the formula for the complex is Ca-EDTA, which would be a 1:1 ratio. So the formation constant, K, is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

I think the formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Oh wait, but in this case, the solution contains the complex, so maybe I can think in terms of dissociation.

Wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I have 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2−. Then, this complex can dissociate into
