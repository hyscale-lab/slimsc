Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy of the collider when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I think I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Alright, let's break down the problem. First, what is the nucleus X? It's Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6 because the atomic number (protons) is 3 and neutrons are 3, so mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Wait, but in colliders, they usually deal with ions as fully stripped, meaning they have all electrons removed. So each Li-6 ion would be a ^6Li²+ ion, but I'm not sure if that matters for the calculation. I think for calculating the energy, I just need the mass of the ion.

So, the speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I need to find the energy of the ion. Since it's a relativistic problem, I should use the relativistic energy equations.

The total energy of a particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute γ.

Let me compute that. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 0.28. Therefore, γ is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, but that's a rough calculation. Let me get more precise. 1/0.28
