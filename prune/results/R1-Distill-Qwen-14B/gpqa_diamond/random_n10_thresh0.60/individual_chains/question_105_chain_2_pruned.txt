Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

So, the question is about a star that has some dark spots on one hemisphere, and how that affects the star's brightness as observed from Earth. The problem says that these spots can mimic the effect of an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. We need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots do.

First, let's understand what's given. The star has the same radius as the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature, Teff, is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so their temperature is 5000K. Only one hemisphere is spotted, so when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes.

So the brightness variations (the light curve) are due to the spots. When a spot is in view, it makes the star appear slightly dimmer because it's cooler than the rest of the star.

The goal is to find the radius (Rpl) of a planet that, when it transits the star, would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do. 

Hmm. So the spots' effect on the light curve is analogous to a planet blocking some light. But wait, spots are different because they are cooler, not blocking light but emitting less. When a planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip. Spots, being cooler, make the star's overall brightness dip as they rotate into view.

Wait, but in this case, the star's brightness variation is due to the spots. So when the spots are facing us, the star looks a bit dimmer. The same as if a planet were blocking part of the star, but maybe not exactly the same because the planet is a solid object blocking, while the spots are just emitting less.

Wait, actually, the star's total brightness (apparent magnitude) is affected by the spots. But when the spots come into view, their lower brightness makes the total flux decrease. So the change in flux is due to the spots' lower contribution.

Now, the question is, what planet radius would cause the same change in flux as the spots?

So first, let's calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The approach would be to compute the change in the star's total flux when the spots are
