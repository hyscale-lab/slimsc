Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should give me clues about its structure.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which probably indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H, but since we're dealing with organic compounds, O-H is more likely. The next peaks are at 1720 cm⁻¹ and 1610 cm⁻¹. The 1720 is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. But the 1610 cm⁻¹ might be a C=C stretch, as aromatic rings typically absorb around there. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's break them down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm usually points to an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton because those are also broad and around 10-12 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. That would align with the IR peak at 1720 if it's a carboxylic acid (though usually, the carbonyl for acids is around 1700 and might have a broad peak due to O-H). But the IR also has 1610, which could be the C=C in the ring.

Another signal at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical of para-substituted aromatic protons. So it's probably a para-substituted benzene ring. Let's say substituents at the para positions. So, structure-wise, maybe something like a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.

The next signals are 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something that's probably a CH2 group. Like maybe a ethyl group or a butyl. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is a CH2CH(CH3) or something similar. Wait, wait, let me think. The 1.4 doublet with 3H integrates to a methyl group attached to a CH2. So maybe a CH2CH2CH(CH3) something. The 2.9 m (1H) could be a CH group between two CH2 groups. Let me try to visualize.

Putting it all together: The aromatic ring has two substituents, maybe a carbonyl group and a substituent with an ethyl or butyl chain. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, so perhaps the compound is a benzene ring with a
