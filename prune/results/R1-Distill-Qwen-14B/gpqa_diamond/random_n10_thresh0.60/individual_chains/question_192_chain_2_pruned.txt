Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Okay, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, right? And the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with conductors and charges inside cavities, the concept of electrostatic shielding comes into play. Wait, but wait—that's for charges inside the conductor. In this case, the charge is inside a cavity, so maybe the shielding effect applies here differently.

Wait, no. The conductor itself is uncharged. So, when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the conductor remains neutral. But I think the charge induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor. Let me think: the cavity is inside the conductor, so the charge +q would induce a -q charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor was uncharged, that leaves the outer surface with zero net charge. Because the total induced charge on the inner surface is -q, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out? Wait, no, wait—no, the conductor's total charge is zero. So when you have +q inside the cavity, the inner surface will have -q, making the remaining conductor (the outer part) have +q to balance it? Wait, no, no. Wait, the conductor was initially neutral. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total zero. Or wait, no—wait, no. If the conductor is neutral, the net charge is zero. So, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) must have a charge of -q, induced by the +q inside. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight.

The conductor is neutral. When a charge +q is
