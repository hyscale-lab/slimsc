Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what a density matrix is.

A density matrix, ρ, is used to describe the state of a quantum system in a mixed state. It's a positive semi-definite matrix that must satisfy two main properties: trace equal to 1 and being Hermitian. Oh right, and for a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, meaning ρ² = ρ.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, wait, so each of these terms is a projector onto the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Let me write this out in matrix form to visualize it better.

I know that |0⟩ is represented as [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| would be the outer product, which is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| would have 1 in (2,2) position. So adding these two matrices gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. That's a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position of this state in qubit space? I'm a bit confused about how density matrices correspond to points in space. Oh, right, for a single qubit, the space is 2-dimensional, but when considering the Bloch sphere representation, any single qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere.

But wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states. Since this is a density matrix, which could represent a mixed state, I think the way it's mapped is different. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space with magnitude ≤1.

So let's expand that. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So the general form is:

ρ = (1/2) [ I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z ]

I is the identity matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So substituting in, we get:

ρ = (1/2) [ [[1,0],[0,1]] + r_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + r_y [[0,-i],[i,0]] + r_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

But wait, the given ρ is diagonal. Let me compute each term:

Our given ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Let's compare this to the general form.

The general ρ when expanded is:

(1/2) [ (1 + r_z) , r_x - i r_y ]
          [ r_x + i r_y, (1 - r_z) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute each component properly.

Wait, let me compute each term when I expand (I + r·σ)/2.

I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. 

r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. So:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ is:
[ [r_z, r_x - i r_y],
  [r_x + i r_y, -r_z] ]

So when we add I, we have:

I + r·σ = 
[[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
 [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]]

Then, multiplying by 1/2:

ρ = (1/2) [[1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y],
           [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z]]

So, our given ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Let me set these equal to each other.

So for the (1,1) element: (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

For the (2,2) element: (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 - r_z =1 → r_z=0. So that's consistent.

Now, the (1,2) element in our given ρ is 0. In the general form, it's (r_x - i r_y)/2. So (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0.

That implies r_x - i r_y =0. Let me write that as two real equations. The real part is r_x =0, and the imaginary part is -r_y =0 → r_y=0. So both r_x and r_y are zero.

So the Bloch vector r is [0,0, r_z] = [0,0,0]. Because r_z is zero, as we found earlier.

Wait, but let's make sure. So in the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state when r is zero. So the state is at the origin, which would be the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused because sometimes the density matrix for a completely mixed state is (I/2), which is exactly what this is. So the corresponding Bloch vector is zero, so r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the general form of \( \rho \) becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\
r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \), we analyze each element:

1. From the (1,1) element: \( \frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies r_z = 0 \).
2. From the (2,2) element: \( \frac{1 - r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \implies r_z = 0 \), consistent with the above.
3. From the (1,2) element: \( \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \implies r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \).

Thus, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is at the origin in the Bloch sphere representation.

From the options provided:
- **A)** \( r = (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as \( r_x = 1 \) and \( r_y = 1 \) do not match.
- **B)** \( r = (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as \( r_z = 1 \) does not match.
- **C)** \( r = (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as derived above.
- **D)** \( r = (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as none of the components match.

The correct answer is **C**, \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
