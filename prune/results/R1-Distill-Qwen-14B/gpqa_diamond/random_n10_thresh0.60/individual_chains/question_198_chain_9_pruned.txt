Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt ions and thiocyanate complexes. Hmm, I remember stability constants are involved. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The solution has Co²+ ions and SCN⁻. The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants are for the formation of complexes. The general formula for each complex would be Co(SCN)_n²−n, right? So βn is the formation constant for each step. So β1 is for Co(SCN)²+ → Co²+ + SCN⁻. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the overall complex.

Wait, no, the stability constant β is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So for each n, βn is the equilibrium constant for Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)_n²−(n−2). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think: Co²+ can form complexes with SCN⁻. The first complex is [Co(SCN)]²+, which would have charge +2-1= +1? Wait, no: Co²+ plus one SCN⁻ would make [Co(SCN)]²+? No, because SCN⁻ is -1, so Co²+ plus one SCN⁻ would make [Co(SCN)]^+? Or wait, maybe the complex [Co(SCN)]²+ has the same charge as Co²+ plus the sum of the SCN⁻ charges. Hmm, maybe I should think of the complexes as [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

So, for each n, the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}. So, the first complex (n=1) is [Co(SCN)]^+ (since 2−1=1). The second (n=2) would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Third, [Co(SCN)_3]^-1. Fourth, [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

But wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the nth complex.
