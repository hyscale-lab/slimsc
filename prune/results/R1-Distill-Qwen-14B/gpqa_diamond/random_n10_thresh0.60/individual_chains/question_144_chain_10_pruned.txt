Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance depends on their lifetime and speed. 

The given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Wait, the width—oh right, that's the decay width, which relates to the particle's lifetime. 

I think the first step is to find the lifetime of the meson. I remember the uncertainty principle, which says that the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by τ ≈ ħ/Γ. Oh wait, but I should make sure about the exact formula. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ is ħ divided by Γ. Yeah, that sounds right.

But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and I need to handle the units properly. I know that ħ (the reduced Planck constant) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me write that down: ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Because 1 GeV = 1000 MeV, right. So converting Γ_X to GeV, Γ = 0.32 GeV.

Now, calculating τ: τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. The GeV units cancel out, so τ ≈ 6.582e-25 / 0.32. Let's compute that. 

Hmm, 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let's see, 0.32 times 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is a little more than that. 6.582 /0.32 is 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 /0.32 * 1e-25 s. Let me compute 6.582 divided by 0.32. So 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, that's 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, is that correct? Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875e-25? Wait, no, wait. Let me do the division step by step.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32. Let me write it as 6.582 / 0.32 multiplied by 1e-25. 6.
