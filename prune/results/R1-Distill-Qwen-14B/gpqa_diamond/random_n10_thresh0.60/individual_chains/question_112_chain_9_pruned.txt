Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator. Since the state is given as proportional, I think that means I need to normalize it first. So first step, find the normalization factor.

Wait, right. The normalization condition is that the sum of the probabilities (the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients) should equal 1. So the state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, with coefficients (1+i) and (2 - i). Let me calculate the squared magnitudes.

The coefficient for |up> is (1 + i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) is 1 +1=2. Similarly, the coefficient for |down> is (2 -i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7, so the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the problem asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because the state is two-dimensional (spin up and down). So the operator A has elements:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Because when i≠j, Aij is ħ/2, and when i=j, it's 0. So this is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

I think this operator is the Pauli X operator scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and here each element is ħ/2 times that.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually represented as:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So this operator A is (ħ/2) * σx. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σx, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. 

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x> states. These are the eigenstates of the σx operator. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to σx, perhaps I can find the expectation value of A directly without diagonalizing it. Wait, but the question isn't just about the average; it's about the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. So maybe I should find the eigenstates of A and then compute the expansion coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
