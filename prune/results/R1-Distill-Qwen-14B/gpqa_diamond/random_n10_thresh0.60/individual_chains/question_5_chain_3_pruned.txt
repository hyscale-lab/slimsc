Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the operator is P, and it's along a direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. We're given the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operators for a spin-½ particle are usually represented by these Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

So, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. That means the direction can be described using spherical coordinates, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle phi (φ) is zero. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, phi is the azimuthal angle, which is zero here since it's in x-z.

Wait, but the operator is given as a vector operator, so each component is P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator along direction n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the direction's respective axis. So the operator P is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the eigenvector equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, right? So we need to solve for the eigenvector of (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) with eigenvalue ħ/2.

Let me write down the matrices for each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, the operator along n is:
P = (n_x) * P_x + (n_z) * P_z.

Substituting the matrices:

P = (n_x * ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]]) + (n_z * ħ/2 [[1,0],[0,-1]])

Factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let me compute that. The first term is (n_x * ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] which is [[0, n_x ħ/2], [n_x ħ/2, 0]]. The second term is (n_z * ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] which is [[n_z ħ/2, 0], [0, -n_z ħ/2 ]]. So adding them together:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, no. Let me see, for the first element: n_z * (ħ/2) [ [1,0], ... ] so [n_z * (ħ/2), 0], but wait, no, I think I might have messed up. Let me write each element:

- The (1,1) element is (n_z * ħ/2) * 1 + (n_x * ħ/2 ) * 0 = (n_z ħ/2)
- (1,2): (n_x ħ/2) * 1 = n_x ħ/2
- (2,1): same as (1,2), so n_x ħ/2
- (2,2): (n_z ħ/2) * (-1) + 0 = -n_z ħ/2

So yes, P is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait no, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Wait, but since P is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z), which is scaled by ħ/2, the actual equation is:

(n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, let me see: P is the operator in the direction n, which is [n_x, 0, n_z] (since y-component is zero). So P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. So the operator P is a 2x2 matrix as we wrote earlier. So the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

But wait, P is ((n_x) P_x + (n_z) P_z). So substituting, the matrix becomes (ħ/
