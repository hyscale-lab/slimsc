Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium, right? The isotopes of lithium. So, lithium typically has 3 protons because the atomic number is 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 +3 =6, so it's Li-6. Oh wait, no, wait: wait, protons are 3, neutrons 3, so mass number is 6. So the nucleus is lithium-6.

So the problem is to calculate the energy of the RHIC when the speed of each nucleus is 0.96c. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

I remember that the energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula: E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, I should probably write down the equations to make sure.

So first, find gamma for v = 0.96c. Let's compute that.

v = 0.96c. So beta is 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(
