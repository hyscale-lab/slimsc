Okay, I'm trying to figure out which of these theories doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm. So, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems, so physicists use methods like cutoff regularization or dimensional regularization to make the math work out.

Looking at the options:

Option A is Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, incorporating gravity and quantum mechanics. Wait, string theories are supposed to be finite, right? Because they don't have the same divergences as other quantum field theories. They work with strings vibrating at different frequencies instead of point particles, so maybe they don't need regularization. 

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and is known to be asymptotically free. But because of this, when you calculate loop diagrams, especially at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling becomes weak, making perturbative methods valid. However, I'm not sure if QCD requires regularization. Wait, I think QCD does use regularization methods, like lattice regularization or others, because even though it's asymptotically free, the calculations can still have divergences that need handling.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the theory of electromagnetism. QED is a well-known case where regularization is necessary. For example, when calculating the electron self-energy or the Lamb shift, you get divergent integrals. These are handled using regularization techniques, so QED definitely requires it.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait, classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics, so they don't have the same issues with divergences that quantum theories do. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you can have point charges leading to infinities, but in classical E&M, you might just accept that as part of the model, or use distributions like the Dirac delta function. But do you need regularization in the same sense as quantum field theories? I don't think so. Regularization is a quantum field theory tool to make sense of divergent integrals. So classical theories don't require it.

So the question is asking which theory never requires regularization. If Superstring Theory is finite, then it wouldn't need regularization. If that's the case, then option A might be the answer. Alternatively, if classical E&M never needs regularization because it's not a quantum theory,
