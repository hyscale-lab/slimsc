Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants from my studies; they tell us about the stability of a complex ion. The higher the beta value, the more stable the complex is. 

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ or maybe the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion. Wait, the blue one refers to the tetrahedral complex, right? Or maybe the octahedral? Not too sure, but I think the dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. 

Wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species. So I need to find the fraction of Co that's in the form Co(SCN)_2^2+ (or whatever the blue complex is), considering all possible complexes and the free ions.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and free ion using the stability constants. So the species present are Co^2+, Co(SCN)_1^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^3+, and Co(SCN)_4^4+. Wait, no, because the beta values go up to 4, which would be four SCN- ions. Wait, no, wait: the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So βn is for the complex with n ligands, right? So:

- β1 is for Co(SCN)^(2+?), wait, maybe the complex is [Co(SCN)]^2+ but I'm not quite sure about the charge. Let me think: Co^2+ with SCN^- as ligands. Each SCN- is -, so for each SCN added, the charge would go down by 1. So Co^2+ plus one SCN^- would be Co(SCN)^+. So the charge would be 2+ -1 = 1+.

Wait, no, because SCN^- is a -1 charge. If Co^2+ has one SCN, that's Co(SCN)^+, which is 2+ plus (-
