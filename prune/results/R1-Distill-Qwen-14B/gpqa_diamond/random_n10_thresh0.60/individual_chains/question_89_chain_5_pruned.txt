Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene. But wait, this is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the bromines are not on adjacent carbons. Oh, right! So if it's 1,3-dibromo, when KOH is added, each Br is on a different carbon, but they might undergo debromination. Wait, noâ€”adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so each Br is on a bridgehead. When heated with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? Or perhaps elimination to form allene?

Wait, another thought: heating with KOH could lead to the formation of an epoxide if the starting material is a dihalide. Oh wait, no, because that's more like the formation of an epoxide from a dihalide with a base, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form an alkyne? Let me think.

1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When KOH is used in an elimination reaction, each Br would be removed. So each dehydrohalogenation would form a double bond, but wait, with two adjacent Brs, perhaps it forms an alkyne
