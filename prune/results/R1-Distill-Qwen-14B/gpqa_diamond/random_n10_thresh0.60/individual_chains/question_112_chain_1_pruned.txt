Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question involves an electron state and measuring probabilities for a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation is given, and I need to find the probabilities and the average value.

Wait, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So first, I need to find the actual state, not just proportional. That means I should normalize it.

So, let me write the state:

|alpha> = a (1+i)|up> + a (2-i)|down>

Wait, no. Wait, the question says it's proportional to that. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but I need to normalize it. So I should compute the normalization constant.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So compute the inner product:

( (1-i) (2+i) ) + ( (2+i)(1-i) ) ?

Wait, no. Let me think.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The inner product is <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2.

Wait, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So the inner product is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2? Wait, (1+i)(1-i) is
