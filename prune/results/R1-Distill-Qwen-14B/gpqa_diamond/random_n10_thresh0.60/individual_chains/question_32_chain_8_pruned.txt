Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. Lithium usually has 3 protons because it's Li-7, but if it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number would be 7 (since 3 protons +3 neutrons =6? Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, Li normally has 3 protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, then it's Li-6? Or Li-7? Because 3 protons and 4 neutrons would make Li-7. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So the number of protons is Li's atomic number, which is 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) = 6. So X is Li-6. Okay.

So the nucleus is Li-6. I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed v is 0.96c. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so I think the energy here refers to the kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. Relativistic energy equations... I remember that when dealing with speeds close to c, we use the relativistic formulas. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. But wait, is the problem asking for the total energy or just the kinetic energy?

The question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed...". I think RHIC's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy per particle. Or perhaps the total energy. I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem specifies "the energy of the RHIC" so that the speed is 0.96c. RHIC is a collider, so it's about the energy each beam has. So each ion is accelerated to a certain energy. So in this case, we need to find the energy per ion. Since the speed is given, we can calculate the energy based on relativistic equations.

So, the formula for the total energy E is gamma * m0 cÂ², where m0 is the rest mass
