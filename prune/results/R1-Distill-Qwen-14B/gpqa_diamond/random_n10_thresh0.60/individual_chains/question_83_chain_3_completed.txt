Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should form acetate ions and water. 

The problem says we diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each step.

First, let me calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³, making the total 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's compute that: 0.05 * 20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, during titration, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So when we reach 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. 

Wait, how much is 25% titration in terms of moles? The volume of NaOH would be 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. Let me think: the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) → 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. 

The equivalence point would require 0.001 mol of NaOH because the reaction is 1:1. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol of NaOH. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration → 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. 

At 25% titration, I've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So the total solution volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 2.5 cm³ (NaOH) = 42.5 cm³. 

Now, let's find the concentrations at this point. The moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001 mol. We've neutralized 25% of it, which is 0.00025 mol. So remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol. 

But wait, the total volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.0176 M, and [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.00588 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). 

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is about 4.73 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733). 

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.00588 / 0.0176). Let me compute the ratio: 0.00588 / 0.0176 ≈ 0.334. Log(0.334) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Hmm, so around 4.25. Looking at the options, option D says pH 4.57 for the first part, which is higher. Option A has 4.26, which is close to my calculation. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck. Moles after 25%: I think I correctly calculated the remaining acid and acetate. 

Wait another thing, when I added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. So [CH3COOH] is 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L = 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. Ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.73 -0.477 ≈4.253. That's approximately 4.25, which is close to option A's first value, 4.26. 

But wait, wait. Let me calculate the exact pH. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach is correct, but maybe I should consider more precise calculations. Let me compute the ratio more accurately.

0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.00588235... and 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.0176470588. So the ratio is (0.00588235)/(0.0176470588) = 0.333333333... exactly 1/3. 

So log(1/3) is exactly log(0.3333) ≈ -0.4771. 

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.4771) = 4.2529. So approximately 4.25, which rounds to 4.25, but in the options, A says 4.26. Close enough. 

Now, for the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So at equivalence, the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it should hydrolyze in water to make the solution basic. 

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will be 0.001 mol, as calculated before. The volume of NaOH needed is 10 cm³ (since 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³). So the total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ (0.05 L).

The concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. 

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10. 

Now, using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. Since Kb is very small, x will be small, so we can approximate [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 M.

So Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. 

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M. pOH = -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute log(3.288e-6). 

log(3.288) is about 0.5168, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832. pH is 14 -5.4832 =8.5168, approximately 8.52. 

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26; 8.52. So the pH at 25% is ~4.25 (option A's first number is 4.26), and equivalence is 8.52. So option A seems correct. 

Wait, but wait. Let me verify the calculations again. Because sometimes I might have missed a step.

Another approach for the equivalence point: since the solution is a sodium acetate solution, the pH can be found using the formula for the hydrolysis of the salt. The acetate ion is a weak base. So the pH is determined by the Kb.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. 

The concentration is 0.02 M. Kb = 5.405e-10. 

So, the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO^-] ≈ x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x is very small. 

x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. 

So [OH^-] =3.288e-6 → pOH= -log(3.288e-6) 

Calculating that: log(3.288)= 0.5168 → log(3.288e-6)= 0.5168-6= -5.4832 → pOH=5.4832 → pH=14-5.4832=8.5168, which is approximately 8.52. So yes, at equivalence point, pH is about 8.52.

So the values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52. Looking back at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but what's the other option? Let me look again. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. That seems way off for the equivalence point. Option B is lower pH, which is unlikely for equivalence since it's a weak acid. So I think option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, followed by titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution
The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. The new concentration is calculated as:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{(0.05 \, \text{M} \times 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3)}{40.00 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Moles of acetic acid and equivalence point
The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.0400 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At the equivalence point, 0.001 mol of NaOH reacts completely with 0.001 mol of acetic acid to form 0.001 mol of acetate ions. The total volume at equivalence is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.0500 \, \text{L}} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 3: pH at equivalence point
At the equivalence point, the solution contains only acetate ions, which hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Assuming \( [OH^-] = x \), and \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] \approx 0.020 \, \text{M} \) (since \( x \) is small):

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.020} \implies x^2 = K_b \times 0.020 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \times 0.020 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Step 4: pH at 25% titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.0176}\right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.00588}{0.0176} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately 8.52. Comparing these values with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
