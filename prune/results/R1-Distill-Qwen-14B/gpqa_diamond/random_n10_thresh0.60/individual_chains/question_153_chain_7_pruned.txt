Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. 

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and the major products for each. The options are given as options A to D, each with different possible products.

Starting with part (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a diester, which is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor here.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate has a structure where the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon. Wait, the structure is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is between C2 and C3, right? So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no. Wait, I think I should draw it. The formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. But here, it's the methyl ester of 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group attached where? Let me think. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So, the three positions are 1, 2, 3. The first carbon is the CH2, second is CH, third is COOCH3. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acry
