Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix describes the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. But wait, what's the geometrical position? I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation of qubits.

The given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write this out in matrix form. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding those gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplied by 1/2, so ρ is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

I recall that for a single qubit state, the density matrix can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z) such that the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can express ρ in terms of I and the Pauli matrices, I can find r.

Let me write it out. The identity matrix I is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]] multiplied by 2 gives the identity I. Oh wait, no, the identity matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So ρ is (I + 0)/2 because comparing to (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2, the x, y, z components must all be zero. Because in ρ, there's no σx, σy, or σz terms. So the Bloch vector r has x=0, y=0, z=0. So the point is at the origin?

Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, what's the Bloch sphere representation for a completely mixed state? Oh right, when the qubit is in a completely mixed state, the density matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is what ρ is. And the Bloch vector for a completely mixed state is at the origin (0,0,0), because it's equally likely to be in |0> or |1>, so no direction in the Bloch sphere.

So looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which must be the correct answer. Let me double-check the options. Option C is indeed (0,0,0), so that's the one.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is 

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For single-qubit states, the density matrix can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \mathbf{I} \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \( \rho \), it is evident that there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)), meaning the components \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), and \( z = 0 \). This corresponds to the Bloch vector being at the origin, \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

This state represents a completely mixed state, which is consistent with the Bloch vector being at the origin. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 0) \)**  
**B) \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 1) \)**  
**C) \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \)**  
**D) \( \mathbf{r} = (1, 1, 1) \)**  

The correct answer is **C**, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Answer: C
