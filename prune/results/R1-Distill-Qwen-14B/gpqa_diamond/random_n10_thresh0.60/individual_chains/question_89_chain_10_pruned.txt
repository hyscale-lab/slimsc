Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. When heated with excess KOH, it forms product 1. The product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), another between 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which probably indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone.

So, what happens when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH? I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction—probably a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Oh, but wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the positions are adjacent in a ring structure? Or perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, no. Let me think. KOH in such conditions might cause an elimination, but if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's not adjacent. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But substitution would require a good leaving group, and with two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination.

But the product's IR shows a carbonyl. That suggests it's an epoxide or a ketone. Wait, no. Wait, 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl (C=O). Maybe it's a ketone. But how?

Another possibility is that the reaction forms an epoxide, but that's more about an oxygen connecting two adjacent carbons. But the IR for an epoxide's O isn't usually that high. Or maybe it's a diol? No, because the IR would show O-H stretching, which isn't mentioned.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or some kind of ring-opening. Or maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group via elimination of HBr twice.

Wait, let's think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons in a way that when KOH is used, it could lead to the formation of a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening. For example, if the adamantane structure has a bridge, and the bromines are on bridgehead carbons. Then, elimination could lead to a bridge opening, forming a ketone.

Wait, another thought: when a dihalide reacts with KOH, sometimes it can form an oxide. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces the formation of an oxide, which then could rearrange.

Alternatively, I remember that when two adjacent dihalides undergo dehydrohalogenation, they form an alkene. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are not adjacent, so elimination would not form a double bond between 1 and 3. Unless the structure allows for some kind of ring opening.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but with two bromides. KOH would substitute both, but that would give a diol, right? But the IR doesn't mention O-H, so maybe it's not a diol.

Wait, the NMR of product 1: the peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests something like an OCH₂ group. Maybe an epoxide, but then the coupling would be different. Alternatively, maybe a ketone. Wait, no, a ketone wouldn't have protons. Oh, wait, maybe the product is a ketone and an ep
