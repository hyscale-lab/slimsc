Okay, so I have this question about quantum mechanics, specifically about wave functions and probabilities. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question says we have many identical systems, each with a particle that can move along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1.

Wait, so the wave function is a complex function. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But when they measure the position of the particles, they only find them between x=1 and x=3. That means the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero, right? So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So if the probability is zero outside x=1 and x=3, then the wave function must be zero in those regions. But looking at the given wave function, it's a function of x, but it's a fixed function. Oh wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the given expression is valid for x between 1 and 3, and zero outside.

Wait, but the wave function they've given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, which suggests that it's a complex function. But for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of the
