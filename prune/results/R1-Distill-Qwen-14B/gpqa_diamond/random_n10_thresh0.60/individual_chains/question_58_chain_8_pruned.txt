Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about each of the options.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when dealing with high energies. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, which aren't physically meaningful. So, regularization helps make those calculations finite and manageable.

First, let me list out the options again: A is Superstring Theory, B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D is Classical Electrodynamics.

I know that QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. It's a quantum field theory that has been very successful. I remember that QED does have issues with divergences, especially in loop calculations. So they must use regularization techniques like introducing a cutoff or using dimensional regularization. So QED does require regularization. That would eliminate option C from the answer, since the question is about which doesn't require it.

QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I think QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling constant becomes small, and perturbation theory works well. But wait, does QCD require regularization? Well, since it's a non-Abelian gauge theory, calculations do lead to divergences. So yes, regularization is used in QCD as well. So option B isn't the answer.

Superstring Theory is an attempt to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity, by describing particles as vibrations of tiny strings. String theories are different because they are background-dependent and, importantly, they have a mechanism called "t Hooft's finiteness" in some formulations. Wait, I think that string theories naturally avoid some of the divergences that plague quantum field theories. Because in string theory, instead of point particles, you have strings, and the perturbative expansion is in terms of different orders of string interactions. These interactions don't lead to the same types of divergences because the structure of the theory is different. So perhaps string theories don't require regularization. Or do they? Hmm, maybe not. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But I remember that in some cases, string theories can avoid certain infinities, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Wait, what about Classical Elect
