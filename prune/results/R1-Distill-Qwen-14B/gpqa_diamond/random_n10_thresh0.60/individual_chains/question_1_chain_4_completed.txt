Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle at the same time. The more precisely you know the energy, the less you know about the lifetime, or vice versa.

The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or maybe a more commonly used version is ΔE * τ ≈ ħ, where τ is the lifetime. Because I've heard that the product of the energy uncertainty and the lifetime gives something like Planck's constant over 2π.

Wait, the exact formula I'm a bit fuzzy on, but I think it's ΔE * τ ≈ ħ. ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But since we're dealing with eV here, I should probably convert that.

Let me think about the units. 1 eV is 1.602176634 × 10^-19 joules. So to convert from joules to eV, you divide by that number.

So if I have ΔE in eV and τ in seconds, I can set up the equation ΔE * τ ≈ ħ (in J·s) divided by eV to eV conversion.

Wait, let me compute ħ in eV·s terms. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, then ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) = approx (1.0545718e-34) / (1.602e-19) eV·s.

Calculating that: 1.0545718e-34 divided by 1.602e-19 is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So the uncertainty principle would be ΔE * τ ≈ ħ. So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ.

Wait, but in this problem, each state has a lifetime. Wait, no, the question says the two states have lifetimes of 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. So which one's lifetime do I use for the energy uncertainty? Or wait, does each state's lifetime relate to its own energy uncertainty?

Wait, I think each state has its own lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ/(τ). So for E1, the uncertainty is ħ/(1e-9 s), and for E2, it's ħ/(1e-8 s).

Wait, but no, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in each energy to be distinguishable.

Alternatively, to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. But the uncertainty in each state's energy is determined by their respective lifetimes.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties, or perhaps just greater than the individual uncertainties. I'm a bit confused here.

Let me reassess. Each state has its own energy. The lifetime of a state relates to how precisely we can know its energy. A longer lifetime implies a smaller energy uncertainty because ΔE = ħ/τ. So if a state has a longer lifetime (like 1e-8 s), its ΔE is smaller.

Wait, so for E1, τ=1e-9 s, so ΔE1 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV. Similarly, for E2, τ=1e-8 s, ΔE2 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the math again. Because 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-9 is 6.582e-7, yes. And 6.582e-16 divided by 1e-8 is 6.582e-8, correct.

So if we have two energy levels, E1 and E2, each with their own uncertainties ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties to resolve them. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the energies might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

So the minimum ΔE would be when E2 - E1 > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let me compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

ΔE1 = 6.582e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.582e-8 eV. So adding them gives approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Wait, 6.582e-7 is 0.6582e-6, and 6.582e-8 is 0.06582e-6. So adding together gives 0.724e-6 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be more than 7.24e-7 eV for them to be clearly resolved.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A) 1e-9 eV → 1e-9 is way smaller than 1e-7, so no.
B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.
C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 7.24e-7. So yes, that's way larger.
D) 1e-8 eV → 1e-8 is smaller than 1e-7, so no.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because I'm getting that the required ΔE is about 7e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would be resolvable.

Looking at the options, the option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is way larger than 7.24e-7. So that's good. Option D is 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7, so not enough.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the ΔE for each state.

Wait, perhaps I got the calculation wrong. Let me recompute ΔE for each state.

For E1, τ1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / 1e-9 s = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, E2 has τ2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So the sum is 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.24e-7 eV.

So to resolve the two, the energy difference ΔE must be at least on the order of 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than that. So it's sufficient. The other options are either too small or just too small.

Wait, but option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01 times 1e-6 eV, which is smaller than 7.24e-7. So it's not sufficient.

So the correct option would be C, 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 10^-4 eV. That's 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV. So that's way bigger than 7.24e-7 eV.

So the answer would be option C.


To distinguish between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in their energies, which are determined by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: 

\[
\Delta E \cdot \tau \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \). For each state, the energy uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1}, \quad \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2}.
\]

Given the lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

The total uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must satisfy:

\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_{\text{total}} = 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is also smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it provides an energy difference large enough to distinguish the two states.
