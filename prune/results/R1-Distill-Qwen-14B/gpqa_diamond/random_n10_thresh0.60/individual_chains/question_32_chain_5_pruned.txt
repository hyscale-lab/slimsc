Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium. Wait, lithium typically has an atomic number of 3, meaning 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

Next, I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is related to its velocity. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high (close to the speed of light), I'll need to use relativistic equations. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula for total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

Gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, calculated as 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So v is 0.96c. Let me plug that into the formula. 

So v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 * c². Let me calculate (0.96)^2. 0.96 times 0.96 is 0.9216. So v squared is 0.9216 c squared. 

Now, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So the square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus X (Li-6) is needed. The rest mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c², roughly. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me calculate that.

3 protons: 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV. 3 neutrons: 3 * 939 = 2817 MeV. So total rest mass energy is 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Wait, but wait. I remember that the mass of the nucleus is a bit less than the sum because of binding energy, but since the problem asks for the energy of the collider, which would be the total relativistic energy of the nucleus, I think I should use the actual rest mass. Hmm, but perhaps I should check the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the mass of the entire nucleus. Let me think. The
