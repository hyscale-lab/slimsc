Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the direction is in the x-z plane, which probably means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, maybe. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, because it's in x-z, so φ is zero? Or maybe φ is 90 degrees, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so it could have any angle in that plane, meaning φ is 0 or 180 degrees, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to think in terms of spherical coordinates where the direction is given by θ and φ, but since the direction is in x-z plane, φ is 0. Hmm.

But wait, the actual operator is along the direction n, so the operator should be something like P · n, right? Since P is a vector operator, and the operator we're considering is along n, so the operator would be P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

The given components are P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P_n would be (ħ/2)(n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Because n is in x-z plane, so n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). Also, since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator is (ħ/2) (n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>

So, substituting P_n:

(ħ/2) [n_x [[0 1],[1 0]] + n_z [[1 0],[0 -1]] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[n_x [[0 1],[1 0]] + n_z [[1 0],[0 -1]] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

Which can be written as:

[ [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] ] |ψ> = |ψ>

Let me represent
