Alright, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First off, I remember that parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as we orbit the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax (plx), so distance d = 1/plx. Wait, right, because parallax plx is in arcseconds and d is in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of, say, 1 arcsec, it's 1 parsec away. And if plx is 0.5, then it's 2 parsecs away.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So they want to know how the number of stars, say N, depends on plx. The options are various power laws: 1/plx^4, squared, linear, cubed.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the physical density of stars in space is constant. So the number of stars should depend on the volume of space we're looking at. But wait, I'm talking about the number of stars per unit parallax. So maybe I should think in terms of how the volume changes with distance, which relates to parallax.

Let me think about the volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Since distance d is 1/plx, then r is proportional to 1/plx. So substituting, volume V is proportional to (1/plx)^3, because r^3 is (1/plx)^3.

So the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd would be the volume element (4πr² dr) multiplied by the number density of stars, which is uniform. Since number density n is constant, N is proportional to 4πr² dr × n. But wait, in this case, we're looking for the number per unit range of plx, so maybe I should express everything in terms of plx.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's make the substitution. The volume element for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. But since dr is a change in distance, and we want a change in parallax, let's see how dr relates to d(plx).

plx = 1/d → d = 1/pl
