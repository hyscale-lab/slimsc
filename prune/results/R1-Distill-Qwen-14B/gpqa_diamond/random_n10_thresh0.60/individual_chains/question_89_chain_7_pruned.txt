Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, giving a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I'll try to break down each reaction and see what's happening.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two Br atoms at specific positions. Heating with excess KOH—I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with KOH, they undergo elimination, forming alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the Br atoms are on carbons 1 and 3. Are they adjacent? No, because adamantane's structure is such that 1 and 3 are not next to each other. So maybe it's a 1,3-dihalide, which upon elimination would form something else.

Wait, wait. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh, wait, when dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo, vicinal) react with KOH, they eliminate to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is not vicinal, like 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the KOH would not eliminate but instead do an SN2 reaction? But adamantane is a very bulky molecule, so SN2 is probably not feasible for each Br. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation because KOH is a strong base. Wait, but if the Brs are on non-adjacent carbons, elimination might not form a double bond. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination, but that's for cyclic diesters. Not sure.

Wait, then looking at the product's data. The 1H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's around where you might see an -OCH2- group, maybe
