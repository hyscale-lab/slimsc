Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find their energy difference so they can be clearly resolved.

Hmm, wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle relating energy and time. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I think the exact form might be ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2, where τ is the lifetime. Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the time here is the uncertainty in the lifetime, which relates to how precisely we can measure the energy.

So the idea is that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (τ). The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy is known, so the smaller the ΔE. Oh wait, but in this question, we have two states with different lifetimes. Wait, no, the question is about the energy difference between the two states, not the uncertainty in each state's energy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says the two states have energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are τ1 and τ2, which are 1e-9 s and 1e-8 s. We need to find the energy difference ΔE=E2-E1 such that they can be clearly distinguished.

Wait, but how does the lifetime affect the energy difference needed for them to be resolved? Oh, I think I remember something about the natural linewidth in spectroscopy
