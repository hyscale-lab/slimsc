Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 

Next, there's something about the product of a keto acid reacting with X containing 2 oxygen atoms. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog. Hmm, I think that might give a clue about what X is.

First, let me break down each part.

1. **Reaction between X and Y:**
   X reacts violently with Y. I'm thinking maybe it's a metal reacting with an acid. For example, metals like sodium or potassium reacting with water. Wait, but Y is a liquid. If Y is water, then X could be a metal that reacts violently with water. Like potassium or sodium. They react exothermically, producing hydrogen gas.

2. **Gas W:**
   The gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Hydrogen, but that's just one proton and one neutron (if it's deuterium, but that's less common). Wait, maybe it's another gas. What about helium? No, that's two protons and two neutrons (if it's helium-4). Or perhaps another molecule. Wait, another option: CO2? No, that's 22 neutrons and 22 protons? No, wait. Wait, maybe W is CO2, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, think about other possibilities. Wait, if the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's H2O? No, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron) and an O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons (assuming the isotope is O-16). So total protons: 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Oh! Wait, that would make sense. So H2O has 1
