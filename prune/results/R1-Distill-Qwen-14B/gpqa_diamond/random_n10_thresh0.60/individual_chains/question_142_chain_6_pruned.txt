Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ which is 1/2 times the sum of |0><0| and |1><1|. So ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. But wait, what's the geometrical position of this in the qubit space? 

I think qubit space is represented as a Bloch sphere. Oh right, any single qubit state can be represented on a unit sphere. But wait, density matrices are more general. So how do they map onto the Bloch sphere? 

I recall that for a density matrix ρ, it can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The equation is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and I is the identity matrix. So if I can write the given ρ in that form, I can find the components of r.

Let me write out the given ρ. Since |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in (1,1) and 0 elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1|. So adding them together gives a diagonal matrix with 1 and 1. Then, when multiplied by 1/2, it becomes diagonal with 1/2 and 1/2. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with entries [0.5, 0; 0, 0.5]. 

Wait, but I thought that for a state like |ψ><ψ|, it's a pure state. But this ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So is this a mixed state? Because when you average two orthogonal pure states, you get a mixed state. 

So how does this relate to the Bloch vector? Let's compare ρ with the general form (I + r·σ)/2. Let me compute (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]].

So if we have r
