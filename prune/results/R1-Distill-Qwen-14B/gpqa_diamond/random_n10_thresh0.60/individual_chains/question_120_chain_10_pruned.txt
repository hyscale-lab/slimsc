Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax angle (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So the formula is plx = 1/distance, right? Or wait, maybe it's plx in arcseconds equals 1 over distance in parsecs. Oh yeah, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 astronomical unit subtends 1 arcsecond. So d = 1/plx.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So if we think about a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range? Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number should depend on the volume of space they occupy.

Wait, volume. Because the number of stars depends on the volume. If the distribution is uniform, the number of stars is proportional to the volume. But how does volume relate to parallax.

So, for a given parallax plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. So for a range of plx from plx to plx + Δplx, the corresponding distances are from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + Δplx). But wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of differential elements.

Oh, right, think about it as a thin shell between distances d and d + dd. The volume of such a shell is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell volume is the difference between r³ and (r+dr)³, which for small dr is 4πr² dr.

But in terms of parallax, since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, plx =1/d, so d = 1/plx. So differentiating both sides, dd = -1/(plx^2) * dplx. So the volume element dV is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, we have dV =4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, but for our purposes of counting stars, the negative just tells us about the direction, so probably we can take the absolute value.

So dV =4π (1/pl
