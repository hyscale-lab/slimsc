Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I need to figure out which one never requires regularization when dealing with high energies. Let me think. 

First, what does regularization mean? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math not work out. Regularization helps make these calculations finite and manageable so that you can renormalize the theory. 

The question is asking which theory doesn't need regularization at high energies. So, I'm looking for a theory that's finite or doesn't have these divergences. 

Let's look at the options:

A) Superstring Theory. I know string theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Strings are these tiny vibrating objects, right? I think string theory has a different approach. Wait, but I'm not sure if it requires regularization. I remember that string theories, especially superstring theories, are supposed to be UV finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories. Because they're background-independent and have a higher-dimensional structure, maybe they don't need regularization. But I'm not 100% certain.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). That's the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory, and at low energies, it's confining, meaning quarks are stuck together. But at high energies, like in deep inelastic scattering, QCD becomes asymptotically free. Wait, but does it require regularization? I think QCD does use regularization methods because of loop divergences. Like, when calculating loop diagrams, you need to regularize to handle the infinities. So QCD probably needs regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). That's the theory of electromagnetism. QED is a well-established theory. I know that QED does have issues with divergences, especially in calculations like the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization. But because it's a renormalizable theory, you can absorb these infinities into counterterms. So yes, QED requires regularization before renormalization. So option C needs regularization and isn't the answer.

D) Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, wait. Classical theories don't have the same quantum divergences because they don't involve the same calculations as quantum field theories. In classical electrodynamics, you might have issues like the infinite charge density of a point charge, but those aren't the same as the divergences in QFT. But wait, the question is about high energies. In classical theories, you don't quantize fields, so you don't have the same divergences that require regularization. So maybe D is an option.

Wait, but the point is that regularization is a quantum field theory method. So classical theories wouldn't require regularization because they don't have the same infinities. So the theory that never requires regularization is the classical one, right?

So the options are looking for which theory never needs regularization. The other theories (QED, QCD, superstring) are quantum theories and may require regularization, except maybe superstring theory.

Wait, but wait. I thought superstring theory is supposed to be finite because it has a different structure, so it doesn't need regularization. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in superstring theory, they don't need regularization because the theory is free from diverg
