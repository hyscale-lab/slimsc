Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Hmm, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. That's interesting because usually, wave functions are supposed to be normalizable, right? So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but in this case, the particles are found only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that interval. Oh wait, no, the question says when measuring, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. That suggests that the wave function is zero outside this region. Or maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3? Because if the wave function were non-zero elsewhere, you might expect some probability of finding the particle outside that range, but the measurements say none were found. So I think the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which is valid in the region where the particle exists. So maybe the wave function is zero outside 1<x<3, and the given expression applies within that interval.

Wait, the problem states: "the wave function of each particle, in a part of space where it can exist, can be described as..." So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.
