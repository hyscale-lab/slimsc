Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, often for things like measuring stellar velocities, chemical compositions, etc.

The key point from the question is about the apparent V magnitudes that each spectrograph can observe. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be brighter than 17 mag because that's the higher limit (since 17 is fainter than 16). Wait, no wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16. So, if a star has V mag 16.5, it's fainter than 16, so HIRES can't see it? No, wait, no. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17. So for a star to be observed by both, it must have V mag ≤ 17 (since ESPRESSO can go to 17, but HIRES can go to 16, so the limiting factor is 17. So any star with V mag ≤17 can be observed by both.

But wait, no. Wait, the way the question is phrased, it's the apparent V magnitude that each can observe. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So if a star's apparent V is 17 or brighter (which in magnitude terms is brighter than 17, i.e., magnitude less than 17), it's observable. Similarly for HIRES: stars brighter than 16 mag.

So for a star to be detected by both, it's apparent V must be ≤ 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and also ≤16 (so HIRES can see it). Wait, no, because HIRES can only see brighter than 16. Wait,
