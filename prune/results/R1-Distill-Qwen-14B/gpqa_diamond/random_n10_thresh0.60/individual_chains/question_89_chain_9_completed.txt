Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's take it slow.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite a tough molecule. The structure is something like two cyclohexane rings fused together in a diamond-like lattice. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the first and third positions, but wait, adamantane is a three-dimensional structure. Oh right, in adamantane, each carbon is part of a chair-like structure, and the numbering is such that 1 and 3 are opposite each other across the molecule.

So when this compound is heated with excess KOH, it's probably undergoing dehydrohalogenation. KOH is a strong base, so elimination reactions are likely. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it forms a diene? Wait, but elimination typically forms a double bond, so each Br would leave, taking a proton with it. But wait, in dibrominated compounds, eliminating two equivalents would form a conjugated diene perhaps.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. After KOH, the product is probably a diol if it's a substitution, but more likely, elimination. Because KOH can cause elimination (E2 or E1) when heated. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon heating with KOH would lose HBr twice, forming a diene. So the product would be 1,3-diamantadiene? Or maybe 1,2-diene? No, wait, the structure of adamantane is such that 1 and 3 are on adjacent positions, so eliminating two HBr would form a conjugated diene. So product 1 is 1,3-diamantadiene or perhaps 1,2-diamantadiene? I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Wait, that's conflicting because if product 1 is an alkene, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the first step isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution. But KOH is a strong base, so substitution would need a good leaving group. Dibromides can undergo substitution, but with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double substitution. So perhaps the product is an alcohol? But that wouldn't explain the IR carbonyl.

Wait, wait, when dibromides react with strong bases, sometimes they can form epoxides if it's a vicinal dihalide, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. No, that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Oh! Wait, I remember that when 1,2-dihaloalkanes are treated with a base, they can eliminate twice to form an alkene. But in this case, we have 1,3-dibromo. Oh, wait, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, but maybe the structure allows for a conjugated diene.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So the product after KOH might have a ketone group. Hmm, how could that happen? Maybe the base is causing an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, wait! Oh! Maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement? But pinacol rearrangement typically involves 1,2-diol losing water to form a carbonyl. Hmm, but we have Br here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base abstracts a beta proton, causing the bromide to leave as Br-, forming a carbocation, which then loses another Br- but that might not form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an E1cb mechanism, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, another possibility: the heating of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could result in the formation of an epoxide. But I don't think that's right because epoxidation usually requires peracids or other oxidizing agents, and KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkene but a diol. But then the IR peak wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal dihalide elimination, but 1,3-dibromo isn't geminal.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more like the formation of an alkoxide, which upon dehydration forms a carbonyl. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think—another approach: looking at the NMR.

The NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's around the region for an alcohol or an -OCH2- group. But the IR has a carbonyl, so maybe it's an ester or ketone. Wait, another thought: maybe the product is adamantanone. Because adamantane can lose two protons and form a ketone? Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe each Br is on a secondary carbon. When KOH is used, the two Br atoms could be eliminated as HBr, forming a double bond. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexene ring, but that doesn't fit with the NMR. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the first step is actually a substitution, but two substitutions would form a diol. But the IR doesn't support an OH group. Oh, wait, but in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm is two H, which could be an -OCH2- group. But if it's a diol, the protons would be OH, which would appear broad, but the problem states that the solvent is deuterated, so maybe the OH is exchanged and not observed. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether. But why the IR peak at 1720? Unless the product is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. Let me try to imagine the structure. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr (each Br leaves with a proton), forming a conjugated diene. Then the product after KOH is a diene. But then, why the IR has a carbonyl? That doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the reaction wrong. Perhaps the base isn't causing elimination but instead is deprotonating to form an alkoxide, which then loses Br- as a leaving group. Or maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but that would require a good leaving group and perhaps form an alcohol, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Alternatively, another thought: maybe the product is a ketone, and the IR peak is from that. So how could KOH cause the formation of a ketone from a dibromide?

Wait, perhaps the base is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but the structure of adamantane allows for the formation of a carbonyl group upon elimination. Let me think about the mechanism. If each Br is on a tertiary carbon, perhaps eliminating two HBr could form a carbonyl.

Wait, if each Br is on adjacent carbons, but in this case, it's 1 and 3 positions. Maybe elimination forms a conjugated diene, but perhaps that's not leading to a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is abstracting a proton that's adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a carbocation, which could rearrange.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm is for 2H. Maybe that's an -OCH2- group, or perhaps it's an ethereal oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 region is 10H, which suggests multiple equivalent protons, perhaps on CH2 groups. The 1.94 ppm is 2H, maybe on a CH2 group adjacent to the oxygen. 

Wait, the IR at 1720 is a strong carbonyl. Maybe the product is a diketone? Or perhaps a ketone and an ester?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a epoxide ring, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, another approach: the product after KOH could be a diol, but then perhaps it undergoes oxidation. But the problem says it's product 1 after KOH, which is a light solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a carbonyl via elimination, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, and the NMR reflects that. The 4.79 ppm is for an oxygen-bearing group, maybe an ether or an alcohol, but in the presence of a ketone, perhaps.

Wait, maybe the product is a geminal diol, but that's unlikely with KOH. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enol ether. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the next step. Product 1 is then heated with excess Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl group, so maybe it's a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of Friedel-Crafts type reaction. But ketones aren't typically activated for Friedel-Crafts; more likely, if product 1 is an alcohol or something that can form a carbocation, Al isopropoxide could help in that.

Wait, but product 1 has a carbonyl. Maybe it's a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of alkylation or acylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and Al isopropoxide is acting as a Lewis acid, perhaps facilitating some kind of polymerization or cyclization. Alternatively, maybe it's a diene that's being alkylated.

But I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think step by step.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. Let's think about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on opposite faces, perhaps. So when KOH is added, the two Br groups are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. Wait, no, 1 and 3 are not adjacent in adamantane. Let me correct that: in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is connected to three others, and the positions 1 and 3 are on different parts of the structure.

When KOH is heated with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br leaves, leading to the formation of a conjugated diene. So product 1 is 1,3-diamantadiene. Then, the IR would have a peak at around 1600 cm-1 for the C=C stretch, but the problem says 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I was wrong about the first step. Maybe it's an elimination to form a ketone. Wait, how? Maybe each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Let me think: if two HBr are eliminated, perhaps the structure collapses to form a ketone. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH3 group, eliminating two HBr could form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that eliminating two HBr would form a single ketone. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone or something like adamantanone. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone derivative. But then the NMR wouldn't have such a high chemical shift for 2H at 4.79 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Wait, maybe the first reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution, but that would require a good nucleophile. But with KOH, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction. However, with two Br atoms, maybe it's a double substitution, leading to a diol. But the IR doesn't show OH groups, so that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diether. But again, the IR doesn't fit.

Another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane when treated with KOH could undergo a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. If each Br is on a carbon next to a methyl group, perhaps elimination of HBr would form a ketone. For example, if each Br is on a CH2 group adjacent to a CH2 group, eliminating HBr twice would form a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

Then, the product 1's NMR would show a carbonyl, but the IR is already showing 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So in the NMR, the carbonyl would be a singlet as it doesn't have any neighboring protons. But the given NMR doesn't have a peak that would be for a carbonyl (like around 2 ppm for C=O in carbonyls, but actually, in 1H NMR, the carbonyl is not directly observed because it's carbon, not proton. Wait, I'm confusing 1H and 13C NMR. The IR is for C=O, but the NMR is 1H. So the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be an oxygen-bearing group, perhaps an ether or an alcohol.

But perhaps in the first step, the product is a diol. Then, product 1 is a diol, but the IR doesn't show OH, so that's confusing.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Then, the IR would have a strong peak, and the NMR would show perhaps some protons near the carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of the first step is a dienol ether or something else. I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, let me think about the second step. Product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation, but ketones aren't typically activated for that.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alkyl halide. No, because the first step was with KOH, which would substitute Br- for OH-.

Wait, another possibility: the first step forms an epoxide. Then, product 1 is an epoxide. But how would the IR show a carbonyl? Unless the epoxide ring is opened in a way that forms a carbonyl, which I don't think is the case.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes some kind of Diels-Alder reaction. But I don't have enough information about what the other reactant is.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes dehydration to form a ketone. But then the second product would be a ketone, and the third product after ozonolysis would be something else.

Wait, but the initial product 1's IR is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, so that suggests product 1 is a carbonyl compound.

So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide and heat, it undergoes some kind of alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 is a ketone, which isn't usually a substrate for Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone, and Al isopropoxide helps in some kind of rearrangement. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, which upon reaction with Al isopropoxide forms an epoxide or something else.

I'm stuck on the first step, so perhaps I should think about the subsequent steps.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78C, then dimethyl sulfide is added. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. So product 2 is an alkene, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl compounds (product 3). The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding exchangeables).

So product 3 is the result of ozonolysis of product 2. Let me think: product 2 must have a double bond, and ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would be a di-ketone or two separate carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but product 2 comes from product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an alkylated version, such as a di-substituted ketone, which upon ozonolysis would break into two fragments, each with a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which upon ozonolysis gives product 3 as two carbonyl groups.

Wait, product 1 is a ketone. So when product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's not typical for ketones. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienol ether, and Al isopropoxide is facilitating some kind of cyclization.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and Al isopropoxide is causing some kind of dimerization, but that's unclear.

Wait, if product 1 is a diene, then treating it with Al isopropoxide (which is a Lewis acid) could facilitate a Diels-Alder reaction, but without a dienophile, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and Al isopropoxide is causing it to undergo a hydrogen shift, forming a more substituted double bond (like in carbocation rearrangements).

But perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyls. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be near a carbonyl group, perhaps as an alpha proton.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded H (probably closest to the carbonyl) would couple with neighboring Hs. Let's imagine that product 3 is a diketone, say, two ketone groups connected to some CH2 groups. The coupling would depend on the structure.

Wait, let me think about what the coupling could be. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

The most deshielded H is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, so it's an alpha proton. If that H is next to a CH2 group, then it would couple with two Hs on each side.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the H in question is adjacent to a CH2-CH2 group. Let's say the structure is (CH2)2(C=O)–(something). So the H in question is on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Each H on that CH2 would couple with the neighboring Hs.

Wait, more specifically, let's imagine the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The CH2 would be split by adjacent groups. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would see two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H in the CH2 would be split by each of the two Hs in the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group with two Hs, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the H is on a CH2 group that's next to another CH2 group, which is next to a CH3 or something else.

Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose the structure is (CH2)2(C=O)–R. The Hs on the CH2 closest to the carbonyl would each couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But another possibility is that the H is on a CH2 group that's next to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. In that case, the coupling would involve more Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH group. Then, the coupling would involve more Hs, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 is a compound like (CH2)2(CO)R. The Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two neighboring Hs on the same CH2 and two on the adjacent CH2 (if there's another CH2). Wait, no, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2, it would be a triplet due to coupling with two equivalent Hs. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet.

But wait, the options include triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), etc. So in that case, if each H is coupled with two Hs (each on adjacent CH2 groups), then it's a triplet.

But wait, perhaps the coupling is more complex. Suppose the H is on a CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to another CH2 group. Then, each H would couple with two Hs (from the adjacent CH2) and perhaps also with another set from another adjacent group.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 that's next to a CH group, but that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: the most deshielded H is likely to be adjacent to the carbonyl group, so it's on a CH2 next to the carbonyl. Let's say the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-X. The Hs on the CO-CH2 would each be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. If the coupling constant is the same, it's a clean triplet. But if there are two different coupling constants, it could be a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, but if the adjacent group is a CH2 with two Hs, then each H on the CO-CH2 would be split by each of the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, maybe the adjacent group is a CH with two Hs, which would lead to each H seeing two couplings, but from different J values.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded H is on a CH group next to a CH2. For example, CH2-CH2-CO. Then, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have each H coupled with the Hs on the adjacent CH2. Each H would see two Hs, so triplet.

But wait, another possibility: the H is part of a CH2 group that's between two other CH2 groups. In that case, each H would have coupling with two Hs on each side, leading to more splitting. For example, if it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, then the middle CH2's Hs would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2, which would result in a triplet of triplets (each H is split by two on the left and two on the right, leading to 2+2+1 = 5 peaks, but actually it's a doublet of doublets, but perhaps in reality, it's a triplet of triplets if the coupling constants are similar).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's think: if a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, each H on the middle CH2 would couple with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. Since each coupling has a similar J value, the splitting would be a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but how does that work? Let's say each H on the middle CH2 has two adjacent Hs on each side. So for each H, it's coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other. The splitting would be first split into a triplet by the first two Hs, and then each of those peaks would be further split into triplets by the next two Hs. So each peak becomes three, and each of those becomes three, leading to 3x3=9 peaks, but that's a nonet. Alternatively, if the coupling constants are similar, it's more likely a triplet of triplets, which would be 3+3-1=5? No, triplet of triplets would be 3x3=9. But that's not one of the options. The options are triplet (A), triplet of triplets (B), doublet of triplets (C), pentet (D).

Wait, perhaps the H is only coupled to one set of two Hs. So a triplet.

Alternatively, maybe the H is on a CH2 next to a CH group, which has two Hs. Then, each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH, leading to a triplet. But if the CH has two Hs, perhaps the coupling is to those two, so each H on CH2 would see two Hs, giving a triplet.

So perhaps the coupling pattern is a triplet, which is option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again about the structure.

Assuming product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2, which is a diene. Ozonolysis would break the diene into two carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a diene, product 3 would be two carbonyl compounds connected by some chain.

Wait, but wait, ozonolysis of a diene would typically break it into two carbonyl compounds. For example, if product 2 is a 1,3-diene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls connected by some groups. Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, like cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups connected by a chain.

Wait, let me think about product 2. It's product 1 heated with Al isopropoxide. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an enol ether or an alkene formed via some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol and product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination with Al isopropoxide as a Lewis acid catalyst.

But I'm not making progress on the structure. Maybe I should think about the most deshielded H in product 3.

The most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. In the case of ozonolysis, that H would be adjacent to the carbonyl. So it's on a CH2 next to the carbonyl.

If that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H on the CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So in the NMR spectrum, the most deshielded H would appear as a triplet. So the correct answer would be option A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Step**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double elimination reaction, forming a conjugated diene. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the reaction forms a ketone, such as adamantanone, rather than a diene. The NMR data supports this: the peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) could correspond to protons near a carbonyl group, and the other peaks (2.41-2.23 ppm and 1.94 ppm) likely correspond to equivalent protons on CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

2. **Second Step**: Heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide likely facilitates a reaction involving the ketone. Al isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid, could promote a rearrangement or further reaction, but the exact nature of product 2 is unclear. However, it is inferred that product 2 contains a double bond, as ozonolysis is performed in the next step.

3. **Third Step**: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. Therefore, product 3 likely contains carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Key Analysis for Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with the two equivalent hydrogens on the same CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet coupling pattern. This conclusion aligns with the NMR data and the expected splitting pattern for such a hydrogen.

Based on this reasoning, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
