Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Quantum states having lifetimes... Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of an energy state is related to the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time uncertainty is at least h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. So, the lifetime here probably refers to the uncertainty in time, τ, which would relate to the uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

The question is asking which energy difference allows them to be clearly distinguished. I think this has to do with the energy resolution needed so that the two states are not confused. So, the energy difference needs to be larger than some minimum value based on their lifetimes.

Wait, how does the lifetime relate to the uncertainty in energy? I remember the formula: ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, isn't ħ approximately h/(2π), and h is Planck's constant. So, ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime. Longer lifetime means more precise energy measurement, so smaller ΔE uncertainty.

So for each state, their lifetimes τ1 and τ2 are 1e-9 s and 1e-8 s. So the uncertainties in energy for each would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1, and ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2.

Wait, but what's the significance of these uncertainties for distinguishing the two states? Hmm. Oh, wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, right? So, the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish them, this ΔE needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps each of their uncertainties?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy resolution required. In energy measurements, the uncertainty principle tells us that the precision of the energy measurement is limited by the time over which the measurement is made. So the energy difference between the two states must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state for them to be distinguishable.

Wait, but the two states have different lifetimes. Let me think: For a state with a longer lifetime (like 1e-
