Okay, so I have this astronomy question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question carefully and understand what's being asked.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Both are high-resolution spectrographs, so I think their capabilities are similar, but their observing capacities differ based on the brightness of the stars they can observe.

The key data given are the apparent V magnitudes that each spectrograph can detect. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait. Because, when they say "brighter than," in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a magnitude of 17 is dimmer than 16. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars up to 17 mag, meaning it can see fainter stars than HIRES, which stops at 16. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent magnitude must be ≤16 mag because HIRES can't see beyond that, but ESPRESSO can. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 for both to detect it.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, brighter than 17 would mean apparent magnitude less than 17. But in astronomy, magnitude scales
