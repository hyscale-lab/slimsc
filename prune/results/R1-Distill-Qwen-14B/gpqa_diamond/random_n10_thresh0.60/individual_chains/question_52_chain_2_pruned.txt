Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, and how that ratio changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Hmm. So when there are no spots, the Teff is higher, 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is spotted, the overall Teff is lower, 5500 K. But wait, does that mean the Teff of the spots themselves is lower? Because dark spots on a star are cooler regions. So the unspotted areas are hotter, and the spots are cooler.

Wait, but the question says that when 40% is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star's overall luminosity is lower when spots are present, but the question is about the photosphere's temperature. Oh wait, but the photosphere is the star's atmosphere, so if the spots are on the photosphere, then the overall effective temperature would be a combination of the spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, but the problem says the Teff decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So the overall Teff is lower because the spots are cooler. But how does this affect the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels?

The ratio in question is the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 compared to level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower.

We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 is the higher energy level, E1 is lower. Since the problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or visible range. Let me think, the energy difference E2 - E1 can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

So, the energy difference is proportional to 1/λ. Wait, but for the Boltzmann factor, we'll need the temperature. But wait, the effective temperature of the star is changing. So when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, the spots are cooler, but the rest of the photosphere is at a higher temperature. So what's the effective temperature of the entire photosphere when spots are present?

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K.
