Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this step by step.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star moves relative to background objects as the Earth orbits the Sun. I remember that the parallax angle (usually in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So, a star with a larger parallax is closer to us, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

Wait, the formula I think is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs) — so distance d = 1/plx. That makes sense because the closer the star, the larger the parallax shift we observe.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, if we consider a range of parallax values, how does the number of stars in that range change with plx?

I think this might relate to the density of stars in the galaxy and how they're distributed in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density (stars per cubic parsec) is constant throughout space.

Let me visualize this. Imagine a sphere around the Sun with radius d. The volume is (4/3)πd³. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within this sphere would be proportional to the volume, right? So N ~ d³.

But wait, the question is about number per unit range of plx. So, let's think in terms of plx. The parallax is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Substitute that into the number of stars: N is proportional to (1/plx)^3. Wait, because N ~ d³, so substituting d = 1/plx gives N ~ (1/plx)^3 = 1/(plx^3).

But wait, that's the number of stars up to a certain distance. The question is about the number per unit plx range. So, perhaps I need to consider how the number of stars in a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx relates to plx.

A thin shell at distance d has a thickness dd. The volume of this shell is approximately 4πd² dd. The number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume, so N_shell ~ 4πd² dd.

But we want N per unit plx range. Let me think about how dd
