Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so they're at 5000 K. Because only one hemisphere has spots, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations—so photometric observations would show a periodic change in brightness. The interesting part is that this situation resembles the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what would be the radius of an exoplanet relative to the star?

Hmm. So, the star's brightness variation is due to the spots. If the spots were the same as the planet blocking the light, what planet size would cause the same dip in brightness.

Wait, the problem states that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude. So I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots with that caused by a planet transit.

I remember that the dip in brightness when a planet transits a star is given by (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius. So the relative change in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in the case of the star spots, it's a bit different. The spots are cooler regions, so when they face us, the star appears slightly dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip.

So let me think about how to calculate the amplitude of this brightness variation caused by the spots.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. So the area covered by spots on one hemisphere is 20% (0.2) of that hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area of spots on the star would be 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) ) = 0.1 π Rstar².

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the filling factor is per hemisphere. So when the star rotates, as the hemisphere with spots comes into view, the spots contribute less brightness.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the change in flux. The star emits flux F = σ T^4. So the total flux from the star is F_total = σ T_eff^4 * 4π Rstar² / (4π) ) = σ T_eff^4 Rstar². Wait, no, the flux is σ T^4 per unit area, and the star's surface area is 4π Rstar². So the total emitted flux is F = σ Teff^4 × 4π Rstar².

Wait, but when a spot is present, the flux from that area is less. The spot has a temperature of 5000 K, so each spot emits less flux. So the
