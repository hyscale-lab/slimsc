Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let's take it piece by piece.

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. Let's look at the spectroscopic data provided.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an O-H stretch. The strong peak around 3400 might be from an acid or an alcohol. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Also, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which could be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe compound X is a substituted aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and an O-H group.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H) — that's a strong indication of an acidic proton, probably from a carboxylic acid. The broad singlet suggests it's exchanging and likely not split because it's a single proton. The next peaks at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet integrates to two protons, so maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but the substituent is probably an electron-withdrawing group because the ring is deactivating. The carbonyl group (like a COOH) would do that. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking further at the NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a methylene group adjacent to something, maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Then, 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) — perhaps another set of methylene groups. The peak at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet or a doublet of a CH3 group, maybe attached to a CH2. And finally, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a 4-substituted benzoic acid. Let me sketch this: the benzoic acid would have the COOH group at position 1 (assuming the substituents are in the para positions). Then, the other substituent is at position 4.

Wait, but in the aromatic region, the two doublets (each 2H) suggest that it's a para-substituted benzene. So positions 1 and 4 have substituents.

So, the substituents are COOH at position 1 and another group at position 4. Let me think about the other groups. The NMR shows a CH3 group (d, 3H) at 1.4 ppm, which is attached to a CH2. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is another CH2. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH2CH3 group.

Wait, the substituent at position 4 would have a chain. Let me try to construct it. The 0.9 t is a CH2CH2CH3 group? Or maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, let's see: the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH3 group (an ethyl group) attached to something else. The CH2 next to that would be at 1.7 (m, 2H). The CH at 2.9 (1H) could be a CH connected to a CH2 and another group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps.

Wait, let's think about a structure. If we have a benzene ring with a COOH at position 1 and a substituent at position 4. The substituent could be a branching group.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's see. A sec-butyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3). But how does that fit with the NMR?

Wait, the substituent could be a group like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? Or wait, no, because the COOH is on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent has a chain. Let me think again. The NMR shows a broad singlet at 10.5, which suggests a carboxylic acid. So compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, the substituent at position 4 is a branched chain. Let's imagine the structure: the benzene ring has COOH at position 1 and a group R at position 4, which is attached as a side chain.

Looking at the non-aromatic peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H). Let me try to arrange these signals.

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an ethyl group connected via a chain. Let's say the substituent is something like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that seems too long.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group, but the substituent is more likely to be a butyl group. Let me think: a butyl group would have four carbons. How do the NMR signals fit?

Wait, the substituent could be a (CH2)2CHCH3 group. But let's try to match it.

Let me consider each peak:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): this would be the terminal CH2CH3 in an ethyl group. So, maybe a -CH2CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, but let's visualize the substituent. Suppose the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. Wait, but that would make the substituent a sec-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring, then the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH2CH3) group: the CH would be around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), correct.

- The adjacent CH2 would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which matches.

- The CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H), which matches.

Wait, but the substituent would be a longer chain. Let me think about the structure:

The substituent on the benzene ring is a propyl group with a branch. Let's say it's a (propane-2-yl) group. Wait, propane-2-yl is an isopropyl group. But then the substituent would be isopropyl, which is -CH(CH3)2. But in that case, the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3's, but in this case, the substituent is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with branching. Let's think of a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). But wait, that's a four-carbon group.

Wait, the substituent would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that might not fit.

Wait, let me try to assign the substituent.

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring and has a chain. Let's imagine the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

So the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4.

Wait, but then the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3), which is a sec-butyl group? No, wait, a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH2CH3) connected to the ring as a substituent. Wait, no, a sec-butyl would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2 group? Or maybe it's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a 3-pentyl group or something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent has a butyl chain with a branch. Let me try to map the NMR data.

The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal ethyl group. So the substituent must end with CH2CH3. The CH2 next to it would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H). Then, the next group is a CH at 2.9 ppm (m,1H). And then a CH3 group at 1.4 ppm (d,3H). Hmm.

Wait, a CH3 group at 1.4 ppm (d,3H) — that's a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is:

The substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached via a CH2.

Wait, let me try to construct it.

The substituent could be:

CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. But that would require more carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent is a (1-methylpropyl) group, which is a iso-butyl group. Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tert-butyl group, but that's more bulky.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2CH(CH2CH3)) group. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then what would the NMR look like?

The substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

But wait, the substituent would have the structure: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Then, the substituent's protons would appear as:

- The CH2 next to the ring (CH2-) would have protons that are split into a triplet or something else.

Wait, no, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). The protons on the CH2 adjacent to the ring (Ph-CH2-) would be a quartet, perhaps, due to coupling with the adjacent CH group. But in the NMR, I don't see a quartet. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a multiplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let's think of a substituent like -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3). No, that's too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, such as a isopropyl group. But the isopropyl group would have a CH(CH3)2, which would give a septet around 1.2 ppm (if it's a singlet), but in our case, the signals are more spread out.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to the ring as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent's structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which would be a sec-butyl group attached via the oxygen? Wait, no, because the substituent is attached directly to the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a terminal methyl, but that doesn't quite fit.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to another CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH3 group. So, the substituent would be a pentyl group? Or butyl?

Wait, perhaps it's a 3-methylbutyl group. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I can think of the substituent as a (CH2)2CHCH3 group — that would be a pentyl group, but that's four carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2 group, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the substituent can be broken down as follows: starting from the benzene, it's attached to a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to a CH group, which is connected to a CH2CH3 group and another CH3 group.

Wait, that would make the substituent a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)- group? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH(CH3)) group, but that's unclear.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think about the NMR signals.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group, but that would be part of a larger chain.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct the substituent:

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring and has the following groups:

- A CH group (2.9 ppm, m,1H).

- A CH2 group (1.7 ppm, m,2H).

- A CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm, t,3H).

- A CH3 group (1.4 ppm, d,3H), which is attached to the CH group.

So, the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2CH3?

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Ph-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2CH3?

No, that doesn't seem to fit either.

Wait, maybe it's a 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid. Let's see.

The substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene.

But that would require more carbons than maybe the substituent has.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the integration.

In the NMR, the signals are:

- 10.5 ppm: 1H (COOH)

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: 2H each (aromatic, para substituents)

- 2.9 ppm: 1H (CH)

- 1.7 ppm: 2H (CH2)

- 1.4 ppm: 3H (CH3, probably attached to CH)

- 0.9 ppm: 3H (CH2CH3)

So, the substituent must have a chain of:

CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3, but connected how?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. But that would be a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, more accurately, the substituent could be a 3-methylpentyl group? Or is it a butyl group with a methyl branch?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that might not fit.

Wait, let me try to outline the substituent:

The substituent is attached to the benzene ring as a side chain. The structure would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2CH3?

Wait, no. Alternatively, it's Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3). But that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group, which would be a sec-butyl group. Let me see.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the ring. That would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

But wait, in that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 (Ph-CH2-) would be next to the ring. But in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to the CH group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid. Let me think: 2-methylpropyl is isobutyl. So, the substituent would be an isobutyl group.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)2 attached to the benzene ring. But then, the NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, but in our NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests it's attached to a CH group.

Wait, in isobutyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)2. The protons on the CH(CH3)2 would be a singlet (if they're equivalent), but in our NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d,3H), which suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH group with another proton. That's more consistent with a substituent where the CH3 is attached to a CH that's also connected to another group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the substituent has a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d,3H) attached to a CH. That CH is connected to another CH2 (1.7 ppm, m,2H), which is connected to a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t,3H).

So, the substituent is a chain: CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Which would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch at the second carbon. So, the substituent is: Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain, which might not be necessary. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)- group attached to another CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch. Let's see. The substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3).

No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the substituent again. The substituent is on the benzene ring, para to the COOH group.

The substituent has a CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H), a CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H), a CH3 group (1.4 ppm, d,3H), and a CH2CH3 group (0.9 ppm, t,3H).

So, the substituent's structure would be:

Ph-COOH

|

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)

Wait, that would mean the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group? No, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)- group, but that's a longer chain, perhaps a pentyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene ring via a CH2.

Wait, that would make the substituent a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

But then the NMR would show:

- The CH2 (Ph-CH2-) as a triplet or quartet, but in our NMR, the CH2 is at 1.7 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is an isobutyl group. Then, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

But in that case, the CH(CH3)2 would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups, but in our NMR, the CH3 is a doublet at 1.4 ppm, which suggests it's attached to a CH with another proton.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking at the options provided.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

In that case, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Let me see what the NMR would look like.

The substituent would have:

- CH2 attached to the ring (Ph-CH2-): the protons here would be a quartet, perhaps, due to coupling with the adjacent CH group.

- The CH group (CH) would have protons that are a multiplet. The NMR shows 2.9 ppm (m,1H), which fits.

- The CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H), which fits.

What about the other signals? The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would correspond to the CH2 adjacent to the CH group.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent's chain is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the CH2 (Ph-CH2-) would have protons as a triplet (if next to another CH2), but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH.

Wait, but in the substituent, the Ph-CH2- would have another CH2 connected to it. So, the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In that structure, the Ph-CH2- would be a CH2 group between the benzene and the CH group.

So, the substituent has a chain of three carbons: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

So, the substituent's protons:

- The CH2 (Ph-CH2-) would split into a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH group's CH2?), but perhaps in the NMR, it's part of a multiplet.

Wait, but in the given NMR, we have a 1.7 ppm (m,2H) which could be the CH2 adjacent to the CH.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be the CH group.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 group attached to a CH. But in this substituent, the CH group is attached to CH2CH3 and the benzene. So, where would the CH3 come from?

Wait, that's the issue. In the substituent of option C, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which means the CH is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the CH is attached to a CH2 (from the benzene) and a CH2CH3.

Wait, but then where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? There's no CH3 attached directly to a CH in the substituent described by option C.

Ah, wait a minute. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the substituent.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is a four-carbon group: benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3).

But then, where does the CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? It's not part of the substituent. Oh wait, unless the substituent is longer. Maybe I'm missing a branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the coupling in the NMR.

The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group with only one neighbor, hence a doublet. So the structure around that would be:

CH(CH3)-

Which is connected to another CH2 group.

So, perhaps the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2CH3?

Wait, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 3-methylpentyl group, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. But let's think about the entire structure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group. That would make the substituent Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)).

No, perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group. The 2-methylpropyl group is isobutyl, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. But in that case, the CH3 groups would be a singlet, which doesn't match the 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the reaction part. The question states that compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. That's a typical reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile or the elimination to form an alkene, but wait, no. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, or in the formation of alkenes from alcohols via the HPhosphite reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's the dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but wait, another reaction: when an alkyl halide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's for the formation of alkenes via theWurtz reaction. But maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the substitution of a nitrile group. Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used to convert a nitrile to an amine, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. If compound X is a nitrile, then upon hydrolysis with H+/H2O, it would form a carboxylic acid. But in that case, the IR would show a strong peak around 2200 cm-1 for the nitrile, which isn't present here. So compound X isn't a nitrile.

Wait, another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI: the elimination of HX from an alcohol to form an alkene. So if the compound has an alcohol group, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of an alkene.

But in the IR data, the 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the reaction is related to the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps compound X is an ester. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might lead to its hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But I thought the IR would show a peak around 1740 cm-1 for an ester, which is close to 1720, but sometimes they can vary.

Wait, looking back, the IR has 1720 cm-1, which is more in line with a ketone, but could also be an ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 3000 cm-1, but the IR here shows 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, typical of an O-H stretch, which could be from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, but 1720 cm-1 in the presence of a broad O-H suggests a carboxylic acid. Because esters typically don't have such a broad O-H. So perhaps compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

But let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Which would have the structure: benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? No, wait, no, the COOH is on the benzene ring.

Wait, the substituent is on the benzene ring, so the structure is benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent would be:

Ph(4)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, the COOH is on the ring. So the structure is:

O

||

COOH attached to the benzene at position 1, and a sec-butyl group attached at position 4.

So, the substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent's structure is: benzene (COOH at position 1, sec-butyl at position 4).

Let me think about the NMR for option C.

The NMR would have:

- The COOH proton at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H).

- The aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm).

- The substituent's protons: the CH2 group next to the ring (Ph-CH2-) would be a triplet at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could fit.

The CH group (Ph-CH2-CH-) would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H).

The CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

But wait, where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from in the NMR? Because in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a CH3 attached to a CH. So this would be a problem. Unless the substituent has another CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(sec-butyl) group, which is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? There's no CH3 attached to a CH in the substituent.

Ah, maybe I'm missing something. The substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a methyl group attached to the CH. So the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) must come from another part of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is not just the sec-butyl group. Let me check the molecular structure again. Wait, in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. The substituent's structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which would have the CH2, CH, and CH2CH3 groups but no CH3 attached to a CH. Therefore, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) in the NMR must come from another part of the molecule. But in option C, the substituent doesn't have a CH(CH3) group. So this suggests that option C might not be the correct structure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the substituent. Let me think again.

If the substituent is a pentyl group with a branch, perhaps it's a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group. So the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)).

Wait, but that would require a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is an isobutyl group.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2.

But then, the NMR would show the CH(CH3)2 as a singlet, but in our case, the CH3 is a doublet at 1.4 ppm, which suggests it's attached to a CH with another proton.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene.

So, the structure would be Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, then the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group.

In that case, the substituent has a CH(CH3) group, which would have a CH3 attached as a doublet, matching the 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The adjacent CH2 groups would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H) and 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

Wait, but wait, in this structure, the substituent is Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

So, the substituent would have the following:

- The CH(CH3) group is attached to the benzene and to a CH2CH2CH3 group.

So, the CH(CH3) group would be at around 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

The CH2 group adjacent to it (CH2-CH2CH3) would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H).

The terminal CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

And the CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

That seems to fit all the given NMR data.

So, the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is an isobutyl group attached as a substituent.

Wait, but wait, 2-methylpropyl is actually the same as isobutyl. Yes, because isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but in this substituent, I'm thinking of Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3, which is actually a pentyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. Let me think about the options.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would be:

COOH attached to benzene at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In this structure, the substituent has a CH2 group (Ph-CH2-) that is next to the ring, then a CH group (CH(CH2CH3)), which is connected to a CH2CH3.

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 (Ph-CH2-) as a triplet (if next to another CH2 group), but in the given data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could fit.

The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

The CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? There's no CH3 attached to a CH in the substituent of option C. So perhaps option C isn't the correct choice.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which would be Ph-CH(CH3)2. But that's an isopropyl group attached to the ring. But then the substituent would have a CH(CH3)2 group, and the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 groups, which isn't the case here.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(1-methylpropyl) group, which is a tert-butyl group. But that would have a CH3 group attached to a central CH, giving a singlet, which doesn't match the 1.4 ppm doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group. So, the substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

But that seems too long, and I'm not sure if that's supported by the NMR.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a 4-(2-methylbutyl) group. Let me consider that.

The substituent would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(pentyl) group. But that would have more carbons than necessary.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reaction part now, as I'm stuck on the structure.

The reaction is between compound X and red phosphorus and HI. This is likely a reaction to form a carboxylic acid from a nitrile or a ketone. Alternatively, if X is a nitrile, the reaction would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But if X is a ketone, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could be a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone or ester.

If X is a ketone, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus might lead to a reduction. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, another reaction: if X is a benzylic halide, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of an alkene via the HWE (Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons) reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of a molecule, such as H2O, to form an alkene.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. If X is an ester, reacting with water (maybe under acidic conditions) would form a carboxylic acid. But the presence of red phosphorus might be for another purpose, like activating the ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Let me try to think of the possible products.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, and option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

If the reaction is hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, then X would be an ester, and the product would be the corresponding acid.

But let me think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. For example, nitrile + H2O under acidic conditions (like H2SO4) gives a carboxylic acid. But red phosphorus and HI are more commonly used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of a leaving group, such as a bromide, with HI, but that doesn't directly relate to the given options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkene via the elimination of HX. So, if X has a structure with adjacent leaving groups, the reaction would eliminate HX and form a double bond.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group. For example, if X is a ketone, the reaction could reduce it to a secondary alcohol. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI are typical reducing agents for ketones.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used in the formation of alkenes from alcohols via theWurtz reaction, but that requires two alkyl halides and is used for elimination.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzyl chloride, and the reaction forms a benzyl iodide, but that's not directly relevant to the options given.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile. If X is a nitrile, then the reaction with H2O and acid would form a carboxylic acid. For example, R-C≡N + H2O → R-COOH.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, then reaction with H2O and acid (like red phosphorus and HI, which can act as a catalyst or source of H+), would form 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

In that case, the NMR of X would have a nitrile peak around 2200 cm-1, but the given IR doesn't show that. So perhaps X isn't a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

If X is an ester, then the IR would have a peak around 1740 cm-1, which isn't present here. The given IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a ketone or an acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch, which is present here (3400–2500 cm-1), and the 1720 cm-1 could be the carbonyl of the acid.

Wait, that suggests that X is a carboxylic acid already, making the reaction part confusing.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to summarize:

The IR data suggests a carboxylic acid (broad O-H and 1720 cm-1).

The NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), which is the COOH proton. So X is a benzoic acid derivative.

The substituent has a chain that matches a sec-butyl group, making option C a possibility.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the substituent in option C doesn't account for the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) signal. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the substituent's structure is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Which would have the following protons:

- The CH2 (Ph-CH2-) would be as a triplet (if adjacent to another CH2 group), but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H.

- The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The CH2CH3 group at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? It's a CH3 group attached to a CH, but in option C's substituent, there's no such group.

Ah, wait a minute. Maybe the substituent is a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group, which would have a methyl group attached to the CH.

So, substituent structure: Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)).

Wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch.

In that case, the substituent would have:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-.

So, the substituent has a CH(CH3) group.

So, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3) group at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The CH(CH3) group's CH3 at 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

- The adjacent CH2 groups would be at 1.7 ppm (m,2H) and 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

That would fit all the NMR data.

So, the substituent is a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group, making the structure 4-(3-methylbutyl)benzoic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, which doesn't have the CH(CH3) group.

So perhaps option C isn't correct, unless I'm missing something.

Another possibility is that the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is an isobutyl group, leading to structure Ph-CH(CH3)2, but that doesn't account for the 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylbutyl) group. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

But again, I'm not seeing how that would fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is an isobutyl group, but that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(3-methylpentyl) group, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group with an additional CH2 group.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent's structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In this case, the substituent's CH2 (Ph-CH2-) would have protons that are a triplet (if adjacent to another CH2 group), but in the NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could correspond to the CH2 next to the CH group.

The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

The CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

But where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? There's no CH3 attached to a CH in the substituent of option C. So this suggests that option C might not be the correct structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group, which would have a CH(CH3) group, explaining the 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

So, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-.

In that case, the substituent has a CH(CH3) group, and the NMR would have the CH3 as a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

So, the substituent's structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH(CH3)).

Which would fit the NMR data:

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): CH2CH3.

- 1.7 ppm (m,2H): CH2 adjacent to CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m,1H): CH group.

- 1.4 ppm (d,3H): CH3 attached to CH.

So, the substituent is a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group.

But looking at the options, none of them mention a 3-methylbutyl group. The options have substituents like sec-butyl, isobutyl, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct structure is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think again.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then its structure is:

COOH attached at position 1, and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

But then, the NMR would show:

- COOH proton at 10.5.

- Aromatic protons as two doublets (8.0 and 7.2 ppm).

- The substituent's CH2 (Ph-CH2-) would have protons as a triplet (if next to another CH2), but in the NMR, 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H.

- The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) would be at 2.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm.

But again, where does the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) come from? There's no CH3 attached to a CH in option C's substituent. So perhaps option C isn't the correct structure.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is an isobutyl group, but that doesn't account for the 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(3-methylbutyl) group, which would fit all the NMR data.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the substituent isn't a butyl group but a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is isobutyl. But again, the CH3 groups would be a singlet, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, and the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the CH3 attached to the CH group in the substituent.

Wait, that would mean the substituent is a -CH(CH3)- group attached to a CH2 and CH2CH3.

So, the substituent would be Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Which would have the following NMR signals:

- COOH: 10.5 ppm.

- Aromatic: 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

- CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

- The adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m,2H).

- The terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

- The CH3 attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d,3H).

That fits all the given data.

So, the substituent would be a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is an isobutyl group.

Wait, but wait, the substituent Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 would have five carbons, making it a pentyl group with a branch.

In that case, the substituent is a 4-(2-methylbutyl) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group. So, the substituent is Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

In that case, the substituent is a 4-(2-methylbutyl) group.

But I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

But in this case, the substituent doesn't have a CH(CH3) group, so the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) must come from elsewhere. But in the structure of option C, there's no such methyl group.

So perhaps option C isn't the correct structure. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the reaction part. Let's think about the reaction again.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen? Well, maybe nothing, because X is already a carboxylic acid. Unless the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction forms a carboxylic acid. So, let's say X is the ester, and after hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

But without the nitrile peak in the IR, that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't hydrolysis. Perhaps it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl bromide derivative, and the reaction with HI forms a benzyl iodide.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene with a substituent that, upon reaction, forms an alkene.

Alternatively, if X is a benzaldehyde, the reaction with HI might form an addition product, but that's just a shot in the dark.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reaction doesn't change the substituent but affects another part of the molecule. For example, if X is a bromo-substituted compound, the reaction could substitute Br with I.

But the options don't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid chloride from a carboxylic acid, but that's usually done with SOCl2, not red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to conclude.

Based on the IR and NMR data, the structure of X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a methyl group attached to a CH, which is connected to a CH2 and CH2CH3 group. So the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, making the compound 4-(2-methylpropyl)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But this doesn't have the CH(CH3) group. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the substituent.

The substituent has:

- A CH3 group (1.4 ppm, d,3H) attached to a CH.

- The CH is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m,2H).

- The CH2 is connected to a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t,3H).

So, the substituent is: CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Which would make the substituent a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is isobutyl.

Wait, no, because isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, which is CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, but that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, and the structure is Ph-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

But that's a pentyl group with a branch.

Hmm.

Wait, considering the options again:

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The substituent is Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, in the NMR, the substituent would show:

- The CH2 (Ph-CH2-) as a triplet in the 1.7 ppm region.

But in the given data, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could fit.

Wait, but the substituent's CH(CH2CH3) would be at 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

The CH2CH3 group would be at 0.9 ppm (t,3H).

But no CH3 attached to a CH, so the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) must come from elsewhere. But there's no such group in option C's structure.

Therefore, perhaps option C isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the substituent isn't a butyl group but a propyl group with a methyl branch, making it a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group.

But without a match in the options, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 4-(2-methylpropyl) group, and the correct option isn't listed, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that the substituent is a butyl group and it's actually a pentyl group.

But I'm running out of time, so I'll make an educated guess.

The NMR data suggests a substituent with a CH(CH3) group, so the correct structure must have that. Among the options, only option C has a substituent that, when considering the reaction, would form a product consistent with the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about the substituent but about the COOH group. For example, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid.

But without the ester peak in IR, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the dehydration of the carboxylic acid to form an acid anhydride, but that's not supported by the options.

Hmm.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Even though the substituent doesn't account for all the NMR data, perhaps I'm missing something.


The problem involves identifying compound X based on its IR and NMR data and predicting the final product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### IR and NMR Data Analysis
1. **IR Data**:
   - Peaks at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** suggest an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - A peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates a carbonyl group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
   - Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest aromatic C=C stretching.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₂CH₃ group.

From this data, compound X is identified as a benzoic acid derivative with a para-substituted aromatic ring and a side chain containing a CH₃, CH, CH₂, and CH₂CH₃ groups.

### Reaction Analysis
The reaction involves red phosphorus and HI, which are typically used for hydrolysis reactions. Given the IR and NMR data, X is likely a nitrile or ester that undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid. However, the IR data does not show a peak around 2200 cm⁻¹ (expected for a nitrile) or 1740 cm⁻¹ (expected for an ester), suggesting X is already a carboxylic acid.

### Option Analysis
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure does not match the NMR data, as it lacks the CH group at 2.9 ppm and the CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure is inconsistent with the IR data, as it lacks a carbonyl group and a carboxylic acid.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure matches the IR data (carboxylic acid and aromatic ring) and the NMR data:
   - The para-substituted aromatic ring explains the doublets at 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm.
   - The CH₂ group (Ph-CH₂-) explains the multiplet at 1.7 ppm.
   - The CH group (CH(CH₂CH₃)) explains the multiplet at 2.9 ppm.
   - The CH₂CH₃ group explains the triplet at 0.9 ppm.
   However, the CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is not accounted for in this structure, raising some doubts.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure is inconsistent with the IR data, as it lacks a carbonyl group and a carboxylic acid.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** is the most consistent with the IR and NMR data, despite the unresolved discrepancy regarding the CH₃ group at 1.4 ppm. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely does not alter the structure, as X is already a carboxylic acid.

ANSWER: C
