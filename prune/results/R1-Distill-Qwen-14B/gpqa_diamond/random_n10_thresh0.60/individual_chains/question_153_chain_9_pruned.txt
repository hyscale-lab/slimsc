Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the correct reactants and products. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me restate what I know about the Michael reaction. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and creating a resonance-stabilized enolate intermediate. The product is typically a conjugated enone or similar after protonation.

The problem presents three different reactions (A, B, C), and I need to match each with their respective products from the options given. Let's take them one by one.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ A.

Hmm, okay. So dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. Wait, it's an enolate already, right? Because malonate has two ester groups, and when treated with a base like NaOEt (sodium ethoxide), it deprotonates to form an enolate. The enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Wait, but what's the other reagent? Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(C6H4-p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3 with a substituent on the middle carbon. Wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, maybe the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-... so the substituent is on the middle carbon. So maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3, but wait, that would be a propenoate. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2
