Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question says: Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options given are four different energy differences, and I need to pick the one that allows them to be clearly resolved.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle plays a role in energy measurements. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the energy-time uncertainty principle formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But wait, I think the exact form might have a factor of 1 or 2, but I think for this purpose, the exact factor isn't crucial. The main idea is that if the lifetime (which is Δt) is shorter, the uncertainty in energy is larger, meaning it's harder to resolve small energy differences.

Wait, but in this problem, the lifetimes (Δt) are given as 10^-9 s and 10^-8 s. I'm trying to find the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime, right? Because ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt).

But wait, actually, the lifetime is the time for which the state exists, which relates to the uncertainty in time. So, the uncertainty in energy would be ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt). So for each state, the uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, but the question is about distinguishing two energy levels. So if the energy difference between them (ΔE = E2 - E1) is much larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state, then we can resolve them. Because if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainty, the measurements can reliably tell apart the two energies.

So, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainties in each energy. Wait, but each state has its own uncertainty. Wait, but if we're looking at the energy difference between the two states, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties. Or maybe it
