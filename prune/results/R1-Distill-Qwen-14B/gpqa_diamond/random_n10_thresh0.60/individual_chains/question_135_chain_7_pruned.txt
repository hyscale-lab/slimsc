Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics and the decay of a boson. Let me try to think this through. 

The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh, perhaps it's written as L = -λ f ψ̄ ψ (v + X), where f is the fermion type? Not exactly sure about the notation, but maybe it's the Yukawa coupling kind of interaction.

The boson here is X, and its mass is 6 GeV. I need to find its possible decay products at the lowest order. So, the decay would be X → something. Since X is a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term couples X to fermions.

Wait, the interaction term is written as something like λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ. So, when X is involved, each vertex would have X coupling to two fermions. So the decay would be X → f f̄.

But what fermions are possible? The allowed decays depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions. The decay can only happen if the fermion pair's combined rest mass is less than the mass of X. Because in the rest frame of X, the fermions must have enough energy to be created.

So X's mass is 6 GeV. Let's think about the masses of the possible fermions. Wait, but particles like electrons, muons, taus, and quarks (like up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) have different masses.

Electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, negligible. Muon is about 105.7 MeV, tau is about 1.78 GeV. The quarks: up and down are very light, maybe a few MeV each. Strange is around 100 MeV, charm around 1.5 GeV, bottom around 4.5 GeV, top is about 173 GeV.

So for X mass 6 GeV, the fermions that can be produced are those with mass less than 3 GeV each, because the rest mass of each fermion (times 2 for f and f̄) must be less than 6 GeV.

Wait, no, because each fermion and antifermion together have a combined rest mass of 2m. So 2m < M_X. So m < 3 GeV.

So let's list the fermion masses:

Electron: ~0.5 MeV → way below 3 GeV.

Muon: ~0.105 GeV → yes.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV → 1.78 < 3 → yes.

Quarks:

Up: ~2.2 MeV (but approx, since u and d are around same, but exact masses vary). So way below 3 GeV.

Down: same as u.

Strange: ~100 MeV → yes.

Charm: ~1.5 GeV → yes.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → wait, 4.5 is less than 3? No. 4.5 >3. So 2m would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b
