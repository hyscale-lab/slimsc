Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And resonance in this context probably refers to a particle that doesn't exist for long, so it decays quickly. The question is about finding the mean decay distance. 

The given values are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Wait, I need to convert these units properly. Oh yeah, since we're dealing with physics formulas, the units have to be consistent. Let me jot down the given data:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. I recall that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle links the two, where τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, actually, I think the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Or wait, no, more accurately, the uncertainty principle says that the product of the lifetime and the energy uncertainty (which is Γ) is on the order of ħ. So Γ * τ ≈ ħ, hence τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the particle's speed by the lifetime. So the formula would be something like L = v * τ. But wait, velocity v would depend on the energy E. Since the
