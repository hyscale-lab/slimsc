Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So, first, I think I should recall the relevant theory here. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation, right? The Boltzmann factor tells us how the number of particles in different energy states relates to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. So, the ratio (n1/n2) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as exp(ΔE/(k*T)) where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. That would mean when spots are present, the temperature is 5500 K. Without spots, it's 6000 K. 

But wait, wait a second. The problem says that when spots are present, 40% of the surface is covered. So the overall effective temperature is lower, but what about the underlying photosphere where the spots are? I think the spots are cooler regions. Oh, but the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm, maybe in this case, the spots are at a lower temperature, so when they cover part of the surface, the average temperature of the entire photosphere goes down.

But wait, the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. So the star's overall emission is lower when spots are present. But for the purpose of this question, the relevant temperature is the one in the photosphere, which is the 5500 K when spots are present.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the spots themselves emit at a lower temperature. Because when the spots are present, the star's overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are covering 40% of it. But what about the rest of the surface? Oh, I think the problem is simplifying the situation, just giving the overall Teff without considering the variations due to spots. So in this problem, it's sufficient to consider that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, and when it doesn
