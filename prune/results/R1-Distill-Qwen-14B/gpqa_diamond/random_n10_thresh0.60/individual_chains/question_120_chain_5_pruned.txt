Alright, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in space. Okay, so I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Parallax is inversely related to distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away. Oh, right, the formula is distance d ≈ 1/plx, where plx is in parsecs. So if plx increases, the star is closer, and if plx decreases, it's farther.

The question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. So if I consider a range of plx values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that the number density of stars in space is constant. So, how does this translate to the number per unit parallax?

Let me think about the relation between distance and parallax. Parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance. If I have a small change in plx, dplx, how does that relate to the change in distance dd?

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, which makes sense. But for the number of stars, maybe I can ignore the sign.

Now, the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is approximately 4πd² dd. But wait, that's for a fixed volume element, but here we're considering a range in parallax. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n (stars per unit volume) is constant. So, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV.

But the volume element in terms of distance would be dV = 4π d² dd. So for a given distance d, the number of stars in a shell of thickness dd is 4π n d² dd.

Now, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me substitute d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx, and dd = -d^2 dplx, since d = 1/plx, so dd = ( -1/plx² ) dplx.

Wait, I think I messed up the substitution. Let me think again. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d^2 dplx). Wait, let's compute dd correctly.

Take plx as a function of d: plx = 1/d. So, the differential dplx is the derivative of plx with respect to d multiplied by dd. So, dplx = (-1/d²) dd. Therefore, dd = -d² dplx. Since plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx^2). Therefore, dd = - (1/(plx²)) dplx.

But since we're interested in the magnitude, perhaps we can ignore the negative sign and write dd
