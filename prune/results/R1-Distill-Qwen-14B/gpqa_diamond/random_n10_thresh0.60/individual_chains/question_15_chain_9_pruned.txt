Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which simplifies things a bit.

The host stars are a bit different. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same size. So, same radius but different masses.

The researchers want to observe the planet that's more likely to transit, so they pick the one with higher probability. The question is about which planet has a higher transit probability.

I remember that the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. Wait, but how exactly?

The transit probability formula, as I recall, is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, where a_planet is the semi-major axis. But wait, no, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. Or wait, no, that's the transit depth. The probability is a bit different.

Wait, no, the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = (R_star / a) * (1 + something with the orbital inclination), but I think the main factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because a planet will transit only if its orbit is aligned edge-on relative to us. The probability is the ratio of the size of the star's disk to the size of the planet's orbit, in the plane of the sky.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is about the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is such that it passes in front of the star. Since the orbits are circular, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) * something else? Or is it (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by another factor.

Wait, I think the formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but again, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately (R_star / a_planet). But wait, no, that can't be right, because R_star is the radius of the star, and a_planet is the semi-major axis. But the probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the planet's orbit in the sky? Or maybe it's the ratio of the angular size of the star to the planet's orbital distance in the same units?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. The probability depends on the relative size of the star and the orbit. But more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by (R_star / a), because it's about the cross-section. Wait, no, that would be the area.

Wait, no, the probability is actually (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by something else? Or maybe not. Let me think again. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit, but that's when considering all possible orbital orientations. Wait, no, because the orbit's orientation can vary, and the probability depends on the chance that the planet's position is in front of the star.

Wait, another approach: the probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance. Because if the planet’s orbit is at a distance a, and the star's radius is R, then the "target area" where the planet can be to cause a transit is a circle with diameter R, relative to the entire orbit. So the probability is (2 R) / (2 a) ) = R/a. Wait, but that would make it R/a. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's (R/a)². Or
