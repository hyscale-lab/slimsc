Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm. Let me try to think this through.

So, the question is about the pp-III branch stopping in the Sun's core. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun that produce energy through proton-proton fusion. I think the pp-I, II, and III branches are different parts of this process. Oh right, pp-III is one of the branches where helium-3 is produced, which then contributes to the overall fusion process.

The Sun emits a lot of neutrinos, and these are detected on Earth. The flux of neutrinos is the number reaching a given area per second. The question is about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, the ratio is flux1 over flux2.

If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, what happens? Well, I think the main neutrinos from the Sun come from the proton-proton chain, particularly the pp-III branch, which produces a lot of high-energy neutrinos. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me recall. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing helium-3, and in that process, it emits neutrinos. Oh wait, right, in the pp-III branch, two protons collide to form a deuterium nucleus, and emit a positron and a neutrino. So these neutrinos are the ones detected in experiments like the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of these neutrinos would stop as well. But wait, the question says other reactions remain as they were. So, the other branches like pp-I or pp-II, if they exist, would continue normally. But I think the main neutrino emission comes from the pp-III step. So if that stops, the neutrino flux would decrease, but perhaps not entirely.

Wait, but neutrinos are also produced in other reactions, like in the CNO cycle, which occurs in higher temperatures. But I think the CNO cycle contributes a smaller fraction of the Sun's energy, so maybe the neutrinos from that are less. But the question is about the neutrinos from the pp-III branch.

So, if pp-III stops, the flux of neutrinos from that process
