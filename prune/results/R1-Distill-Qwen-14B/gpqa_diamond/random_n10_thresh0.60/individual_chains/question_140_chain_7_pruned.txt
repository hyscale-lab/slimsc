Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by trying to break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. And the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, let's take it piece by piece.

First, the reaction of X with Y. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that probably means the molecule is something like H2O, NH3, or CH4, but wait, wait—same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So, for example, if W is H2O, each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. But each H has 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe W is something like O2, but O2 has 16 g/mol, and each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, but O2 has two atoms, each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That meets the condition: same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Or maybe it's another gas like CO2? No, CO2 has three atoms. Let me think—another possibility is CO. No, that's two atoms. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, the gas W could be CO2, but let me count. CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So for each CO2 molecule, protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So same number, 22 each. So that fits. So W could be CO2.

Wait, but what reactions produce CO2? Maybe the reaction between a carbonate and acid, but let's think again.

Wait, perhaps W is CH
