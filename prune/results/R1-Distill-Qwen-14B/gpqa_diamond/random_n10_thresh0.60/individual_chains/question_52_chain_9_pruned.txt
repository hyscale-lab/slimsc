Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels depends on the temperature. Oh right, that's the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight and k is Boltzmann's constant. 

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff decreases. So when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's not (6000 K). But wait, dark spots are cooler regions on the star's surface, right? So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall observed Teff is lower. 

But the question is about the photosphere as a whole. So the photosphere's average temperature changes. So when 40% is covered by spots, the star's overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere's temperature has gone down. 

In the photosphere, when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower. So in LTE, the excitation of atoms depends on the local temperature. But wait, the problem says that the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels is observed to decrease when the star has spots. Let me think: the ratio n1/n2 would be lower when the temperature is lower. Or wait, how does the ratio depend on temperature?

The energy difference between the two levels is given by ΔE = E2 - E1. The energy is related to the wavelength by ΔE = hc/λ. The given wavelength is approximately
