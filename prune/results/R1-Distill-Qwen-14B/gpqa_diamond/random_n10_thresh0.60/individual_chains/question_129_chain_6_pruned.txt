Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully and understanding the reaction steps involved.

The problem is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let me break down each step:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided. Hint a) talks about a reaction between compound A and an unknown phosphorous ylide forming a specific structure. Hint b) gives information about the IR spectra of compounds A and E.

The options given are four possible structures for compound E. So I need to work backwards or forwards through the reactions to determine the structure.

Let me try to outline each step.

First, starting with step 1: A reacts with HCN to form B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups in a nucleophilic addition reaction. So if A is a ketone, then B would be a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, same thing. So, the reaction is likely forming a cyanohydrin. So, if A is a ketone, then B is the cyanohydrin.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation. For a cyanohydrin, the structure would have a -C(OH)CN group. Upon hydrogenation, the ketone (if any) and nitrile groups would be reduced. Wait, wait. Wait, the cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)CN. So when you hydrogenate that, the nitrile would become an amine (but wait, Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds or maybe ketones. Wait, H2 with Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but how does it affect the cyanohydrin?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. So, in the cyanohydrin, the structure is R2C(OH)CN. If we hydrogenate it, the nitrile group (CN) would become CH2NH2? Or wait, perhaps the ketone is reduced to an alcohol? Wait, no, the cyanohydrin doesn't have a ketone anymore. Hmm, maybe I need to rethink.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is of a triple bond. Wait, maybe compound B isn't a cyanohydrin. Another possibility is that HCN adds to an alkyne, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps A is a carbonyl compound, like a ketone, and
