Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But I think I can figure it out if I take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts. Let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests there's an O-H group because those usually show up as broad peaks in that region. O-H could be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, but wait, the other peaks might tell me more. Oh, there's a strong peak at 1700 and another at 1650. I remember that carbonyl groups (like C=O) absorb around 1700. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or an amide? Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a ketone or something else. Wait, but amides usually have lower wavenumbers, maybe around 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching? Hmm, but the problem says it's a strong peak, so maybe it's another carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester? Because esters have a carbonyl around 1700 and maybe another peak from the ester's C-O stretch, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the 1650
