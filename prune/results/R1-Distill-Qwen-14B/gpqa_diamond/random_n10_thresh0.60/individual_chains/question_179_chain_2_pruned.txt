Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, the question is about matrices and their properties, and then choosing the correct statement among the options A to D.

First, I need to understand what each part is about. The matrices given are W, X, Y, Z. The question is about which statement is correct based on these matrices.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. I remember that for a matrix to be unitary, its exponential (like e^X) should also be unitary if X is skew-Hermitian. Because in quantum mechanics, the time evolution operator is unitary, which means it preserves the norm of the state vector. So, if e^X is not unitary, then multiplying by it would change the norm.

Wait, but for e^X to be unitary, X must be skew-Hermitian. Let me check if X is skew-Hermitian. A matrix is skew-Hermitian if X† = -X, where † is the conjugate transpose.

So let's compute X†. X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i

Row 2: 1, 0, 1

Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So the conjugate transpose X† would be:

First element (1,1): i → conjugate is -i, so (1,1) is -i.

Wait, let me compute X† properly.

The original X matrix:

First row: [i, -1, 2i]

Second row: [1, 0, 1]

Third row: [2i, -1, -i]

So when taking the conjugate transpose, each element (i,j) becomes (j,i) and complex conjugated.

So X† would be:

Row 1: [ -i , 1, -2i ]

Row 2: [ -1 , 0, -1 ]

Row 3: [ 2i , 1, i ]

Now, let's compare X† with -X.

What's -X?

- Each element multiplied by -1.

So, original X:

Row 1: [i, -1, 2i] → -X row1: [-i,1,-2i]

Row 2: [1,0,1
