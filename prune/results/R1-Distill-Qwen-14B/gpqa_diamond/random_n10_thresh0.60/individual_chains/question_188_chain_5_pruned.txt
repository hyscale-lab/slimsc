Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal but the angles between them are all the same, which in this case are 30 degrees each. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, I think the interplanar distance formula for crystals is given by the Bragg's Law formula, but more specifically, the interplanar spacing (d) can be calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles?), but I'm not exactly sure about the exact expression for rhombohedral systems.

Wait, rhombohedral systems have a specific formula for interplanar distances. Let me think. Oh, right! The general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cosθ), where θ is the angle between the axes. Wait, but wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees here. But wait, how does the angle factor into this?

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula. I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^
