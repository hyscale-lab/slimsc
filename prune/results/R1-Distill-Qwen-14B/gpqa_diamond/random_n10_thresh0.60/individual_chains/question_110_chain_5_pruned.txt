Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO and HIRES. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But their observing capacities differ in terms of the brightness of the stars they can detect. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can see stars that are up to 17 mag. Likewise, HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag. Wait, wait, no—wait. Oh wait, the question says "brighter than" so that's higher magnitude? No, wait, no. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. Oh right! So, when they say "brighter than 17 mag", that means stars with V magnitude less than or equal to 17 are observable. Because lower magnitudes are brighter.

So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V magnitude ≤17 (since ESPRESSO can go up to 17) and apparent V magnitude ≤16 (since HIRES can go up to 16). Wait, no—wait, wait. Let me get this straight. If a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's V ≤17, because magnitude scales are inverse. So, for a star to be seen by both, it must be apparent V ≤17 (because ESPRESSO can see up to 17) and also apparent V ≤16 (because HIRES can see up to 16). Wait, but that can't be right because if a star is fainter than 16, ESPRESSO (which can go up to 17) can still see it. But wait, no, because the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star must be within the limits of both.

Wait, the maximum magnitude each can observe: ESPRESSO can see up to 17 mag, HIRES up to 16. So a star with magnitude M must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16. Because 16 is the stricter condition. Because if a star is, say, 16.5 mag, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 ≤17) but HIRES can't (because 16.5 >16). So the star must
