Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ay(φ) = aφ. The matrix operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues relate to the spin. Since a muon is a spin-1/2 particle, its spin matrices are 2x2. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2 for spin. But wait, in this case, the operator is Ay = c * S. Let me write down S first.

Matrix S:
Row 1: 0  -i
Row 2: i  0

Wait, does this look familiar? Oh yeah, this is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Wait, the Pauli matrices are usually σx, σy, σz. Let me check. The Pauli Y matrix is actually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, σy.

But then, the operator Ay is c times σy. Since c is h/(4π), that's the same as (h/(4π)) * σy.

But wait, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply them by a scalar, the eigenvalues would be scaled accordingly. Let me think about the eigenvalues of Ay.

The eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay would be ±c, so ±h/(4π). But wait, wait a second. Because the operator for spin is usually something like (ħ/2)σ. Oh wait, because the spin operator is (ħ/2)σ for each component. So the spin component S_y would be (ħ/2)σy. Wait, but in this problem, c is h/(4π), and I'm not sure about the units here. Let me check
