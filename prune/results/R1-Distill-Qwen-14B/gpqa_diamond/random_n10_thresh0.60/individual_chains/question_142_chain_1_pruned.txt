Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix of a qubit. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum computing, but let me try to work through this.

The question gives me the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So, first, I need to figure out what this particular rho represents.

Hmm, the expression looks like a diagonal matrix. Let me write it out. The |0><0| term is a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere, and |1><1| is 1 in (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. So when I add them, each diagonal element becomes 1. Then I multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal is 1/2. So rho is a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal.

Wait, right, that's the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. So rho = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. I think another way to write that is (I)/2, where I is the identity matrix. So that's a maximally mixed state because it's diagonal and all the diagonal elements are equal. 

But the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Oh, right, qubit states can be represented as vectors in a 2D space, but when it comes to density matrices, they're in a higher-dimensional space. Wait, no, maybe it's about the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is for pure states, but density matrices can describe mixed states. For a single qubit, the density matrix is 2x2 and Hermitian. The Bloch vector (r) is a way to represent the state. For a density matrix rho, the Bloch vector r is given by r = 2 (rho - I/2). So to find r, we can compute this.

Let me compute that. Rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write the matrix:

rho = [[0.5, 0],
       [0, 0.5]]

So I is the identity matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So I/2 is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]]. Subtracting I/2 from rho, we get rho - I/2 = [[0,0],[0,0]]. Then, 2 times that is still zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The Bloch vector for a density matrix is r = 2 (rho - (I/2)). So for rho = I/2, rho - I/2 is zero matrix, so r is zero. So the state is at the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is the completely mixed state. 

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C. 

But wait, another approach: for a two-level system, the density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I set
