Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative motion and light, it's all about how different frames of reference perceive things. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. Oh wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so that's convenient.

Wait, I remember something about the velocity of light in a medium. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But wait, that's the speed in the medium when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the medium itself (the glass) is moving. So I can't just use v = 1/n, because the glass's motion affects the observed speed.

So I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, perhaps using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add velocities classically. But wait, the problem doesn't specify that v is a significant fraction of c. Hmm, but given that the options include terms with v and n, maybe it's not using relativity. Or perhaps it's an approximation
