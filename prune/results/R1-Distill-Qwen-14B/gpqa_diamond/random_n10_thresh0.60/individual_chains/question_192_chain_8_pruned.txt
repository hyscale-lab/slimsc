Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and both L and l are greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. 

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that conductors have some properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, but now there's a charge inside the cavity, that should induce some charges on the conductor's surfaces.

Wait, I think when a charge is inside a conducting cavity, it induces equal and opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, wait. The conductor is uncharged, right? So the total charge on the conductor would be zero. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface must have -q to cancel it, and then the outer surface would have +q to balance because the conductor's total charge is zero. Or wait, no. Wait, no, the conductor was uncharged initially. So when you place +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Then the outer surface must have +q because the total conductor's charge is zero. So the outer surface has +q.

But wait, how does this all work? Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. We put +q inside the cavity. The cavity is inside the conductor. So the conductor's inner surface (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q. Because the inner -q plus the outer +q gives the conductor a net charge of zero. That makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So, what's the electric field there? I remember that the electric
