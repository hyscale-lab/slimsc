Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. Heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. Oh wait, KOH is a strong base, and when it's heated with vicinal dihalides, it typically does an elimination reaction, like an E2, forming an alkene. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, right? Because the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

So the product 1 would likely be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a carbonyl stretch. Hmm, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it's not an elimination but something else. Oh wait, KOH can cause ring-opening in some cases, like with epoxides, but adamantane doesn't have a ring that would open. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms; perhaps it's undergoing dehydrohalogenation twice, leading to a diene. But why the IR peak at 1720?

Wait, 1720 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. So maybe it's more of a substitution. Oh, wait! Maybe the reaction is a double substitution, replacing Br with something else. But KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation (elimination), but if that's the case, why the IR peak? Or perhaps the product is a diketone? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the NMR data: the product 1 has a 1H NMR spectrum with 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a quartet or triplet of an -O-CH2- group. Or perhaps an -OCH2O- structure. Oh, wait, maybe it's an epoxide? No, wait, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Or maybe it's an ether. Alternatively, maybe it's
