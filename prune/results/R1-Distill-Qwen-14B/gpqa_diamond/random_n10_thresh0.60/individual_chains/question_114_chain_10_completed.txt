Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the right reagents A and B from the given options. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and Reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. Then, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with Reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First reaction: Butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think this is a nucleophilic substitution or addition reaction. Wait, but ketones usually don't undergo nucleophilic substitution like aliphatic amines or something. Oh wait, maybe it's an enolate formation. Or perhaps it's an example of a cyanide acting as a nucleophile in some kind of addition.

Wait, but butanone (butan-2-one) is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with NaCN, which is sodium cyanide. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group. So, the carbonyl oxygen would be attacked by the cyanide ion. But wait, in ketones, the carbonyl is less reactive than in aldehydes because the adjacent R groups are electron donating (like alkyl groups), making the carbonyl less electrophilic. So maybe the reaction here isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the ketone is being converted into an alcohol or something else.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. The nitrile group (CN) is at the same carbon as the hydroxyl (OH) group and two methyl groups? Wait, no. Let me think. The structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when that reacts with NaCN, perhaps it's an addition followed by something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a hydrocyanation. But hydrocyanation usually refers to adding HCN to a triple bond, like in alkynes or alkenes. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's think about the product. It's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The structure would be something like (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons. So the nitrile is at position 1, and the hydroxy is at position 2. So the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps not.

Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have four carbons in the chain. Let me number them: position 1 is the CN, position 2 is the OH and methyl groups. So structure: CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN? Or perhaps CH2(CH2CN)-C(OH)(CH3)-CH3? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So the main chain is four carbons: the first is CH2CN, then the second is C(OH)(CH3), then two CH3 groups? No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)C(OH)(CH2CN)CH3? Wait, that would make it 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Or maybe:

Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so the nitrile is the first carbon. So 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would be on the second carbon. So:

CH2CN-CH(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be longer than four. Maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. So the structure is (CH3)2-C(OH)-CH2-CN. So four carbons in total: the nitrile is on C1, the hydroxy and two methyl groups on C2, then a CH2 and a CH3?

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let's think about the reaction. Butanone reacting with NaCN and reagent A gives that product. What's the typical reaction of ketones with NaCN?

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a case of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with HCN (or CN-) to form a compound where the nitrile and an alcohol group are added to the carbonyl carbon. So, for example, a ketone would react with HCN to form a cyanohydrin, which is a geminal diol (though one is OH and the other is CN).

So, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Reacting with HCN (or CN- in the presence of acid?) would add H and CN across the carbonyl, leading to (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Oh wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, so that suggests the chain is longer. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't direct. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a nitrile via substitution. But substitution in a ketone doesn't make much sense since ketones are not typically good at undergoing SN2 reactions. So probably not that.

Another approach: Reagent A could be an acid, like H3O+. Because in the cyanohydrin formation, HCN (which is a weak acid) can be generated in situ by adding an acid to NaCN. Wait, NaCN is a salt of a weak acid (HCN) and a strong base (NaOH, but actually, NaCN is more like CN^- plus H+ because HCN is weak). So if you have NaCN and you add an acid (like H3O+), you get HCN. Then, the HCN can react with the ketone.

So, for the first step, Reagent A is H3O+. That would make sense because HCN is a better nucleophile than CN^-.

Now, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed by the addition of HCN across the carbonyl group. So, butan-2-one plus HCN gives (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, that's propanenitrile derivative, not butanenitrile. So maybe I'm missing the chain length. Alternatively, perhaps the product is butanenitrile derivative with a four-carbon chain. Hmm.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. Adding HCN would add a CN group, so the product would have four carbons. So the product would have four carbons: (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No. Wait, wait: butanone is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. But the product given is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. So perhaps the initial structure is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH2CH3? No, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have four carbons in total. So the nitrile is on the first carbon, then the hydroxyl and methyl on the second, and then two more carbons? Or maybe the structure is (CH2CN)CH(OH)(CH3)2. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reaction.

In any case, the first step probably involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from the ketone, which would require HCN. So, to generate HCN from NaCN, you need an acid. So Reagent A is H3O+.

So in the first reaction, A is H3O+. So looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So, first reaction A is H3O+ in options A and B.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with Reagent B and H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH).

So, what reagents do that? Nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids. Common oxidizing agents for this are strong acids like HCl or H2SO4 under certain conditions, or other oxidizing agents like KMnO4 or others. But in the presence of water, what would do that?

Wait, the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile. Wait, but nitriles can undergo hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, with H2O and heat, nitriles can hydrolyze to carboxylic acids. Alternatively, in basic conditions, they form carboxylates which can be acidified.

So, for the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, the reagent would probably be a strong acid, like HCl, along with water and heat.

Alternatively, perhaps using a strong oxidizing agent. But in the presence of H2O, maybe it's a hydrolysis.

Wait, the second reaction is with Reagent B and H2O. So, the conditions are aqueous. So, to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, one way is hydrolysis, typically under acidic conditions. So, the reagent would be an acid, like HCl. Or perhaps another acid like acetic acid.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, while acetic acid is a weak acid. Which one is needed for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids?

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic conditions with H2O. For example, using H2SO4 as a catalyst and heating with water. Alternatively, using HCl as a reagent. Another method is using a mixture of HCl and water with some oxidizing agent.

Wait, the specific reaction here is the conversion of nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile (R-C≡N) becomes R-COOH.

The typical reagents for this are: 

- Under acidic conditions, using HCl and water, with heating.

So perhaps B is HCl.

Looking at the options, if A is H3O+, then Reagent B could be HCl (option A) or CH3COOH (option B). So, in the second reaction, using HCl (B=HCl) would make sense for the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid.

So, putting it together:

First reaction: NaCN and H3O+ (A=H3O+) to form the cyanohydrin.

Second reaction: nitrile group to carboxylic acid with HCl (B=HCl).

So the correct option would be A) A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → Correct.

Option B: B=acetic acid → Not strong enough for hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait. Are there other ways to hydrolyze nitriles? Like using a mixture of water and acid, perhaps without adding HCl separately? Hmm, but in the reaction, Reagent B is used along with H2O. So, if B is HCl, then you add HCl and H2O. Alternatively, B could be an acid like CH3COOH, but HCl is a stronger acid and more likely to drive the hydrolysis to completion.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Can acetic acid (CH3COOH) function as the acid in the hydrolysis of nitriles? I think that in some cases, nitriles can be hydrolyzed with dilute H2SO4 or in the presence of a weak acid, but the reaction might require higher temperatures and longer times. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of H+ is sufficient.

Alternatively, another approach: the first reaction uses H3O+ as A, which is correct for forming the cyanohydrin. The second reaction requires the nitrile to be oxidized. Wait, but oxidation of nitriles to acids usually requires strong oxidizing agents. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is first converted to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. But in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it's more likely a hydrolysis.

Wait, but no, in the second reaction, the nitrile is in a molecule that already has a hydroxyl group. Let me look at the structure again.

The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, the structure is something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-C(OH)(CH2CH2CN)-CH3? No, perhaps it's more like:

The butanenitrile part is four carbons. So, the structure is (Ph group attached at position 2?), but maybe that's not important. The key point is that the nitrile group is adjacent to a hydroxyl group. So, when you hydrolyse the nitrile, perhaps under acidic conditions, the nitrile becomes a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps in the presence of HCl (a strong acid), the nitrile group is hydrolysed to a carboxylic acid group, giving the product.

So, Reagent B is HCl. So, looking back at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

So, the correct option is A.


The problem involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the suitable reagents A and B from the given options.

### Reaction 1: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile  
Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻). The product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, is a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation occurs when a ketone reacts with HCN, where the hydroxyl (OH) and nitrile (CN) groups are added to the carbonyl carbon. To generate HCN from NaCN, an acid is required. Therefore, Reagent A must be an acid, specifically H₃O⁺, which provides the necessary H⁺ to protonate CN⁻ and form HCN.

### Reaction 2: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid  
In this reaction, the nitrile group (CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). This transformation typically occurs through hydrolysis of the nitrile group under acidic conditions. Strong acids like HCl are commonly used for this purpose, as they provide the H⁺ necessary for the reaction to proceed. Reagent B is therefore identified as HCl.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl):**  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions. H₃O⁺ is needed for cyanohydrin formation in Reaction 1, and HCl is suitable for nitrile hydrolysis in Reaction 2.  
- **Option B (A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH):**  
  While H₃O⁺ is correct for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and less effective for nitrile hydrolysis compared to HCl.  
- **Option C (A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl):**  
  NaHSO₃ is not suitable for Reaction 1, as it does not generate HCN.  
- **Option D (A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH):**  
  NaHSO₃ is incorrect for Reaction 1, and CH₃COOH is not strong enough for Reaction 2.

### Conclusion:
The correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which correspond to **Option A**.
