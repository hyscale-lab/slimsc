Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are equal in length, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Hmm, but wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms along the lattice parameter, right? So I think the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms here.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula I remember is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)) but wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Oh wait, no, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, I think each angle might be considered. Or perhaps in a rhombohedral system, since
