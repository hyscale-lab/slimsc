Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually a conjugate base, attacks the beta carbon, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

Let me tackle the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate, right? Wait, no, actually, in the presence of a base like NaOEt, dimethyl malonate would deprotonate to form a strong nucleophilic enolate. So the enolate would attack the beta position of the other carbonyl compound.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3, with a p-tolyl group on C3. The structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl here is CH2-CH(COOR).

When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), it would form a new bond there. Wait, no. Wait, the attacking nucleophile is the enolate, so wait, which way does the addition go? Oh, right, the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So in the case of the given acrylate,
