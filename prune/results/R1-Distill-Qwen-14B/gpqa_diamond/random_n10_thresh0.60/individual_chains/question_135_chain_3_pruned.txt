Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, the question is about the possible decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that in particle physics, a boson can decay into fermions if the interaction term in the Lagrangian allows it. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait. Let me parse that. So the interaction term involves the fermion fields ψ_f and the boson field X. 

Wait, actually, the term seems a bit off. Maybe I should read it again. Oh, perhaps it's written as -λf times the product of the fermion fields and X? Or maybe it's a Yukawa coupling kind of term. Oh right, the standard Yukawa interaction is L = -g ψ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So the interaction is between two fermions and a boson. So this would imply that the boson X can mediate interactions between two fermions. So when X decays, it can split into a pair of fermions.

Wait, but fermions have to come in pairs because they're matter and antimatter. So each decay would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

Now, the boson's mass is 6 GeV. So to find allowed decay modes, I need to consider which fermions have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because in a decay, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So the possible fermions f would be those where 2m_f < 6 GeV. Because each fermion would have mass m_f, so two of them would be 2m_f.

What are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think. The fermion masses (in GeV) are approximately:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Wait, but the X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where 2m_f < 6 GeV is allowed. Let's list each fermion and see if their sum is under 6 GeV.
