Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We have a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. They're asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is [CaEDTA]^2-, right? So when EDTA binds to Ca²+, it forms this complex.

I think the key here is the formation constant, K. The formation constant is a measure of the stability of the complex. A high K value means the complex is very stable, so the reaction tends to go to completion.

The reaction for the formation of the Ca-EDTA complex is probably something like:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
And the formation constant K is given by:
K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Wait, but wait, what's the initial concentration here? The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M initially. But wait, does that mean all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex? Or is some of it dissociated?

Well, the formation constant is very large (5e10), which is a big number. That suggests that the complex is very stable, so the dissociation of the complex is minimal. So most of the Ca²+ is in the form of the complex, and the free Ca²+ concentration is very low.

So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the total concentration of calcium (both free and bound) is 0.02 M, since each complex has one Ca²+.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in solution, which is the free [Ca²+]. Because the complex is stable, very little calcium is dissociated. So the free [Ca²+] should be very small.

Let me think about the expression again. Let's denote [CaEDTA^2-] as C, which is 0.02 M. Then, the formation constant K is
