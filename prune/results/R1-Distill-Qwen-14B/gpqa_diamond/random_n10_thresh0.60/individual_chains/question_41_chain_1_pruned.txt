Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's think. The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, we have to consider how the velocity of light within that medium transforms. But I'm a bit confused about whether it's the medium moving or the light. Oh right, because the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass. So the speed of light in the glass is normally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But how does the glass's motion affect this?

I think this is related to the concept of relative velocity. Like, if the glass is moving, then an observer in the lab would see the light's velocity differently. But wait, light's speed in a vacuum is always c according to Einstein's theory, but here the light is in a medium, so it's slowerâ€”v_light = c/n.

Wait, no, that's the speed in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass is moving. So I need to find the speed in the lab frame. So it's a problem of adding velocities when the medium is moving.

I remember that in special relativity, velocities don
