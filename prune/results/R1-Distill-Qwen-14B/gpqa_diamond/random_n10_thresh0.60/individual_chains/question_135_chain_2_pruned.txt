Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think this through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I remember that the general form of an interaction term between a scalar boson and fermions is something like λ X ψ ψ. So this seems to fit that structure. Here, λ_f is a coupling constant for each fermion type f.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So, the question is about the allowed decay modes of X at the lowest order. That means we're looking for decay channels where X can decay into a pair of particles, say f and f-bar, where f is a fermion.

In particle physics, for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. So, the condition is m_X >= 2 m_f. So, I need to figure out which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV).

Wait, but wait a second. What are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them out. The fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau), and neutrinos. But neutrinos are super light, almost massless, so their masses can be ignored here.

So, let me jot down the approximate masses:

- Up quark: ~2 MeV
- Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark: ~100 MeV
- Charm quark: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark: ~4.5-5 GeV
- Top quark: way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV
- Tau: ~1.777 GeV

Wait, the tau is about 1.777 GeV, so half of X's mass (3 GeV) is more than that. So for each fermion, 2m_f should be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So let's go through each possible fermion pair:

1. Up quark: 2m_u ~ 4 MeV << 6 GeV. So X can decay into u and u-bar.
2. Down quark: 2m_d ~ 8 MeV <<6 GeV. So d and d-bar are allowed.
3. Strange quark: 2m_s ~ 200 MeV <<6 GeV. So s and s-bar are allowed.
4. Charm quark: 2m_c ~ 3 GeV (since m_c is about 1.5 GeV). 3 GeV is equal to X's mass, so X can decay into c c-bar. Wait, because 2m_c = 3 GeV which is exactly X's mass. So equal is allowed, right? So yes, that's allowed.
5. Bottom quark: 2m_b ~ around 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b and b-bar.
6. Top quark: way too heavy. So no.

For leptons:

- Electron: 2m_e is negligible, so yes.
- Muon: 2m_mu ~ 0.2 GeV <6 GeV. So mu+ mu- is allowed.
- Tau: 2m_tau ~ 3.55 GeV <6 GeV. So tau+ tau- is allowed. Wait, 2*1.777 is ~3.554 GeV, which is less than 6, so yes.

Wait, but wait: the tau is 1.777 GeV per particle. So 2m_tau is about 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

What about neutrinos? Well, their masses are negligible, but the interaction term in the Lagrangian is given. Wait, the Lagrangian here shows ψ_f, which is a fermion field. But if the interaction
