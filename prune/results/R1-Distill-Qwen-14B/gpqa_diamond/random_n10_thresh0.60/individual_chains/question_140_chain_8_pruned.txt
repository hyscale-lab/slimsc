Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X. X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Another part says that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and there's a mention of an isotope being heavier.

Hmm, I think I should start by breaking down each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reactionâ€”maybe a strong acid reacting with a metal? Or perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid? Wait, but the gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, CO2 has 12+16=28, but protons (6 for C and 8 for O) would be 14. Neutrons? C has 6, O has 8 each. So each molecule of CO2 has 6+8*2=22 neutrons? No, wait, each atom has its own. So per molecule, C has 6 neutrons (since C is usually C-12, 6 protons, 6 neutrons), each O has 8. So CO2 would have 6 + 8*2 = 22 neutrons, and protons would be 6 + 8*2=22. Oh! Wait, that's 22 each. So protons and neutrons in the molecule are equal. So W is CO2? That makes sense.

If W is CO2, then the reaction must be between a carbonate (Y could be a carbonate?) and something else. Or maybe Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, but if Y is a liquid, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Alternatively, if X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid, Y could be sulfuric acid or something. Wait, but the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. So maybe X is a metal carbonate (like Na2CO3) and Y is an acid. But wait, when a carbonate reacts with an acid, you get CO2 gas, water, and a salt. But if Y is an acid,
