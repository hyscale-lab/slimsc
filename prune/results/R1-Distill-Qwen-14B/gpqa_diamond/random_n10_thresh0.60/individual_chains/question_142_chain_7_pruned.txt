Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Hmm, wait, I remember that density matrices can describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. If this was |0><0|, that would be the pure state |0>, but here it's a combination. Oh right, if you have a density matrix that's a sum of projectors times 1/2, it's like a classical mixture of the states.

So, the state is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Wait, but what does that mean geometrically? I'm trying to visualize the Bloch sphere here. The Bloch sphere is the geometrical representation of a qubit's state. Pure states are points on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The density matrix ρ given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that. The computational basis states |0> and |1> correspond to the standard basis vectors. Each |i><i| is a projector onto that state. So, adding them gives a 2x2 identity matrix, but multiplied by 1/2. Wait, because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) I, where I is the identity matrix.

So ρ equals (1/2) times the identity matrix. Hmm, what does that mean in terms of the Bloch sphere? The Bloch vector for a density matrix is defined as r = [x, y, z], and the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if ρ is (I + r·σ)/2, then in this case, ρ is (I)/2. That would mean r·σ must be zero. So r is (0,0,0). Because when you set r to zero, the term disappears.

Wait, so the vector r is the origin in the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because a completely mixed state has no coherence and is equally likely to be found in |0> or |1>. So it's the maximally mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, that's the center, which is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which matches. So the correct answer should be C.

I think that's it. The geometrical position is the origin because it's a completely mixed state.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. For a maximally mixed state like this, the density matrix corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere, which is the origin \
