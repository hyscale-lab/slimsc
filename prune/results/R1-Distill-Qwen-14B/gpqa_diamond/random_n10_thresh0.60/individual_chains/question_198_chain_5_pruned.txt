Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex forms. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) where n is 1 to 4.

Wait, the question specifically asks about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato means two thiocyanate ions. So, the blue complexes are Co(SCN)_2Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. Hmm, I remember that when metal ions form complexes with ligands, the stability constants (beta) come into play. 

So, the setup is that we're dealing with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) in solution. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, the stability constants are for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+? I think each beta represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is for the monomeric complex, β2 for the di, and so on. Or is it the other way around? Actually, no, I think the order is that β1 is the first step, adding one SCN. So, β1 is for [CoSCN]^+ perhaps, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+? Or maybe I should double-check. 

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So
