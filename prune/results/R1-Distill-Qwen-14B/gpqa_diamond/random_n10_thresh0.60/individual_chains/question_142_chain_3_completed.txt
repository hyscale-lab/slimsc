Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So a pure state would have a density matrix that's a projection operator, like |psi><psi|, but a mixed state is a statistical mixture of multiple pure states.

Let me write down the given rho. So rho = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I think each term is a projector onto |0> and |1> respectively. So adding them together and multiplying by 1/2, this must represent a classical mixture of the two basis states. Because each term is orthogonal, right?

Now, I'm trying to remember how this translates into the Bloch sphere representation. Because for single qubits, the density matrix can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector describes the state as a vector in 3D space, where pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states inside.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space. So if I can express the given rho in this form, I can find r.

The given rho is 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute what |0><0| and |1><1| look like in terms of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, I remember that |0><0| can be written as (I + σ_z)/2. Similarly, |1><1| is (I - σ_z)/2. So let me substitute that into rho.

So substituting:

rho = (1/2)[ (I + σ_z)/2 + (I - σ_z)/2 ]

Let me compute that. Expanding the terms inside the brackets:

= (1/2)[ (I + σ_z + I - σ_z)/2 ]
= (1/2)[ (2I)/2 ]
= (1/2)(I)
= I/2

Wait, that's interesting. So rho is equal to the identity matrix divided by two. So rho = I/2.

But wait, in the Bloch sphere representation, rho is (I + r·σ)/2, right? So if rho is I/2, then (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtract I/2 from both sides: (r·σ)/2 = 0. So r·σ must be zero. That implies that r is the zero vector.

Because if r is all zeros, then r·σ is zero, so rho becomes I/2. So the state is completely mixed, meaning it's the maximally mixed state, which for a qubit is the state (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). 

Let me double-check. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's the same as I/2. The identity matrix over 2 is indeed the maximally mixed state. So its position on the Bloch sphere is the origin because r is zero. So the correct answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a 3D vector describing the state in the Bloch sphere.

Substituting the given \(\rho\) into this form, we note that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\). Comparing this with the general expression, we find that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which lies at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which matches option C.

Answer: C
