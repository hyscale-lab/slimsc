Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again. So, there's this substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas has the same number of neutrons and protons, which probably means it's a noble gas since noble gases often form diatomic molecules, but wait, the same number of neutrons and protons—so the molecule would have the same number of each. Let me think: each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Oh, like maybe carbon-12? No, wait, but gas W is a molecule. Wait, maybe it's an isotope where each atom has the same n and p. Like, for example, if each atom is carbon-12, but that's a molecule of two carbons? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's a molecule like O2 or N2? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something like Argon? But Argon is monoatomic. Wait, another thought: if the gas is H2, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So n and p are not the same. Or maybe He? He is monoatomic, each has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (for He-4). Oh wait, but if the molecule is He, it's monoatomic, so each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So for He, each atom has same number of protons and neutrons. So if W is He gas, then each He atom has 2p and 2n. So the molecule would be He, which is monoatomic. But the problem says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm. Wait, maybe W is a molecule of two atoms of an element where each atom has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think of elements. Let's list elements where their atoms have same protons and neutrons. So for example, carbon-12 has 6 p and 6 n. So if each atom is carbon-12, then a molecule of C2 would have 2*(6+6) =24 neutrons and 12 protons? No, that's not same. Wait, no—each atom of C-12 has 6p and 6n. So two atoms would
