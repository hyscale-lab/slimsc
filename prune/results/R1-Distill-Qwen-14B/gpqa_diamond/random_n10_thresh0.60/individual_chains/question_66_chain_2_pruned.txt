Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each one.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a theory that includes all possible operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries, but with higher dimension terms. So what symmetries are part of the Standard Model? Well, the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, which is the combination of rotations and boosts. Lorentz symmetry is fundamental; if SMEFT is an effective theory, I guess it has to maintain that because the SM does. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Wait, what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But I think in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the SM. The SM has Poincare symmetry, so SMEFT should too. Oh wait, but wait, SMEFT is an effective theory, so does it include all Poincare symmetries? Let me think. The effective theory is built from local operators, which are constructed covariantly. So yes, they must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So option 2 (Poincare) is also a symmetry that operators must respect.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry includes translations. In SMEFT, the operators are constructed from local fields, so the terms are local, meaning they must respect Poincare? Or is it that the theory as a whole respects Poincare, but individual operators are built in a way that respects it? Hmm, but the question is about what each operator must respect. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, all operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

Now, what about CP symmetry (option 3)? I recall that CP symmetry is not a symmetry of the Standard Model. For example, the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix introduces CP violation. So in the SM, CP isn't a symmetry. Therefore, SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. Operators in SMEFT can violate CP. So option 3 is not a must; it's not one of the symmetries that all operators must respect.

Lastly, CPT symmetry (option 4). I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. It's a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The SM is CPT symmetric. So any effective theory derived from the SM must respect CPT symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it all together: which options are correct? The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4) must be respected. Wait, but what about Poincare? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. So if operators must respect Poincare, they must automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is whether both 1 and 2 are correct, or just 2.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are built in a way that respects the symmetries of the SM. SM respects Poincare
