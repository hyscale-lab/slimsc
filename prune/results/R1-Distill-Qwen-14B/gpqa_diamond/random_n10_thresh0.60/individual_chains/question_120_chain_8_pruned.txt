Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are inverse powers of plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs)... so if a star is closer, its parallax is larger. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So higher plx means closer stars.

The question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So, for a given range of plx, like from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, does that mean their distances are uniformly distributed? Or is it uniform on the sky but not necessarily in distance? Wait, the question says uniformly distributed in the sky. So maybe it's about their positions on the celestial sphere, not their distances. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, I think when they say uniformly distributed in the sky, it generally refers to their spatial distribution in the universe as seen from Earth. So, uniform in all directions, but not necessarily uniform in distance. Wait, but if they're uniformly distributed in space, that's different. Oh, but wait, the question is about the distribution in the sky, which might imply that the number per unit solid angle is the same. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

So, considering the parallax, which depends
