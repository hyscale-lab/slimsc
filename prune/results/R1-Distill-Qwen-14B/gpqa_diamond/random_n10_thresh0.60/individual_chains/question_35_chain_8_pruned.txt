Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum in quantum mechanics involves some matrices, right? Let me think.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π). Oh wait, S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). So, that matrix S looks familiar. Wait, isn't that the Pauli Y matrix or something like that? Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and they're used in spin systems.

Wait, I think the Pauli Y matrix is actually [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly what S is. So, S is the Pauli Y matrix. So, A_y is c times the Pauli Y matrix.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The options are given, and I need to figure out which statement is correct.

First, I should write down A_y. So, A_y = c * S. Since S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then A_y would be [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. Let's substitute c = h/(4π). So, A_y becomes [[0, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0]].

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0. Let's set that up.

The matrix A_y - λ I would be:

[ -λ , -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -λ ]

The determinant is ( -λ * -λ ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )

Which is λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h^2)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So, it becomes λ² - [ (1) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] = 0.

So λ² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π). Wait, but wait, because when I compute the determinant, the
