Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Alright, let's read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A to D.

Hmm. So, I remember that when dealing with charges and their energy, it's usually related to potential energy. Oh right, the potential energy between point charges. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but in a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So that's going to be a combination of all the interactions between each pair of charges.

But wait, the problem says 12 charges are at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the setup is like this: one charge at the center (point P), and 12 others equally distant from it. So each of the 12 is at 2 m from P.

So I need to calculate the potential energy of the system. Since the system is isolated, I think the minimum energy would be when all the charges are placed in a way that minimizes the potential energy. But wait, since some charges are fixed, maybe I can't move them, so that affects the calculation.

Wait, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So I can't move the positions of these charges; they're fixed. So I just have to compute the potential energy of this configuration.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy of this system." So perhaps I'm considering the potential energy, which is a state function. Since the system is fixed, maybe the potential energy is fixed as well. So the minimum is just that value.

So the system consists of 13 charges of 2e each. So each charge is 2 times the elementary charge, which is 2 * 1.6e-19 C, so 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at a distance of 2 m from P. So each of the other 12 charges is 2 meters away from the charge at P. But how about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Because each of those 12 is at 2 m from P, but what's the distance between each other? If all 12 are at 2 meters from P, perhaps they form a spherical shell around P, but their exact arrangement might affect their mutual distances. But wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, but in terms of potential energy, I think we can model this as each charge being at 2 m from P, but the mutual distances between the 12 charges are perhaps all being 2 m? Wait no, that's not right. If you have 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2 m, their mutual distances vary. For a spherical arrangement, each charge's distance to others depends on their positions. But if the problem doesn't specify any constraints beyond being at 2 m from P, perhaps we can only account for their distance from P and not their mutual distances. Or maybe the problem expects me to assume that the 12 charges are all at a distance 2 m from P, and that the distances between any two of them are very large, so their mutual potential energy is negligible. Wait, but that probably isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not between the 12 themselves. But that seems unlikely because the system's total potential energy includes all pairs.
