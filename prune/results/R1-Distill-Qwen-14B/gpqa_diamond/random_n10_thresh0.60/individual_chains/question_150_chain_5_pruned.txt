Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's eight carbons, nine hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, X is 0, so it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. That's (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from maybe a ring and some double bonds or other rings.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). A triplet near 10 ppm? That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's a triplet, maybe it's coupled with two protons. Or maybe it's an acidic proton, but aldehyde makes more sense here.

Then, 6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests two equivalent protons, possibly para-substituted aromatic rings. The next is 6.51 ppm (d, 2H), also a doublet. Maybe that's another aromatic ring, perhaps with substituents that cause this splitting.

Then 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. Maybe some vinyl protons or adjacent to an electronegative group. Or maybe they're part of a conjugated system with neighboring protons that cause them to be broad.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H). A doublet in the 3.5-3.7 range. Maybe some CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Like an ether or an ester. The doublet suggests each H is next to one other H. So perhaps it's CH2 connected to something else, like OCH2.

Putting this together, the molecule might have an aromatic ring, another aromatic ring perhaps, and some substituents. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about
