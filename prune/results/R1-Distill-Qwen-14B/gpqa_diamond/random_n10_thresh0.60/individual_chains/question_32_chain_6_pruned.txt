Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the atomic mass number A is 6.

The question is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases significantly due to relativistic effects. The formula I think I need is the total energy of a relativistic particle, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the equation. Let me compute gamma first.

So v = 0.96c. Let's calculate v²/c²: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is approximately 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: since 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

Now, the next step is to find the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, so the mass I need is the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, no, wait: the atomic mass of a nucleus is roughly A * u, where A is the mass number. So for Li-6, A=6. So m = 6 u.

But wait, I should get the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, I can look up the exact value, but since I don't have that, I'll proceed with 6 u. Wait, wait, I think the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.012 u, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, we'll just use 6 u as an approximation. Hmm, but maybe I should be more precise. Let me think: the exact value could matter here.

Wait, the standard atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. So the rest mass energy is m*c². The rest mass energy E_rest is m * c², so for 6 u, it would be 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg * c
