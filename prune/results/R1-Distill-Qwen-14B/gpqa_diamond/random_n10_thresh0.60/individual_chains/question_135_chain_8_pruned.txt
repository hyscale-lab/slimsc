Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term between the bosonic field X and fermions. It looks like this: L(y) = -λf ψ_fbar(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I can parse this. So the interaction is between the boson X and some fermions ψ_f. The term seems to imply that the fermions are charged under this interaction, maybe Yukawa-type coupling.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing various fermion pairs.

Alright, so kinematically allowed means that the energy (mass) of X must be sufficient to produce the fermion pair. Each decay would require that the rest mass of the fermions times two (since they come in pairs) is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

So, first, I should list all possible fermions that can be produced, considering their masses. Let's remember the approximate masses of the fermions:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005
