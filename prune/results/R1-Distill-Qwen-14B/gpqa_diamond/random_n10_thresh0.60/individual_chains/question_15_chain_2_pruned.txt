Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, meaning when it passes in front of its star from our point of view. 

The setup says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, orbital period is the time it takes to orbit the star. So Planet_1 is closer to its star since it has a shorter period. 

The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of the one with Planet_2. Oh, and the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but same radii, so that's a key point. 

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how do I calculate the probability? I think the formula is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, no, that's the condition for transit. The probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star to the size of the orbit. Or maybe the probability is inversely proportional to the orbital distance? Because if the planet is closer (smaller a), the chance that its orbital plane intersects our line of sight is higher.

Let me try to recall the formula. I think the transit probability (p) is given by p = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since both orbits are circular (e = 0), that simplifies to p = R_star / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) → p = R_star / a. Wait, but wait, no, that's not right. Or maybe it's p = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is usually much smaller than R_star, so maybe it's approximated as R_star / a.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: the probability of transit is the ratio of the size of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the size of the planet's orbit. So that's (R_star) / (a) multiplied by something else? Or perhaps it's (R_star / a) squared? Or maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough. 

Wait, I think the formula for the probability of transit is (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, this is approximately R_star / a. So the probability is proportional to R_star divided by the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But wait, the semi-major axis a relates to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. Oh right, Kepler's law says that (a^3)/(M_star) = (G * P^2)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3). 

So, let's compute a for each planet. 

Let me define some variables. Let me call M1 the mass of Planet_1's star, M2 the mass of Planet_2's star. According to the problem, M1 = 2 * M2.

The orbital period of Planet_1 is P1, and Planet_2 is P2, and P1 = P2 / 3. So P2 is three times longer than P1.

So, for each planet, a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3). So for Planet_1, a1 proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2²/9)) )^(1/3). Because P1 = P2/3, so P1 squared is P2²/9.

So, a1 is proportional to (2 M2 * (P2² /9)) )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) * M2 * P2² )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3) = cube root(2/9) * a2^(1/1), wait no, because a2 is (M2 * P2²)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. a1 = (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2) * (P2² / 9) )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) * M2 * P2² ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

Similarly, a2 is (M2 * P2²)^(1/3). 

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So the ratio a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3). Let's compute that numerically. 2/9 is about 0.2222. The cube root of that is approximately 0.606. So a1 is about 60.6% of a2. So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star, so it's closer.

Wait, wait, let's think again. Planet_1 has a period P1 = P2 /3. So if you have a star with higher mass, the same period would correspond to a smaller a. So Planet_1, with the same period as Planet_2 but a higher mass star, would have a smaller a. So that's correct.

Now, the transit probability is R_star / a. Since both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R. So the probability for each is R / a.

So p1 = R / a1, p2 = R / a2.

What's the ratio p2/p1? That's (R/a2) / (R/a1) ) = a1/a2. Because R cancels out.

Earlier, a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So p2/p1 = a1/a2 ≈ 0.606. So p2 is about 0.606 times p1. Or p1 is about 1.65 times p2.

Wait, so p1 is higher than p2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher chance of transiting.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. The transit probability is higher when a is smaller because R is the same. So a smaller a leads to higher R/a, so higher probability. So if a1 < a2, then R/a1 > R/a2 → p1 > p2. So Planet_1 has higher probability. But the options say that. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D: ... 2.7 times.

Wait, but earlier I found that a1/a2 is (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606. So p1 = R/a1, p2 = R/a2. So p1/p2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1 = 1/(
