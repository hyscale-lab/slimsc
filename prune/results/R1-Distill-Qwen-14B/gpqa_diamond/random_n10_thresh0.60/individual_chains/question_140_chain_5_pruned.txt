Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, let's read the problem again and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 3 degrees Celsius. Hmm, maybe that's a hint about what B is.

Also, the product when a certain keto acid reacts with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So I'm thinking maybe X is something like a strong base or a halogen?

Let me think about each part.

First, gas W: same number of neutrons and protons. The molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So each atom in the molecule must have equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but the molecule could be something like H₂O. Let's see: H has 0 neutrons, O has 8. So each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So in H₂O, each molecule has (2 H atoms: 2*(1p,0n) and O: 8p,8n. So total protons per molecule: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. So not equal. Hmm. Maybe another gas.

Wait, maybe W is CO₂? No, that's a linear molecule. Or maybe it's something like O₂ or N₂? Let me see: O₂ has each O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope). So O has 8p and 8n. So for O₂, total protons: 16, total neutrons: 16. So that's equal. So W could be O₂. But wait, when you have O2 as a gas, yeah, it's possible. Alternatively, maybe it's another gas.

Wait, another possibility: NH3? No, because NH3 is a gas but when you have equal protons and neutrons. Let's check. N has 7p and 7n (assuming ^14N?), but H is 1p and 0n. Wait, but in a
