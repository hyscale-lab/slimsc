Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and I need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next lowest energy state.

Alright, let me start by recalling what the fundamental state means. In the context of quantum mechanics, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the first energy level (n=0 for vibration and the lowest rotational state, maybe J=0 or J=1? Wait, I'm a bit confused about the rotational states. Oh right, for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The lowest state is J=0, but that's just a point. The next would be J=1 for rotation.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state. So the vibrational quantum number is n=0. But when the photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I'm guessing that this next state is the first excited state, which would involve either increasing the vibrational state or the rotational state.

Wait, but the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the molecule's energy is a combination of rotational and vibrational energy. Oh, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so perhaps it's more accurate for diatomic
