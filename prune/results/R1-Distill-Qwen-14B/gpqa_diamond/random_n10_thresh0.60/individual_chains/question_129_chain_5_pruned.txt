Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me see if I can work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are four steps: A to B, B to C, C to D, and D to E. Plus, there are some hints and an options list to help me figure it out.

First, let me look at the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four cyclic ketones. So, E is a ketone, probably. Let's break this down.

Starting with hint a: When A reacts with a phosphorus ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm. A phosphorus ylide usually is a reagent in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes. The ylide attacks the carbonyl group of a ketone or aldehyde, converting it into an alkene.

Wait, so if A reacts with a ylide to form that cyclopentane compound, which has an alkenyl group (propan-2-ylidene is like a substituted methylene group), I think that suggests that A has a carbonyl group. Because the Wittig reaction involves a carbonyl.

So A is likely a cyclic ketone. Because when it reacts with HCN in the first step, that's probably a nucleophilic addition. Let me think about what HCN does. HCN adds to carbonyl groups, forming cyanohydrins. So compound B would be a cyanohydrin.

Then, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's hydrogenation, right? So any triple bonds or double bonds would be reduced. Since B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol (-OH) and a nitrile (-CN) group adjacent. Wait, but when you hydrogenate a cyanohydrin, I'm not exactly sure. Let's think about the structure.

A cyanohydrin would have the structure O-C-OH and adjacent to a CN? No, wait, the cyanohydrin formation adds HCN to the carbonyl, making an alcohol and a nitrile on adjacent carbons. So for example, if A is cyclopentanone, B would be 1-cyanocyclopentanol or something similar.

Wait, but when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine (CH2NH2?), but wait, nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd typically become amines. Alternatively,
