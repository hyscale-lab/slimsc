Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what it's about. The question has two parts, each involving a different reaction, and I need to select the correct reagents from the given options.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, okay. Let me break it down. 

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And when it reacts with NaCN, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. In the presence of a suitable reagent, NaCN could act as a nucleophile. But wait, I think the conditions matter here. If it's a base, like maybe in an aqueous solution, the ketone would react with the cyanide ion. Wait, but in the product, we get a hydroxy group. So, maybe it's a hydrocyanation reaction.

Wait, but hydrocyanation usually involves adding HCN to a carbonyl, right? But NaCN is a source of CN-; perhaps in acidic conditions, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by CN, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction.

Wait, another thought: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN. Oh, wait, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion in a base or under certain conditions. So, the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent.

But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon. That fits the cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation typically involves the addition of HCN to the carbonyl, but perhaps in the presence of a base. So, in a reaction like that, you usually have a base that deprotonates the nitrile, but I'm a bit confused about the exact conditions.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. For
