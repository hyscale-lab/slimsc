Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question involves an NMR analysis and a series of reactions. I need to figure out the structure of the starting compound and then determine the product after the reactions.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: each degree of unsaturation is a ring or a double bond. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0. That gives (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 â†’ 10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be a benzene ring (which is 4, and a double bond or ring) plus another double bond or a ring. But since the NMR mentions aromatic protons, likely a benzene ring is present.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as singlets, but in some cases, coupling can cause splitting. Wait, but an aldehyde proton is usually deshielded and appears as a singlet unless coupled to something else. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde then. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, which could cause splitting. Or perhaps it's an enol tautomer?

Wait, another possibility: an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. Oh wait, maybe it's an aromatic proton that's deshielded. But looking at the other signals, 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H) could be two sets of doublets, like para-substituted aromatic rings. For a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually two doublets. So if the NMR shows 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d,2H), that suggests a para-substituted group on a benzene ring. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with a substit
