Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c in the same direction, the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a possible relative speed and total energy.

Hmm, right, so the first thing I remember is that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, especially when adding them or finding relative velocities, you can't just subtract them normally because of special relativity. Newtonian mechanics don't apply here; we need to use the velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says "relative speed" between them. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. Both in the same direction. So, from A's perspective, B is moving at 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? But that's in Newtonian terms, which would make sense for non-relativistic speeds. But since they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we can't just subtract them like that. Oh right, we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, relativistic velocity addition formula is for when you have two velocities in the same direction, right? So the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Here, u is the velocity of the object, and v is the velocity of the frame. Wait, so in this case, which frame are we considering? Let's think: if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and B at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B's velocity would be (0.5c - 0.6c) over 1 minus (0.5c * 0.6c)/c². Wait, but that would be negative, so the relative speed would be the absolute value.

Let me compute that. So u is B's velocity in the lab frame, which is 0.5c. The velocity of the frame (A's frame) is 0.6c.

So applying the formula: (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c *
