Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy. So it's a 2D spacetime maybe, but I'm not sure if it's Riemannian or Lorentzian. Let me check the coefficients. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which could be positive or negative depending on the values of x and y.

Wait, but in a metric, the coefficients should be non-zero and probably positive if it's a Riemannian metric. Or negative if it's Lorentzian. But in this case, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². So when is this positive? When x² + y² < 4. So that would be a region where the radius squared is less than 4, meaning within a circle of radius 2. So the domain of this metric is x² + y² <4.

But wait, this looks a bit like the metric for a sphere, but with some scaling. Oh, wait, I remember that the metric for a sphere in 2D can be written as ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²), but that's in polar coordinates. Alternatively, when using isothermal coordinates, the metric can be expressed as ds² = e^{2f(r)} (dx² + dy²). Yeah, so in this case, the metric is scaled by 32/(4 - r²), where r² is x² + y².

So the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²). Conformal factors relate to the curvature, right? Because the Gaussian curvature in 2D is related to the function in the conformal factor.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K in terms of the conformal factor is K = - (1/(2 e^{2f})) * Laplacian of f, where f is the function in the metric e^{2f}(dx² + dy²). Wait, no, let me get that right. The Gaussian curvature for a metric e^{2f}(dx² + dy²) is actually K = - e^{-2f} [ ( (e^{2f})'' + (e^{2f}/r) ' ) ]

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the Ricci scalar for a 2D manifold, which is the Gaussian curvature. So let's compute that.

The given metric is ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ², but wait, no, it's in Cartesian coordinates. Hmm, perhaps it's better to switch to polar coordinates. Let me try that.

Let me set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So now, g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²). The off-diagonal terms (g_{rθ}) are zero because the metric is diagonal.

The Gaussian curvature K for a metric in polar coordinates (dr² + r² dθ²) with diagonal components g_{rr} and g_{θθ} is given by:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ sqrt(g_{θθ}) ' ] / sqrt(g_{rr}).

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the Ricci scalar. The Ricci scalar R in 2D is equal to the Gaussian curvature. The formula for R in terms of the metric coefficients is:

R = [ (g^{rr} (g_{θθ,r} - g_{rθ,θ}) ) ) + ... ] Hmm, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a conformally flat metric.

Wait, another approach: For a metric ds² = A(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by K = - (1/(2 A²)) (A'' + A'/r). Let me check that. Because in this case, A(r)^2 is 32/(4 - r²), so A(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, no, the general formula is that for a metric ds² = e^{2f} (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature K is - e^{-2f} [ (e^{2f})'' + (e^{2f})' / r ].

Wait, let me recall. The Gaussian curvature K is given by K = - (1/(2 e^{2f})) [ ∂²(e^{2f})/∂r² + (1/r) ∂/∂r (e^{2f}) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the Ricci scalar using the standard formula.

The Ricci scalar R is given by:

R = (1/(2 sqrt(|g|))) [ ∂(g^{rr} sqrt(g) ∂g_{θθ}/∂r ) / ∂θ + ... ] Hmm, maybe I'm getting bogged down here. Let me try to calculate the Gaussian curvature another way.

Wait, in 2D, the Gaussian curvature can be calculated from the metric components.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (g_{θθ,r} - g_{rr,θ} ) / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) ] + ... Wait, no, that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the curvature in terms of the Christoffel symbols.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the Ricci scalar directly. The Ricci scalar R in 2D is given by:

R = (1/(g)) [ (g^{rr} (g_{θθ,r} - g_{rθ,θ}) ) + (g^{θθ} (g_{rr,θ} - g_{rθ,r}) ) ) ]

But in this case, the metric is diagonal, so g_{rθ} is zero, so R simplifies.

Wait, in 2D, the Ricci scalar can be computed as R = e^{2f} [ (f'' + (f')^2 ) ] where f is the function in the conformal factor. Wait, no, that's perhaps for a specific case. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E dr² + G dθ² (with E = g_{rr}, G = g_{θθ}), is given by:

K = [ ( (sqrt(G))' ) / (2 sqrt(E G)) ) ]'

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, the formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of E and G is:

K = (1/(2 sqrt(E G))) [ (sqrt(E G))' ]_r + [ (sqrt(E G))' ]_θ ) / r )

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe I can instead find the Ricci scalar using the formula for 2D:

R = (1/(sqrt(g))) [ ∂(g^{rr} sqrt(g) g_{θθ,r}) ) / ∂θ + ... ] Well, maybe it's easier to look for another approach.

Wait, the problem is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's a pseudosphere? I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like the tractricoid. But in this question, maybe it's a sphere in some space, but perhaps the question is more about the area of the space described by the given metric.

Wait, the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it refers to the area of the metric's space.

Wait, the metric is given, and perhaps the question is about finding the area of the surface described by this metric. Or maybe it's about the area of a sphere embedded in this space.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere here refers to the 2D surface with this metric, and the radius r=2 is a parameter. Hmm.

Wait, but first, perhaps I should compute the Gaussian curvature K of this metric and see if it's constant.

So, going back, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So in polar coordinates, the metric components are:

g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²),
g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²),
and g_{rθ} = 0.

The Gaussian curvature K in 2D is given by:

K = [ (g_{θθ,r} ) / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) ] + [ (g_{rr,θ} ) / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) ]

Since the metric is independent of θ, the partial derivatives with respect to θ of g_{rr} and g_{θθ} are zero. So the second term involving g_{rr,θ} is zero.

So K = (1/(2 g_{rr} g_{θθ})) ) * g_{θθ,r}.

Let me compute g_{θθ}:

g_{θθ} = (32 r²)/(4 - r²).

Compute g_{θθ,r}, the partial derivative with respect to r:

g_{θθ,r} = d/dr [32 r²/(4 - r²)] 
= [32*(2r)(4 - r²) + 32 r²*(2r) ]/(4 - r²)^2 
Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Let me write g_{θθ} as 32 r² (4 - r²)^{-1}.

So derivative using product rule:

d/dr [32 r² (4 - r²)^{-1} ] = 32 [ 2r (4 - r²)^{-1} + r² * (-1) (4 - r²)^{-2} (-2r) ) ]

Simplify:

= 32 [ 2r/(4 - r²) + r² * 2r/(4 - r²)^2 ]

= 32 [ 2r/(4 - r²) + 2 r^3/(4 - r²)^2 ]

Factor out 2r/(4 - r²)^2:

= 32 * 2r/(4 - r²)^2 [ (4 - r²) + r^2 ]

Because 2r/(4 - r²) is 2r (4 - r²)^{-1} = 2r (4 - r²)^{-1} * (4 - r²)^2 / (4 - r²)^2 ) = 2r (4 - r² + r² ) / (4 - r²)^2 )

Wait, I'm a bit confused, maybe I should compute separately.

Wait, let me compute each term inside the brackets:

Term1: 2r/(4 - r²)
Term2: r² * 2r/(4 - r²)^2 = 2r^3/(4 - r²)^2

So together:

2r/(4 - r²) + 2r^3/(4 - r²)^2.

Let me factor 2r/(4 -r²)^2 from both terms:

[2r/(4 - r²)^2) ] * [ (4 - r^2) + r^2 ]

Because:

(4 - r²) * [2r/(4 - r²)^2)] = 2r/(4 - r²)
And (r^2) * [2r/(4 - r²)^2)] = 2 r^3/(4 - r²)^2.

So the sum is [2r/(4 - r²)^2)] * (4 - r² + r²) = [2r/(4 - r²)^2)] *4.

So putting it all together:

g_{θθ,r} = 32 * [2r/(4 - r²)^2)] *4 ?

Wait, no, wait: I think I made a miscalculation.

Wait, the expression is 32 * [2r/(4 - r²)^2)] * (4 - r² + r²) ?

Wait, 4 - r² + r² is 4, so:

g_{θθ,r} = 32 * [2r/(4 - r²)^2)] *4.

So that's 32 * 8 r / (4 - r²)^2 → 256 r / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, 2r * 4 is 8r.

So g_{θθ,r} = 32 * [8r/(4 - r²)^2)] = 256 r / (4 - r²)^2.

Now, compute 1/(2 g_{rr} g_{θθ}).

g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²)
g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²)

So g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r²)] = (32 * 32 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) = 1024 r² / (4 - r²)^2.

So 1/(2 g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) = (4 - r²)^2/(2 * 1024 r² ) ) = (4 - r²)^2/(2048 r² )

So K is [g_{θθ,r} ] * [1/(2 g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) ]

Which is [256 r/(4 - r²)^2 ] * [ (4 -r²)^2/(2048 r²) ) ]

Simplify:

256 r * (4 - r²)^2 * 1/(4 - r²)^2) * 1/(2048 r² )

So the (4 - r²)^2 terms cancel. So we have 256 r / (2048 r² )

Simplify numerator and denominator: 256 / 2048 = 1/8.

So 1/(8 r) multiplied by r in the numerator:

(256 r) / (2048 r²) ) → (256)/(2048 r) ) → 1/(8 r)

Wait, 256 divided by 2048 is 1/8. So 1/(8 r) * r → 1/8.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it again.

256 r / (2048 r²) = (256 / 2048) * (r / r² ) )= (1/8) * (1/r) )= 1/(8 r) )

So K = 1/(8 r) ?

Wait, but that can't be right because Gaussian curvature should be a constant for a pseudosphere. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the derivative calculation. Let me double-check the g_{θθ,r} computation.

g_{θθ} = 32 r² / (4 - r²)

So derivative w.r. to r is:

d/dr [32 r² (4 - r^2)^{-1} ] = 32 [ 2r (4 - r^2)^{-1} + r² * ( (4 - r^2)^{-1} ) ' ]

The second term is r² * derivative of (4 - r²)^{-1} which is (-1) * (4 - r²)^{-2} (-2r) ) → r² * (2r) / (4 - r^2)^2.

So putting it together:

32 [ 2r/(4 - r²) + 2 r^3/(4 - r²)^2 ]

Factor out 2r/(4 - r²)^2:

32 * [ 2r/(4 - r²)^2 ) ( (4 - r^2) + r^2 ) ]

Because (4 - r^2) = (4 - r^2) * (4 - r^2)^2/(4 - r^2)^2 ) = (4 - r^2) * (same denominator). So,

=32 * [2r/(4 - r^2)^2 ) * (4) ]

= 32 * 8 r / (4 - r^2)^2 → 256 r / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, that's correct. So then:

g_{θθ,r} = 256 r / (4 - r^2)^2.

Then K is:

K = [g_{θθ,r} ] * [1/(2 g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) ]

So we have:

K = [256 r / (4 - r^2)^2 ] * [ (4 - r^2)^2 )/(2 * 32/(4 - r^2) * 32 r^2/(4 - r^2) ) ) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator correctly.

g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r^2)
g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²)
So g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = [32/(4 - r^2)] * [32 r²/(4 - r^2)] = (32 *32 r²) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) = 1024 r²/(4 - r^2)^2.

So 1/(2 g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) = (4 - r^2)^2/(2 *1024 r² )

So K is:

= [256 r/(4 - r^2)^2 ] * [ (4 - r^2)^2/(2048 r²) ) ]

Simplify:

= (256 r) / (2048 r² ) )

Because (4 -r^2)^2 cancels.

So 256 /2048 = 1/8.

So K = (1/8) * (1/r) )= 1/(8 r )

Wait, that can't be right because K is a function of r, but a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the curvature formula. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not in polar coordinates. Wait, wait, no, I converted to polar coordinates correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what type of metric this is. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y^2)] (dx² + dy²).

Wait, 4 - x² - y^2 is 4 - r², so when r^2 <4, the denominator is positive.

This looks similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space, which has constant negative curvature. The standard metric for hyperbolic space in 2D is often written in terms of Poincaré coordinates as ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² - a²)^2, but that's not quite the same as this.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Poincaré disk model is ds² = 4 (dx² + dy²)/(1 - x² - y^2)^2.

Hmm, that's for the hyperbolic plane with Gaussian curvature K = -1/(a^2), if a is the radius parameter. Wait, but in the Poincaré model, the curvature is negative, so our given metric might be similar.

Comparing to the Poincaré metric: their metric is ds² = 4 (dx² + dy²)/(1 - x² - y^2)^2.

In our case, the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y^2)] (dx² + dy²).

So that's 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²) in polar coordinates.

Wait, so the denominator is 4 - r², which can be written as 4(1 - (r²/4)).

So perhaps the metric is a scaled version of the Poincaré metric.

Let me think: The Poincaré metric is ds² = (4/(1 - r²/a²)^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ² ), where a is the radius. Wait, no, the standard form is ds² = (a²/(a² - r²)^2 )) (dr² + r² dθ² ).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me recall.

The Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space in 2D has the metric:

ds² = (4 a²)/( (a² - r²)^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ² )

Wait, no, let me double-check. The Poincaré disk model is usually given with a curvature K=-1/a^2.

Wait, another source says the metric is ds² = (4 a²)/( (a² - r²)^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ² ), so that the curvature is K = -1/a².

In our case, the metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² +r² dθ² ), which is the same as 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ² ).

So that's like (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ² ). Comparing to the Poincaré metric, which would be (4 a²)/(a² - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ² ), perhaps we can match the terms.

So let me set 4 a²/(a² - r²)^2 = 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, perhaps not the same. Let me see.

Wait, 4 a²/(a² - r²)^2 = 32/(4 - r²).

Assume that 4 a² =32 → a²=8 → a=2√2.

Then denominator is (a² - r²)^2 → (8 - r²)^2. But in our case, denominator is 4 - r². So perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different scaling. Maybe the given metric is that of a hyperbolic plane with a certain radius, but I'm not getting it.

But the key point is that if the Gaussian curvature is constant, then the area is 2π |K|^{-1} for a sphere, but wait, no. Wait, in hyperbolic space, the area of a sphere is 2π a^2 (1 - cos(r/a)) ), but perhaps I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, but let's step back. The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So if this metric represents a pseudosphere, then the Gaussian curvature is a negative constant.

But earlier, when I calculated K, I got K= 1/(8 r), which depends on r. Hmm, which suggests that the curvature isn't constant, which can't be right for a pseudosphere.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake in calculating the curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric doesn't have constant curvature, which would complicate things.

Wait, let me try another approach to compute the curvature. Maybe using the formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the metric components.

Another formula for K is:

K = [ (g_{rr,θ} - g_{θθ,r}) ] / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ} )

Wait, but since the metric is independent of θ, g_{rr,θ}=0 and g_{θθ,r} is as before.

Wait, so K = [0 - g_{θθ,r} ] / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ} )

So K = - g_{θθ,r} / (2 g_{rr} g_{θθ} )

Wait, earlier I thought K was positive, but perhaps I flipped a sign. Let me recalculate with this formula.

So K = - [256 r / (4 - r^2)^2 ] / [2 * (32/(4 - r^2)) * (32 r²/(4 - r^2)) ) ]

Compute denominator: 2 * (32 *32 r² )/(4 -r^2)^2 ) → 2 * 1024 r² / (4 -r^2)^2 → 2048 r² / (4 - r^2)^2.

So K = - [256 r / (4 - r^2)^2 ] / [2048 r²/(4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

The (4 - r^2)^2 terms cancel.

So K = - [256 r ] / [2048 r^2 ] = - 256 / (2048 r ) → - (256)/(2048 r ) → - 1/(8 r )

Hmm, so K= -1/(8 r )

Wait, that's still dependent on r, which is not constant. So this metric doesn't have constant curvature. Which would mean that it's not a pseudosphere, but perhaps a different kind of surface.

Wait, but the question says 'pseudosphere of radius r=2'. So maybe I'm getting confused between the radius of the pseudosphere and the coordinates in the metric.

Wait, perhaps the 'radius' here refers to the curvature radius of the pseudosphere. For a pseudosphere (tractricoid), the Gaussian curvature is constant and negative, K = -1/a², where a is the radius.

So if the pseudosphere has radius 2, then K = -1/(2)^2 = -1/4.

Wait, but our calculation gave K= -1/(8 r ). So if r=2 (the radius of the pseudosphere?), then K= -1/(8 * 2 ) = -1/16.

Hmm, that's not matching. So perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps the given metric represents a pseudosphere, and we're to find its area. So a pseudosphere has infinite area. Because in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (like the one in the Poincaré disk) grows exponentially with radius, so it's infinite.

Wait, the area of a sphere in a space with negative curvature is 2π a^2 (1 - cos(r/a)) ), which approaches 2π a r as r approaches infinity. So for a pseudosphere, the area would be finite only if it's a compact surface, but I think the usual pseudosphere is non-compact and has infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is a two-dimensional space with a certain curvature, and the question is about the area of the entire space, which might be infinite.

Wait, looking at the metric ds^2 = [32/(4 - r^2)] (dr² +r² dθ²). The domain is r from 0 to 2, since beyond r=2 the denominator becomes negative, which would make the metric have imaginary coefficients, which isn't physical.

So the space is a 2D disk of radius 2. So the area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π of the square root of the determinant of the metric.

Wait, the determinant g = g_{rr} g_{θθ} - (g_{rθ})^2 → since it's diagonal, g = g_{rr} g_{θθ}.

So g = [32/(4 - r^2)] * [32 r^2/(4 - r^2)] → (32 *32 r^2 ) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) → 1024 r^2 / (4 - r^2)^2.

So the area is ∫ (from 0 to 2) ∫ (0 to 2π) sqrt(g) dθ dr.

Wait, √g would be sqrt(1024 r^2/(4 - r^2)^2 ) → 32 r/(4 - r^2).

So area = ∫ (0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] * 2π dr.

Wait, let's compute this integral.

So area = 2π * 32 ∫ (0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Hmm, that integral. Let me compute it.

Let me make a substitution u =4 - r² → du= -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

∫ [r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to 2 → ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [1/u ] * (-1/2) du → (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to 4) (1/u) du.

Which is (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to 4. But wait, when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln u approaches -infty. So the integral becomes (1/2) (ln4 - ln0 ), but ln0 is negative infinity, so the integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the domain is r=0 to 2, and the substitution led to integrating from u=4 to u=0. So perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me recompute:

The substitution u =4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → (r dr) = - du/2.

So ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) ) = ∫ ( (-du/2) ) /u → (-1/2) ∫ (du/u ) → (-1/2) ln|u| ) + C.

So the definite integral from r=0 to 2 is:

At r=2: u=0 → ln(0) = -infty.

At r=0: u=4 → ln(4).

So the integral is [ (-1/2)( ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] → (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) → (1/2)(infty + ln4 ), which is positive infinity.

So the area is 2π *32 * [infinite ] → which implies the area is infinite.

Wait, so the area is infinite. So the correct answer would be option D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2D space. Converting to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), where \(x = r \cos\theta\) and \(y = r \sin\theta\), the metric becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

### Key Observations:
1. **Domain of the Metric**: The denominator \(4 - r^2\) ensures the metric is real and non-degenerate only for \(r^2 < 4\), i.e., \(r < 2\). Thus, the space is a disk of radius 2.

2. **Gaussian Curvature**: The Gaussian curvature \(K\) for a metric \(ds^2 = A(r)^2 (dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2)\) is given by:
   \[
   K = -\frac{1}{A(r)} \left(\frac{dA(r)}{dr}\right),
   \]
   where \(A(r) = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}\). Computing \(K\), it is found to depend on \(r\), implying the curvature is not constant. This suggests the space is not a pseudosphere (which requires constant negative curvature).

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the space is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric over the domain. The determinant of the metric is:
   \[
   g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
   \]
   The area is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \sqrt{g} \, dr \, d\theta = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), the integral diverges to infinity because the denominator approaches zero as \(r \to 2\). Thus, the area of the space is infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (0)**: Incorrect. The area is not zero; the space is a disk of radius 2.
- **Option B (\(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\))**: Incorrect. This expression is not dimensionally consistent with an area and does not represent the computed result.
- **Option C (\(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\))**: Incorrect. This is not a valid expression for the area of the space.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\))**: Correct. The area of the space is infinite due to the divergence of the integral over the domain \(r < 2\).

### Conclusion:
The area of the space described by the given metric is infinite.

**Answer: D**
