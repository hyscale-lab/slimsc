Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a Ca-EDTA complex is present. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't think I need to worry about other factors like hydrolysis or anything like that. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects this particular calculation.

Wait, okay, so the Ca-EDTA complex is formed through a reaction. I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ to form a complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−, right? And the equilibrium constant K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex itself. I need to find out [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think the key here is to use the formation constant (Kf) for the complex. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The formula I remember is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). But wait, in this case, the problem gives me the K for the Ca-EDTA complex, which I think is Kf.

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. Now, I need to find [Ca²+]. But wait, when the complex dissociates, it releases one Ca²+ ion and one EDTA^4- ion. So, for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- are produced.

But wait, in solution, the EDTA might not all be in the Y^4- form because of the pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal. Oh right, so I can assume that the
