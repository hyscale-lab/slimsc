Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it doesn't have any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when there are no spots versus when there are spots.

Hmm, okay, so I remember from my studies that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation relates the population of two energy levels to their respective energies and the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n is the number of atoms in each level,
- g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy) of each level,
- E is the energy of each level,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

The problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, wait. Wait, the ratio observed is the number in level 1 to level 2, so (n1)/(n2). So when spots are present, this ratio is lower. That means that (n1)/(n2) is smaller when T is lower. Wait, but how does temperature affect the ratio?

Wait, let's think again. Let's denote the ratio when there are no spots as R0 = (n1/n2) at T=6000 K. And when there are spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K, so R_spots = (n1/n2) at T=5500 K. 

The problem says R_spots is lower than R0. So, R0 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*Teff0) ), and R_spots = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*Teff_spots) ). 

Wait, wait, wait. Let me clarify: since the ratio is (n1/n2), that is (n1)/(n2). From Boltzmann, (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ).

So the ratio (n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the exponent becomes a smaller number, because (E2-E1)/(k T) gets smaller when T is smaller, assuming (E2-E1) is positive (since level 2 is higher in energy than level 1). So exp(small number) is smaller, meaning (n1/n2) would be smaller. So yes, when the star has lower Teff, the ratio R = (n1/n2) decreases. So the observed effect matches this.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is R0 / R_spots. Because R0 is when there are no spots (higher T), and R_spots is when there are spots (lower T). So we need to compute (R0) / (R_spots) = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T0) )] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) )] ) ] * (g1/g2) / (g1/g2) ) → the g terms cancel because they're the same in R0 and R_spots, so it's just exp[ (E2 - E1)/(k) (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) ) ].

Wait, let's calculate that exponent. Let me denote delta_E = E2 - E1. So the factor is exp( delta_E/(k) (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) ) )

But wait, we don't know delta_E, but we do know the wavelength corresponding to the transition. The transition is at ~1448 Angstroms. That's in the far-ultraviolet, I think. The energy difference between the levels can be found using the photon energy equation E = hc / lambda.

So, E = hc / lambda. So delta_E = hc / lambda.

H is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), lambda is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So let's compute delta_E:

delta_E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)
= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m)
= approximately 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So delta_E is 1.373e-18 J.

So delta_E /k = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ approximately 9.95e4 ≈ ~1e5 K.

Wait, that's a rough estimate. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38) * 10^5 ≈ 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99,500 K. So delta_E/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

So the exponent is (99500) * (1/T0 - 1/T_spots).

We have T0 = 6000 K, T_spots = 5500 K.

So 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182. The difference is 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515.

So delta = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500*6000) ) → 500 / 33,000,000 → 1/(66,000) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So the exponent is 99500 * (1.515e-5) ≈ 99500 * 0.00001515 ≈ let's compute that.

99500 * 0.00001515 = (approx 1e5) * 0.000015 = 1.5, but more accurately:

99500 = 9.95e4.

9.95e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.95 * 1.515) * 1e-1. 

9.95 * 1.515 ≈ let's compute that:

10 *1.515=15.15. Subtract 0.05*1.515=0.07575 → 15.15 - 0.07575≈15.074.

Multiply by 1e-1 → 1.5074.

So exponent is about 1.5074.

So the factor is exp(1.5074) ≈ e^1.5074. Let me compute that. e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5≈4.4817, e^1.6≈4.953, e^1.5074 is between 4.48 and 4.5.

Wait, wait. Let me get a more accurate value. Let me compute 1.5074.

We can use the Taylor expansion or a calculator approximation.

Alternatively, I know that ln(4.5)=approximately 1.504. Let me check:

ln(4.5) = ln(9/2) = ln(9) - ln(2) = 2.1972 - 0.6931 ≈ 1.5041.

So 1.504 is ln(4.5). So 1.5074 is slightly higher than that. So e^1.5074 ≈ 4.5 * e^(0.0033) ≈ 4.5 * (1 + 0.0033 + ...) ≈ ~4.5 * 1.0033 ≈ 4.515.

So the factor would be approximately 4.5.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation steps.

Another approach: let me compute (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) )= (-500)/(33,000,000) )= - 1/(66,000). So 1/5500 is higher than 1/6000, so (1/5500 - 1/6000) is positive.

Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, no: 1/5500 is around 0.0001818, 1/6000 is about 0.00016667, so 1/5500 is larger than 1/6000. So (1/5500 - 1/6000) = positive 0.00001515.

So the exponent is (delta_E/k) * (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think: the exponent in the ratio R is:

R0 / R_spots = exp[ (delta_E/k) (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) ]

Wait no, from earlier, R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( delta_E/(k T) )

So when T is higher (no spots), the exponent is larger.

So when R0 is at T0=6000, and R_spots is at T=5500, then R0 / R_spots = exp( (delta_E/k) (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) ) )

Which is (delta_E/k) multiplied by (1/6000 - 1/5500) ?

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, no, R0 = exp(delta_E/(k T0)), R_spots = exp(delta_E/(k T_spots)).

So R0/R_spots = exp( [delta_E/(k T0) - delta_E/(k T_spots)] )

= exp( delta_E/(k) [1/(T0) - 1/(T_spots)] )

Ah, yes. So that's correct. So 1/T0 is smaller than 1/T_spots, so their difference is negative. Wait, no: 1/6000 is about 0.00016667, 1/5500 is about 0.0001818. So 1/T0 is smaller than 1/T_spots. So 1/T0 - 1/T_spots is negative.

Wait, so delta_E/(k) is positive (because delta_E=E2-E1>0), so [delta_E/(k)] * (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) is positive times a negative number. So the exponent is negative. So R0/R_spots is exp(negative number), which is less than 1.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when there are spots. So R_spots < R0 → R0/R_spots > 1. But according to the calculation, if the exponent is negative, R0/R_spots is less than 1, which would imply R_spots is higher than R0, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I got the ratio backwards.

Wait, let me clarify. R is (n1/n2). The problem says when the star has spots, this ratio decreases.

So R_spots < R0 → R0/R_spots >1.

Hmm, but according to the Boltzmann equation, R = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) * (g1/g2). So higher T makes the exponent bigger, so higher R, assuming E2>E1.

So when T is higher (no spots), R is higher. So R0 is higher than R_spots, which matches the problem's observation.

So R0/R_spots = exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) ) ].

Wait, but wait: 1/T0 is less than 1/T_spots. Because T0=6000, T_spots=5500. So 1/6000 < 1/5500.

So (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) is negative. So the exponent is (delta_E/k) * negative number. Which makes the exponent negative. So exp(negative) is less than 1. That would imply R0/R_spots <1, which suggests R0 < R_spots, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, when the star has spots, R decreases, so R_spots < R0 → R0/R_spots >1. So according to our calculation, it's less than 1. That's a problem. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs in the exponent. Let me re-derive the ratio.

Wait, from the Boltzmann equation:

(n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent increases, making (n1/n2) larger, which means more atoms in level 1 than level 2. So higher T → higher (n1/n2).

So when the star has spots, T drops → (n1/n2) ratio drops. So R0 (at 6000K) is higher than R_spots (5500 K). So R0 / R_spots should be greater than 1.

So the factor is R0 / R_spots = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T0) )] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) )] = exp( (E2-E1)/k (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) )

Wait, wait, no: exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k T0) ) ] ) is R0 / (g1/g2) → Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Let me compute the exponent without the (g1/g2) factor, since they cancel out.

So, R0/R_spots = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T0) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ]

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/(T0) - 1/(T_spots) ] )

Wait, no, more accurately, it's [ (E2-E1)/(k T0) ) ] - [ (E2-E1)/(k T_spots) ) ] = (E2-E1)/(k) [ 1/T0 - 1/T_spots ]

Which is the same as (E2-E1)/(k) * ( (T_spots - T0) ) / (T0 T_spots) )

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let me compute the exponent delta = (E2 - E1)/(k) * (1/T0 - 1/T_spots)

We already found that (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 99,500 K.

Now, 1/T0 is 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667 K^-1, 1/T_spots is 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182 K^-1.

So 1/T0 - 1/T_spots = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -1/(66,000) ≈ -0.00001515 K^-1.

So delta = 99500 K * (-0.00001515 K^-1) ≈ -1.507 K.

So exponent is -1.507.

So R0/R_spots = exp( -1.507 ) ≈ e^(-1.507) ≈ 0.220.

But wait, the problem states that R decreases when there are spots, so R0/R_spots should be >1, but 0.22 is less than 1. That's a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the levels. Which level is higher in energy? Because if I mixed them up, the sign would change.

Wait, in the Boltzmann equation, when E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So if level 2 is higher, then higher T would make n2 larger than n1, so (n1/n2) would be smaller.

But according to the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, and (n1/n2) decreases. So R0 is higher than R_spots, which is correct. So R0/R_spots is greater than 1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent. Let me recalculate the exponent.

Wait, delta_E = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 Angstrom = 1448e-10 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

1.9878e-25 / (1448e-10) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

So delta_E = 1.373e-18 J.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So delta_E /k = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 9.95e4 ≈ 99500 K.

Now, 1/T0 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667.

1/T_spots = 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182.

So 1/T0 - 1/T_spots = (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) ≈ -0.00001515.

So delta = (99500 K) * (-0.00001515) ≈ -1.507.

So the exponent is -1.507.

Thus, R0/R_spots = e^(-1.507) ≈ 0.220.

But that would imply R0 is about 0.22 times R_spots, which is the opposite of what the problem says. Because the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. So R0 > R_spots → R0/R_spots >1. But according to this, it's 0.22, which is less than 1. So this suggests that the ratio R decreases when T increases, which contradicts our earlier analysis.

This can't be right. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I have the wrong sign in the exponent. Let me re-examine the Boltzmann equation.

Boltzmann equation: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, but wait, no: (E2-E1) is positive, so (E2-E1)/(k T) → as T increases, this term decreases. So exp(small number) is smaller, so (n1/n2) = exp(small number) → so (n1/n2) is smaller when T is higher.

Wait, that's not what I thought before. Let me clarify.

Wait, suppose E2 > E1. Then (E2-E1)/(k T) is positive. So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) becomes smaller, which means (n1/n2) becomes smaller. So when T increases, (n1/n2) decreases.

But according to the problem, when spots are present, T decreases. So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases. So exp(...) increases, so (n1/n2) increases. Which would mean that R_spots is higher than R0, which contradicts the problem statement.

But the problem says that when there are spots, R decreases. So my analysis must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me define R as (n2)/(n1). Then, according to the problem, when T decreases, R would decrease. Because, from the Boltzmann equation, (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent increases (since E2-E1 is positive, and T is in denominator), so exp(...) increases, so (n2/n1) increases. So R would increase when T decreases.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Which is equivalent to (n2/n1) increases. So if R = (n2/n1), then R increases when T decreases.

But the problem says that R (n1/n2) decreases when T decreases. So perhaps I'm still getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the same level configuration.

Wait, perhaps I have the levels mixed up. Let me think again. Suppose E1 is the lower energy level and E2 is higher. So (E2-E1) is positive.

When T increases, the population tends to distribute more into higher energy states. So n2 increases, n1 decreases → (n1/n2) decreases.

So when T is higher (no spots), (n1/n2) is lower than when T is lower (spots). So R0 is lower than R_spots?

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think clearly. Let me take two scenarios.

Case 1: No spots, T=6000 K.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) )

Case 2: Spots, T=5500 K.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*5500) )

Which one is larger?

Since 5500 < 6000, the exponent in case 2 is larger (because (E2-E1)/(k*5500) > (E2-E1)/(k*6000)), so exp(-x) is smaller when x is larger. So exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) < exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) )

So n2/n1 in case 2 is smaller than in case 1. So (n2/n1) is higher in case 1 (no spots) than in case 2 (spots). So R = (n1/n2) would be lower in case 1 and higher in case 2. Wait, no: (n1/n2) is inverse of (n2/n1). So if (n2/n1) is higher in case 1, then (n1/n2) is lower in case 1.

So when the star has spots (case 2), (n1/n2) is higher than when there are no spots (case 1).

But the problem says that when the star has spots, (n1/n2) decreases. So this contradicts, which suggests that there's a mistake in the setup.

Wait, that's a problem. So according to the Boltzmann equation, when the effective temperature decreases (spots present), (n1/n2) increases. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Which would suggest that our assumption about the energy levels might be wrong. Perhaps E2 is lower than E1? But that doesn't make sense because transitions are from lower to higher energy levels when they emit photons.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed line is an absorption line, and the excitation is such that the level structure is different. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let's think differently.

The problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. So the star is cooler overall. Now, the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots.

Wait, so when the star is cooler, (n1/n2) is smaller. So according to the equation, that would mean that higher T leads to lower (n1/n2). Which would imply that when T is higher, n2 is more populated than n1.

Wait, but that's what the Boltzmann equation says. So in our earlier calculation, when T is higher, (n1/n2) is lower. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so (n1/n2) is higher. But the problem says that when there are spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the sign of the exponent.

Wait, the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so the exponent decreases. So exp(small) is smaller. So (n1/n2) decreases when T increases.

So when the star has no spots (higher T), (n1/n2) is lower. So R0 is lower than R_spots. So R0/R_spots is less than 1.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Which would imply R_spots < R0 → R0/R_spots >1. So that's a contradiction.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent. Let me re-express the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should have (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, no, that's the same as before because E2-E1 is positive, so -(E1-E2) is same as (E2-E1).

Wait, perhaps I should switch the levels. Suppose E1 is higher than E2. Then (E2-E1) would be negative. So the exponent would be negative. Let me try that.

Assume E1 > E2. So (E2-E1) is negative. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) = exp( negative ), which is less than 1.

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp(...) becomes smaller, so (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) → smaller. So when T increases, (n1/n2) decreases.

When the star has spots, T decreases → (E2-E1)/(k T) is less negative (i.e., closer to zero), so exp(...) increases. So (n1/n2) increases. So if the star is cooler, (n1/n2) increases. So when the star has spots, (n1/n2) is higher than when it doesn't. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this still doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try to think of a different approach. Let me calculate the factor numerically.

We have the ratio R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

We can compute the ratio when T is 6000 K and when T is 5500 K.

R0 = (g1/g2) exp( delta_E/(k *6000) )

R_spots = (g1/g2) exp( delta_E/(k *5500) )

The factor is R0/R_spots = exp( delta_E/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, but delta_E/(k) = 99500 K.

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -1/(66000) ≈ -0.00001515.

So delta_E/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )= 99500 * (-0.00001515) ≈ -1.507.

So R0/R_spots = exp( -1.507 ) ≈ 0.220.

But this would imply that R0 is 0.22 times R_spots. So R0 < R_spots → when the star has spots, R is higher, which contradicts the problem statement.

Hmm. So either I'm making a mistake in the calculation, or the problem has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from a higher energy level to a lower one, so that E2 is lower than E1. Let me try that.

If E2 is lower than E1, then (E2-E1) is negative. So delta_E = (E2-E1) = negative.

So delta_E/(k) = -99500 K.

So the exponent becomes:

delta_E/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (-99500) * ( -0.00001515 ) ≈ 99500 * 0.00001515 ≈ 1.507.

So R0/R_spots = exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507 ≈ 4.5.

So that's option C: ~4.5.

But wait, why would E2 be lower than E1? The transition is from E1 to E2, which would imply that E2 is higher. But perhaps the transition is actually from E2 to E1, which would mean that E1 is higher than E2. So perhaps the way I'm considering the energy levels is reversed.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is E1 - E2, not E2 - E1.

Wait, the problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Angstroms. So the energy difference is E2 - E1 = hc/lambda, with lambda being the photon emitted when an electron transitions from E2 to E1. Wait, no: when an electron transitions from a higher energy level (E2) to a lower (E1), it emits a photon of energy E2-E1 = hc/lambda.

So in that case, E2 > E1, so (E2-E1) is positive. So why are we getting a contradiction? Because according to the problem, when the star has spots, (n1/n2) decreases.

But according to our calculations, when T decreases, (n1/n2) increases. So if the problem says that (n1/n2) decreases, that's only possible if the ratio is (n2/n1), not (n1/n2).

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to (n2/n1) when it says the ratio decreases. Let me read the problem again.

The question states: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So the ratio is (n1/n2). So when T decreases, (n1/n2) increases. But the problem says it decreases. So I'm getting a conflicting result.

This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is in the opposite direction. Let's say that the observed line is due to a transition from E1 to E2, which would require E2 > E1. So when the star is cooler, the excitation is less, so fewer atoms in E2. So (n1/n2) increases when T decreases, which contradicts the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the ionization state. Wait, no, the question says neutral atoms.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio (n2/n1), which would be (n2)/(n1). If that ratio decreases when T decreases, that would fit with the calculation.

Because, with E2>E1:

(n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

When T decreases, the exponent increases (since denominator is smaller), so exp( -x ) decreases. So (n2)/(n1) decreases when T decreases.

So if the observed ratio is (n2/n1), then it would decrease when T decreases, which matches the problem statement.

But the problem says the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, which would not fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mistakenly referring to (n2/n1) as the ratio. Because our calculation shows that (n2/n1) decreases when T decreases.

So, perhaps the factor we're looking for is (n2/n1)_0 / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which would be exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T0 - 1/T_spots) )

Which is exp( 99500 K * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, 1/6000 is 0.00016667, 1/5500 is 0.00018182. So 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative, as before.

So the exponent is 99500 * (-0.00001515) ≈ -1.507.

So (n2/n1)_0 / (n2/n1)_spots = exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.22 → which is less than 1. So (n2/n1) decreases when T decreases, which matches the problem statement.

But then, the ratio (n1/n2) would be 1/(n2/n1), so it would increase when T decreases.

But the problem says (n1/n2) decreases, which is the opposite.

So I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should just proceed with the calculation as per the given data, regardless of the confusion.

So the factor is exp(1.507) ≈ 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, \( R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \), changes when a star transitions from having no dark spots (effective temperature \( T_0 = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (effective temperature \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio decreases when the star has spots, and the transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). The photosphere is assumed to be in LTE, so the Boltzmann equation governs the population distribution between the energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( E_2 > E_1 \) (since the transition is from a higher to a lower energy level), \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Difference**: The energy difference between the levels is calculated using the photon energy equation:
   \[
   \Delta_E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
   \]
   where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values gives:
   \[
   \Delta_E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Ratio**: The ratio of the energy difference to Boltzmann's constant is:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta_E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K}.
   \]

3. **Exponent Calculation**: The factor by which the ratio changes is determined by the difference in the Boltzmann exponents at \( T_0 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \):
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta_E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_0} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_0} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00016667, \quad \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.00018182,
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_0} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} = 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = 99,500 \times (-0.00001515) \approx -1.507.
   \]

4. **Final Factor**: The factor is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(-1.507) \approx 0.220.
   \]
   However, this result contradicts the problem's statement that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. To resolve this, the problem likely refers to the inverse ratio \( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \), which decreases when \( T \) decreases. Recalculating for \( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \), the factor becomes:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.507) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately **4.5**, corresponding to option C.
