Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm. Let me read it again.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So Ca-EDTA would be a complex ion. Since the solution contains the complex, I think I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

The complex is stoichiometric, which I think means it's in a 1:1 ratio. So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA^4- ion. So the formula would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA.

The formation constant, K, for the complex is given as 5x10^10. I think the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction should be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the Kf equation would be K = [CaEDTA²−] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in solution, the concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. Let me denote it as [C] = 0.02 M.

I think the total EDTA in solution comes from both the free EDTA and the complex. But since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio, the total EDTA (T_EDTA) would be [EDTA_free] + [C] = [EDTA_total]. Hmm, but wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, but in this case, it's already complexed as a 1:1 with Ca²+.

So, the idea is that when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The formation constant is very large, which means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA would be very low.

Let me set up the variables. Let [Ca²+] = x. Then, because the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4−, the concentration of free EDTA would also be x, assuming that all the Ca²+ comes from the dissociation. Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial EDTA comes from two sources: the complex and any free EDTA. But wait, the complex is the only source because the solution is only 0.02 M of the complex. So when it dissociates, each mole of complex releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So if the complex dissociates a little, the free [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] would both be approximately x.

So, Kf = [C] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] ) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

So, 0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) → which is approximately 1.414e-6.5?

Wait, let me calculate that. 2e-13 is 2 x 10^-13. The square root of 2 is about 1.414, and sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 1.414 * 3.16e-7 is around 4.47e-7. Wait, wait that can't be right because 1e-13 square root is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So sqrt(2e-13) is sqrt(2) * 1e-6.5, which is approximately 1.414 * 3.16e-7 = about 4.47e-7 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M, which is a little higher than that. Hmm. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, maybe I missed a factor. Let me recheck the math.

Wait, Kf is given as 5e10. So 0.02 / x² =5e10 → x²=0.02/(5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Hmm, x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → which is 2 * 3.16e-7 → approx 6.32e-7. Oh, that makes sense! So x is about 6.3e-7 M. Which matches option C.

Wait, so why did I get 4e-13 earlier? Because 0.02 is 2e-2, and 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12, which is 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. Oh yeah, that's correct. So x² is 4e-13, so x is 2e-6.5, which is 6.3e-7.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M and assuming that the dissociation of the complex releases equal amounts of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), let the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) be \(x\). Then, the concentration of free \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) is also \(x\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
