Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos and the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos through various nuclear reactions in its core. The main one is the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping. Wait, what's the pp-III branch again?

I think the proton-proton chain is the primary way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. The pp-I branch is the initial step where two protons fuse into deuterium. Then, there are two other branches, pp-II and pp-III, which involve different reactions but eventually lead to the same end products. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves a higher-energy process, maybe involving a carbon nucleus or something like that. 

So the question says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So the Sun's core is where these reactions happen, and if something stops there, the effects would take some time to reach us. But neutrinos, being nearly massless and moving at speeds close to light, escape the Sun quickly. So if the pp-III branch stops now, the neutrinos from that reaction would have already left the Sun before the change, right? Or would the change affect the production of neutrinos that are being emitted now?

Wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos reaching Earth. If the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop. But the other reactions continue. So we need to find the ratio of the fluxes in two energy bands after this change.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the details of the neutrino production from each branch. From what I remember, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos from the pp chain. Each branch produces different energy distributions.

The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-II and pp-III produce higher. But wait, I'm mixing up something. No, wait: the pp-I is the initial step, and it's the dominant one, producing neutrinos with a certain spectrum. The other branches, II and III, are minor but contribute to higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, another thought: the neutrino emission in the Sun is mainly via the pp-I branch. The pp-II and
