Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't ignore special relativity effects here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass, v_max. The options are all different expressions, so I need to figure out the correct formula.

I know that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, for a spring, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic case, so option C might not be correct.

In relativity, energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy includes gamma times mc². So the energy in the system must account for that.

The oscillator's total energy comes from the spring's potential energy, which in the relativistic case might be different. Wait, but the force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx, which is non-relativistic. Does that mean we're treating the potential energy classically but using relativistic energy for the mass? Or is the potential energy also treated relativistically?

Hmm. Wait, I think the potential energy U is given by the integral of F dx, which would be (1/2)kx², assuming F is -kx. So the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA².

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy E of the mass when it's at maximum displacement (so velocity zero) would be the sum of its rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So when the mass is at the equilibrium position, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which would be (gamma - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait no, wait. When the mass is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. Then, when it's at equilibrium (x=0), all
