Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance formula is something like d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + something with the angles). Wait, no, rhombohedral is a special case, right?

Oh right, for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. So I think the formula is different. Let me think. Oh yeah, for a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)cosθ ), where θ is the angle between the axes.

Wait wait, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should double-check the formula. Another approach: for a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance between planes (hkl) can be calculated using the formula involving the lattice parameter a and the angles. Since all angles are equal (α = β = γ = 30 degrees), perhaps there's a simplified formula.

Alternatively, another formula I've heard of is d = a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) ) / (something with cos(alpha/2)). Wait, no, maybe that's for something else. I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, maybe I should use the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal lattice. The formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a
