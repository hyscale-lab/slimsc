Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Let's see.

The problem states that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, putting that together, S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And Ay is c times S. So let me calculate Ay first. Substituting c = h/(4π):

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S
= (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],
              [i, 0]]

So, the matrix for Ay is:
[[0, -i h/(4π)],
 [i h/(4π), 0]]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. Eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation: det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let's write (Ay - aI):

Ay - aI = [[ -a, (-i h/(4π)) ],
          [ (i h/(4π)), -a ]]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating each part:

First part is a². The second term is [ (-i)(i) ] * (h²)/(16π²). Let's compute (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So that term becomes [1]*(h²)/(16π²) = (h²)/(16π²).

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²)/(16π²) = 0.

Which simplifies to a² = (h²)/(16 π²)
So taking square roots, a = ± (h)/(4 π)

Wait, because h is Planck's constant. Hmm, but wait a second. Another approach, since S is related to the Pauli matrices, perhaps. Oh wait, S is proportional to the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli Y matrix is:

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

Which is exactly what S is. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. Oh, but in this case, Ay = c * S, so the eigenvalues would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

So S has eigenvalues ±1. Multiply by c, so Ay has eigenvalues ±c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply a matrix by a scalar, the eigenvalues are also multiplied by that scalar. So yes, eigenvalues would be ±c.

So each eigenvalue a is ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right? Because the Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues, and multiplying by a scalar doesn't change that. So the eigenvalues of Ay are real.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let's check.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be, because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. Not sure about this yet.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Because I thought the eigenvalues were real, but the options don't have that.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I miscalculated. The matrix Ay is:

[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

Wait, when I compute the determinant, it's [(-a)(-a)] - [( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]

Which is a² minus [ (-i * i) *
