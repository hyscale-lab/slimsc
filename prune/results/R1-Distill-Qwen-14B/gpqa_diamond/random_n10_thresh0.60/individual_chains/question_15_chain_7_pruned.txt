Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm. I remember that the transit method depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on relative to us. 

Wait, but what determines the probability of a transit? Oh right, it's related to the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I think is something like (R_planet + R_star) divided by the orbital distance, but I'm not exactly sure. No wait, maybe the probability is more about the planet's orbital inclination and the star's size. 

I remember that the probability P is roughly (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Oh right, the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a). So P â‰ˆ (R*/a) * (some function of the orbital plane alignment).

Wait, but how does the RV method play into this? Well, the RV method gives the minimum mass of the planet, but since both have the same mass, that's not a factor here. The other factors are their orbital periods, the size of their stars, and their semi-major axes. 

Given that both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period (three times shorter than Planet_2). Since orbital period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law, right? So for the same star, a shorter period means a smaller a. But in this case, the stars
