Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says the crystal is rhombohedral, which I remember is a type of crystal system where all the edges are equal, and all the angles are the same. Oh right, so for a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, and the angles α, β, γ are all equal too. In this case, the angles are 30 degrees each, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember the formula for interplanar distance d is given by the Bragg's law equation, which involves the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the formula for d is 1/d = sqrt( (h²/l²) + (k²/m²) + (k²/n²) ) multiplied by some factor depending on the crystal system. Oh wait, no, wait. The general formula is 1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) divided by some volume factor involving the angles, right? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with the structure factor.

Oh, wait, for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is given by d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But this is a rhombohedral system, which is not cubic. So the formula must be a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (1/3) ) ) / (sqrt(3))? Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the unit cell vectors.

No, wait, maybe I should recall the formula for a rhombohedral crystal. The interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral systems is given by:

d_{hkl}^2 = (a² (h² + k² + l²) - a² (hk + hl + kl) cos α ) / ( (h + k + l)^2 (1 - cos α) ) )

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right
