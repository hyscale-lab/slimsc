Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I need to normalize this state first, right? Because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, and the state should be a unit vector.

Wait, I remember that to normalize a vector, you compute the inner product of the state with itself and then divide each component by the square root of that. So, the normalization factor would be 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each coefficient.

Let me calculate the coefficients. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The absolute squares are |1+i|² and |2-i|². 

|1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
|2 -i|² is (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.
So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) times (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is already proportional. So the actual state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). Got it.

Now, the next part: the operator whose matrix elements Aij are hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j go from 1 to 2. So when i≠j, Aij = hbar/2. So the matrix looks like this:

Row 1: A11=0, A12=hbar/2
Row 2: A21=hbar/2, A22=0

So the matrix A is:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Wait, but that doesn't look like a standard operator. Oh, wait. Oh, wait, perhaps it's another way. Alternatively, maybe it's a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So yeah, that's correct.

Hmm, I'm trying to remember what kind of operator this is. Hmm. If we think about Pauli matrices, perhaps. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But this matrix A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X has 1s in the off-diagonal. So if I multiply Pauli X by hbar/2, I get exactly the matrix A.

Wait, let me check: Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so (hbar/2) * X would be [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], which matches our A. So operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. So in other words, A = (hbar/2) σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, corresponding to eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), respectively. Wait, no, wait. Wait, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A would have eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1 = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)*(-1) = -hbar/2. Right.

But wait, the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So, the operator A's eigenstates are |
