Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup: There's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity isn't at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R, so the conductor is bigger. 

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that when a charge is inside the cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, initially, the conductor is uncharged. So when we add a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens? Since the conductor was neutral before, the charges inside the conductor will redistribute.

I think that in a conductor, the charges move to the surface. But if the conductor is neutral, then the induced charges would be negative and positive? No, wait, when you have a charge inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's interior (the cavity) will have induced charges.

Wait, more accurately, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the enclosed charge. So if +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the total charge of the conductor is zero, inner surface is -q, so outer surface is +q.

But wait, wait. The conductor is initially uncharged. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. Since the conductor's total charge was zero, the outer surface must have +q, because the outer charge is the sum of the inner induced charge and the original conductor's charge.

So the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. 

Now, the electric field outside the conductor at point P. Since point P is outside the conductor (L > R), the electric field should be the same as if all the charge of the conductor were concentrated at the center. Because of the shell theorem, right? The outer surface's charge behaves as if it's a point charge located at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has +q. So the electric field outside the conductor due to the conductor's charge is E = (1/(4πε0)) * (q_enclosed) / (L^2), where q_enclosed is the charge outside which we are considering. Here, since the conductor's outer surface has +q, the electric field outside would be (1/(4πε0)) * (q) / (L^2). But wait, that would be option B.

But wait, wait a second. The charge +q isn't just distributed on the outer surface. Let's think again. The charge inside the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. So the total charge outside the conductor is +q.

But when considering the electric field at a point outside the conductor, all the charge outside contributes, and the charges inside the conductor (the inner surface) don't contribute because they are enclosed. So, outside, the conductor behaves as if all its charge is at the center.

So the electric field E at point P would be due to the +q on the outer surface. So E = (1/(4πε0)) * q / L². That would make option B correct.

Wait, but what about the position of the charge inside the cavity? How does that affect the field outside? Because the point P is outside the conductor, the field should not depend on where the charge is inside the cavity. It's as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor. Because the induced charges on the inner surface of the conductor cancel the field inside the conductor, except for the region inside the cavity.

Wait, no, that's only for the region inside the conductor. The field inside the conductor is zero. The field in the cavity is due to the charge +q and the induced charges. Wait, but the field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface has +q, so the field outside is as if that charge is at the center.

So regardless of where +q is placed inside the cavity (as long as it's inside, which it is), the conductor's outer surface will have +q, and the field outside is as if a point charge +q is at the center.

So point P is outside the conductor, so E is k q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4 π ε0)) * q / L², which matches.

Wait, but why are the other options considering l and theta? Because the point P is at some position relative to the cavity's center. But since we're outside the conductor, the position relative to the cavity shouldn't matter. It's all about the net charge on the conductor's outer surface and the distance from the center.

So the correct answer must be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ (where $r < R$). The center of the cavity is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor induces a charge of $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor. Since the conductor is initially neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the total charge. The electric field outside the conductor at point $P$ depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is $+q$, and not on the position of the charge inside the cavity.

By the shell theorem, the electric field outside a spherical conductor is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because they introduce unnecessary dependencies on $l$, $s$, $\theta$, or $l^2$, which are irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.

Answer: B
