Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully and break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. They release a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Then there's a part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce something with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. Finally, I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by identifying what each part might be.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reactions often involve strong acids or bases. Y is a liquid, so maybe something like concentrated sulfuric acid, but I'm not sure. Wait, Y could be something else. Alternatively, maybe Y is water? No, because water is a liquid, but when it reacts violently, maybe it's something like a metal reacting with acid.

Wait, when a metal reacts with an acid, it typically produces hydrogen gas. So gas W might be hydrogen. Let's check what the problem says about W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hydrogen has only one proton and no neutrons (if it's H-1), but wait, deuterium would have one proton and one neutron. But the molecule—if W is H2, each H atom would have 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Hmm, that's a problem because the molecule as a whole can't have the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, maybe each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So if W is, say, something like CO2, but that's not a gas produced in such reactions. Alternatively, maybe W is NH3? No, that's a gas but not produced here.

Wait, another approach. The problem says gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. So what molecules have equal number of protons and neutrons? Let me think. For example, H2O: each molecule has 8 protons (since O has 8, each H has 1) and 8+10=18? No, wait. Wait, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming H1). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since O is usually ^16O, which is 8p,8n). So H2O: each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. So total protons: 2*1 + 8 =10. Total neutrons: 2*0 +8=8. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons—doesn't match.

Another possibility: maybe W is CH4. Each CH4 has 6 protons (C has 6) plus 4 H's (each 1): 6+4=10 protons. Each C has 6 neutrons (since ^12C has 6n), each H has 0. So total neutrons: 6 + 4*0=6. So protons:10, neutrons:6. Not equal.

Wait, maybe W is something like CO? No, because CO is a gas, but let's see. C has 6p, O has 8p. So each molecule has 14p. C has 6n (if ^12C), O has 8n. So total n=14. So 14p and 14n. That would work. So W is CO. But what reaction produces CO? Or maybe H2O is involved, but no. Alternatively, maybe it's something like NO, which has 14p and 14n (each molecule would have 14p: 7 from each N and O. Wait, NO has each molecule: 14p (7 from N, 7 from O), and 14n (since N has 7n, O has 8n? Wait, no.

Wait, another approach. If W is H2, each molecule has 2 atoms. Each H has 1p and 0n. So total 2p, 0n. Not equal. If the gas is O2, each molecule has 16p (8 per O atom) and 16n (since O is ^16O, 8n each). So each molecule has 16p and 16n. So that's equal. So W could be O2.

Wait, but O2 is produced when? Like in some decomposition reactions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction produces O2 as a gas. But then, what reaction between X and Y would produce O2? Hmm, maybe X is a peroxide, but that might not fit the other parts.

Alternatively, another possibility: W is NH3. Each molecule has 14p (N=7, H3=3 → 10? Wait, no. Let me think again. Each NH3 molecule has 7p (N) + 3*(1p) = 10p. Neutrons: N has 7n, each H has 0. So total neutrons:7. So 10p and 7n. Not equal.

Wait, perhaps W is CH4 as I thought earlier. Each molecule has 6 (C) +4=10 p. Neutrons: 6 (from C) +0=6. Not equal.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. Maybe it's a double displacement reaction, producing a precipitate and gas. For example, if X is a metal and Y is an acid, then G would be a metal sulfate or something, and W would be H2.

Wait, but if W is H2, then each H2 molecule has 2p and 0n. So that doesn't match. So this approach may not be correct.

Wait, another angle. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substance has a melting point around there? Maybe ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Wait, another thought: water freezes at 273 K (0 C), so 277 K is just a bit higher, maybe 4 C? Hmm, perhaps B is some kind of ice or a hydrate. Alternatively, maybe B is a solid that's formed when G is heated.

Wait, when G is heated, it releases B. So maybe G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into B (like CO2 and something else). Or maybe it's a hydroxide that decomposes into metal oxide and water.

Let me think about the reaction. So X reacts with Y to give gas W, precipitate G, and maybe some other products. When G is heated, it gives B.

Let me think about what X could be. The question says that X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So X is probably something like a strong base or a strong oxidizing agent. For example, it could be something like NaOH, KOH, or maybe a Grignard reagent. Wait, Grignard reagents are organometallic and are used in organic synthesis. But Grignard reagents are usually made from metals like Mg, reacting with haloalkanes.

Wait, but if X is a Grignard reagent, that's an organometallic compound. But then, when it reacts with a liquid Y, perhaps an acid, it would produce a gas. Wait, Grignard reagents react with carboxylic acids to form esters, but maybe in this case, Y is a different kind of acid.

Wait, another thought: X could be a metal, like sodium, potassium, or lithium. If Y is water, then the reaction would be violent, producing H2 gas. But earlier I thought W was H2, which didn't fit the protons and neutrons condition. But maybe W is something else.

Wait, the problem says that the molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. So maybe each molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That would add up to a total of 28 for each molecule. What element has that? Let's see: 14 protons would be silicon, but that's not a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, 8 protons is oxygen. So O has 8p and 8n (^16O). If W is O2, each molecule has 16p and 16n. So that fits.

So W is O2. That suggests that the reaction between X and Y produces O2 gas. Hmm. So what reactions produce O2? Decomposition of peroxides, like H2O2 → 2H2O + O2. Or perhaps a metal reacting with a solution of nitric acid, but that might produce NO or NO2, not O2.

Wait, if X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, and Y is water, then the reaction would be 2Na2O2 + 2H2O → 4NaOH + O2↑. So that reaction would produce O2 as W, NaOH as the product (but it's soluble, so no precipitate)—wait, but in the problem, a precipitate G forms. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Y is another compound. Or perhaps X is a metal, and Y is a solution containing nitrate ions. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: when X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. Let's say that Y is a salt solution. If X is a metal, it might displace another metal, forming a precipitate. But then, what about the gas?

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate. Then the reaction would produce CO2 gas, but earlier I thought W could be O2 or something else.

Wait, if the gas W is O2, then perhaps X is a peroxide reacting with an acid. Let's think: peroxides like H2O2. If X is H2O2, and Y is something else. But H2O2 is a liquid, and Y is also a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a heavier isotope of hydrogen. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So perhaps X is something like D2O (deuterium oxide), which is heavy water. But then, reacting with what? Maybe an acid.

Wait, but if X is a deuterated compound, like CD4 or something else, but that's a stretch.

Wait, let's think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has 2 atoms of oxygen. So, a keto acid is something like a ketone acid, perhaps. For example, if the keto acid is acetone (but that's not an acid). Wait, ketone acids are like (R-CO-R')COOH. So when they react with X, the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a strong base like NaOH. If a keto acid (like a beta-keto acid) reacts with NaOH, perhaps it undergoes a condensation reaction, like forming an enolate. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a product with two oxygen atoms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an ester. But I'm not certain.

Let me try to think about the precipitate G. When X and Y react, G forms, which upon heating gives B. If G is a hydroxide, then heating it might dehydrate it to form a metal oxide. For example, if G is Mg(OH)2, heating would produce MgO and water. But then B would be MgO, which has a high melting point, way above 277 K. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, if G is a carbonate, heating could decompose it to CO2 and metal oxide. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2 upon heating. The melting point of CaO is high, but maybe the question is referring to another compound.

Wait, melting point of B is very close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So B must be a solid at that temperature. What has a melting point near 4 degrees? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps it's ice. Wait, ice melts at 273 K, very close to 277 K. So perhaps B is water (ice), but that's not a solid product of a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate. Wait, maybe G is a hydrated salt, and when heated, it loses water, leaving behind an anhydrous salt (B). For example, if G is Na2CO3·10H2O, heating would give Na2CO3 and water vapor. But the melting point of Na2CO3 is high, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought. Maybe B is a metal with a low melting point. For example, mercury melts at -39°C, which is 234 K. That's lower than 277 K. Lead melts at 327°C (600 K), which is higher. So that doesn't fit. How about another metal? Maybe gallium? Gallium melts around 29°C (302 K), which is close to 277 K? No, that's higher. Hmm, maybe something else.

Wait, maybe B is a solid formed from the reaction. Let me think about the reaction again. Suppose X is a metal, Y is an acid. The reaction produces H2 gas (but that didn't fit the earlier condition). But let's suppose gas W is H2. Then the precipitate G would be a metal hydroxide if Y is an acid. But earlier, I thought W couldn't be H2 because the protons and neutrons don't match. So perhaps I'm wrong about that.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me try to outline what I know:

1. X reacts with Y (a liquid) violently, producing gas W, precipitate G.
2. W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons per molecule.
3. G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.
4. Product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms.
5. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

From point 4: The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, but the product has only two O's? Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination reaction. Or maybe a substitution.

Wait, another angle: The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So the product could be an ester. For example, if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, and X is a base like NaOH. Then, perhaps the product is an enolate or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where X replaces a leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a strong base like KOH. Then, when it reacts with a keto acid, perhaps in a condensation reaction, producing something like a ketone and water. But the product would have certain oxygen atoms. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard reagent, which would add to the keto acid.

Wait, but Grignard reagents are made from haloalkanes and Mg. So maybe X is an organomagnesium compound. When a Grignard reagent reacts with a keto acid (which has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group), perhaps it would add twice to the carbonyl, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a ketone and a strong base like X. Not sure.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to get back to the first part. What is X?

The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe one of the elements in X is a heavier isotope, like deuterium. For example, if X is CH3OD (a deuterated compound), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol) with a heavier isotope, but that doesn't seem relevant.

Wait, another approach. The substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like THF (tetrahydrofuran), DMF (dimethylformamide), or maybe something like DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). Alternatively, maybe it's a solvent like DCM (dichloromethane), but those are more solvents than reagents. Wait, another thought: Maybe X is a strong base like sodium hydride (NaH), which is used in organic reactions.

If X is NaH, then reacting with Y (maybe water) would produce H2 gas. But earlier, that didn't fit because W's molecule needed equal protons and neutrons. Alternatively, if X is NaD (sodium deuteride), then reacting with Y (like D2O) might produce D2 gas.

Wait, but D2 gas has two D atoms. Each D has 1p and 1n. So each molecule of D2 has 2p and 2n. So for each molecule, protons equal neutrons (2=2). That fits the condition for gas W. So W would be D2.

So, in this scenario, X is NaD (sodium deuteride), Y is D2O (heavy water). The reaction would be NaD + D2O → NaOD + 1/2 D2↑. But I'm not sure if that's a typical reaction. I think sodium hydride reacts with water to produce H2, but sodium deuteride would produce D2.

So, if W is D2, then the conditions fit. So moving forward, perhaps X is sodium deuteride (NaD), which is used as a reagent in some reactions, especially in deuterium exchanges.

Now, the product of X (NaD) reacting with a keto acid. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid. NaD is a strong base, so it would deprotonate the keto acid. The product would be the conjugate base. Acetoacetic acid has two acidic protons: one alpha to the ketone and one from the carboxylic acid. NaD would deprotonate the alpha position, perhaps. The product would be the enolate ion. But the question says the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, that doesn't fit because the enolate would have more oxygens.

Wait, maybe the keto acid is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic addition. For example, if the keto acid is an aldehyde, and X is a Grignard reagent (but earlier I thought X was NaD). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction between X and the keto acid is a deprotonation, producing a salt. Let me think: if the keto acid has one acidic proton (maybe the alpha position), and X is a base, then the product would be the conjugate base with a negative charge. But I'm not sure how that leads to a product with two oxygen atoms.

Wait, maybe the product is an acid with two oxygen atoms. For example, if the keto acid loses a proton to form a di-oxygen species. Not sure.

Let me think about the other parts. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If X is NaD, and Y is D2O, the reaction produces NaOD and D2 gas. But NaOD is soluble in D2O, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another compound.

Wait, maybe X is NaOH. Then, Y could be a salt solution, and the reaction produces a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfate, and X is NaOH, the reaction could produce a sodium sulfate solution and a precipitate of a metal hydroxide. But then, when heated, the hydroxide would decompose.

But then, W would be H2. Let's see if that fits. Each H2 molecule has 2p, 0n. So 2p and 0n. Not equal. So that doesn't fit the condition.

Wait, another thought: Maybe W isn't H2 but another gas. Let's go back to the idea that W is O2. How could X and Y produce O2?

If X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, and Y is an acid (like H2SO4), the reaction would be 2 Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + Na2O + H2O + O2↑. So in this case, W is O2. The precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with an acid to produce O2. Wait, metals typically produce H2 when reacting with acids, not O2. Unless it's a reaction involving a hot metal with a strong acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the precipitate G. Suppose G is a carbonate. When heated, it decomposes into CO2 and B (the carbonate breaks down into CO2 and a metal oxide). But then, the metal oxide would be B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Let's say B is sodium oxide (Na2O), which has a melting point around 1380°C, which is way higher than 277 K. That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, like Mg(OH)2, heating it would produce MgO and water. The melting point of MgO is very high, so that doesn't fit either.

Wait, maybe B is a hydrate. For example, if G is a hydrated salt, heating it would drive off water, leaving an anhydrous salt. But the melting point of the anhydrous salt would typically be higher than the hydrated form. Not sure if this helps.

Wait, another idea: What if B is a solid with a low melting point, like elemental sulfur? Sulfur melts around 115°C (388 K), which is a bit higher than 277 K. Hmm, not close enough.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a type of ice. But that doesn't make much sense in the context.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let me think again about the melting point. 277 K is about 4°C. So the solid B would be a solid that melts just above freezing. What about something like ammonium nitrate? No, ammonium nitrate is a crystalline solid with a higher melting point. Wait, maybe it's something like a hydrate that has a low melting point. For example, Na2CO3·10H2O has a melting point around 271 K (about -3°C), which is close to 277 K. So when G is heated, it loses water and becomes anhydrous Na2CO3, which has a higher melting point. But the melting point of the anhydrous form is higher, so maybe this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound entirely. Maybe it's a solid formed from the decomposition of G. Let's think: if G is a carbonate, heating it would produce CO2 and B (the metal oxide). But if B is a metal with a low melting point, like mercury, but I don't think that's the case.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- Gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons per molecule. Possible candidates: O2 (16p,16n), D2 (2p,2n), CH4 (10p,6n—doesn't fit), CO (14p,14n—maybe but I'm not sure. Wait, CO has 14p and 14n? Let me check: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if ^12C), O has 8p and 8n (^16O). So CO has (6+8)=14p and (6+8)=14n. So yes, that fits. So W could be CO.

So if W is CO, then the reaction produces carbon monoxide. Hmm. What reactions produce CO? Maybe the decomposition of a metal carbonate. For example, heating a carbonate can produce CO2, but not CO. Wait, maybe if the carbonate is heated with a reducing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and Y is a solution where the metal displaces another metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another reaction: The reduction of a metal oxide with a carbon-containing substance. But that's more about heating, not a violent reaction between X and Y.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal and Y is a weak acid. The reaction could produce CO. For example, maybe a metal like zinc reacting with a weak acid. But I'm not sure if that would produce CO.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But then W would be C2H2, which doesn't fit the proton and neutron condition.

Hmm, not making progress here. Let me think about the elements in X. The question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So if X contains hydrogen, perhaps it's deuterium. So maybe X is an isotopic compound, like CDCl3, but that's a solvent.

Alternatively, X could be something like CH3OD, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps the product is something simple, like H2O. But that's two oxygen atoms. Wait, but H2O is a molecule with two H and one O. So maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis reaction where X adds to the keto acid to form water. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol with two oxygen atoms. But that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (which has two carboxylic groups?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of X as a base used in organic chemistry, like NaH or KOH. If X is NaH, which is used as a strong base, then perhaps reacting with a keto acid would deprotonate it, forming an enolate. The product would have more oxygen atoms, but the question says it has two. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe X is a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents are used to add to carbonyl groups. For example, if X is CH2MgBr and reacts with a keto acid, perhaps the Grignard adds to the carbonyl, forming an alkoxide, which upon protonation gives an alcohol. But how many oxygen atoms would that product have? The keto acid has O in the ketone and carboxylic acid groups. After adding the Grignard, perhaps the product still retains some oxygen atoms.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible elements in X. The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X has at least two elements, and we need to find their lightest and heaviest and sum their atomic masses.

If X is NaD (sodium deuteride), then the elements are Na and D (which is H). The lightest is H (atomic mass ~1), the heaviest is Na (~23). Sum: 24. But that's not an option in the given choices (options are 25,29,31,35).

Alternatively, if X is NaH, similar to NaD, then elements are Na and H. Sum would be 23+1=24. Still not matching the options.

Another possibility: X contains carbon and oxygen. For example, maybe X is CO2, but that's a gas. Not sure.

Wait, another thought. If X is a metal, like K or Na, which are used as reagents. For example, potassium reacts violently with water to produce H2 gas. But earlier, H2 gas didn't fit the condition. Alternatively, if X is a peroxide like Na2O2, which when reacts with water produces O2 gas.

So let's think again: X is Na2O2. Y is H2O (liquid). Reaction: 2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑. So gas W is O2, which fits the condition of 16p and 16n per molecule.

Precipitate G: In this reaction, NaOH is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps Y is a different solution. Let's say Y is a salt solution where Na2O2 would react to form a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfate. For example, Na2O2 reacting with BaCl2 solution would produce BaO2 (barium peroxide), which is a precipitate. The reaction would be: Na2O2 + BaCl2 → BaO2 + 2 NaCl. But then, the gas produced? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction of Na2O2 with an acid would produce O2 and form a salt.

Wait, if Y is a solution of a metal sulfate, and X is Na2O2, then the reaction could produce a metal peroxide and sodium sulfate, which is soluble, but maybe another salt precipitates.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting too stuck on X being Na2O2. Let me think about the product with the keto acid. If X is Na2O2, and the keto acid reacts with it, perhaps it oxidizes the acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, like zinc, which when reacts with an acid produces H2 gas. But earlier, H2 doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, perhaps W is another gas. Let me think of other possibilities. If each W molecule has equal protons and neutrons, maybe it's CH3+ or something else, but that's not a neutral molecule.

Wait, another possibility: W is He. No, He has 2p and 2n? No, He is Z=2, so 2p and 2n? No, He has 2p and 2n? No, wait, He has 2 electrons, so 2p, and its atomic mass is about 4, so 2n. So He has 2p and 2n. So each He atom has 2p and 2n. But He is a monoatomic gas. So the molecule would be He, and per molecule, 2p and 2n. So that fits. But does the reaction produce He? I don't think so. He is a noble gas and not typically produced in such reactions.

Wait, another possibility: W is NH3. Earlier, I thought each molecule has 10p and 7n, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe another molecule.

Wait, let's think of molecules where the total protons equal the total neutrons. So for a molecule with formula A, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons.

For example, if the molecule is NO: N has 7p, O has 8p. Sum p=15. N has 7n, O has 8n. Sum n=15. So 15p and 15n. That fits.

So W could be NO. Then, what produces NO gas? Typically, reactions involving nitric acid or decomposition of nitrates under certain conditions. But if X and Y react to produce NO, perhaps X is a metal reacting with a nitrate solution. For example, Cu reacting with dilute HNO3 produces NO. But then, the precipitate would be a nitrate salt, which is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a solution of nitrite, producing NO. But then, I'm not sure about the precipitate.

This is getting too tangled. Let me recap what I think:

1. X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Possibilities include NaH, NaOH, Grignard reagents, etc.

2. X incorporates a heavier isotope → perhaps deuterium.

3. Reaction with Y (liquid) produces gas W, which has equal protons and neutrons per molecule. Possible W: O2, D2, CO, NO, etc.

4. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B with a melting point near 277 K.

5. Reaction of X with a keto acid gives a product with 2 oxygen atoms.

Now, considering all, perhaps X is NaH (sodium hydride), which is a strong base used in organic reactions.

Reaction with Y (maybe water) would produce H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit the W condition. So perhaps X is NaD (sodium deuteride), and Y is D2O. Reaction produces D2 gas, which fits the condition (2p and 2n per molecule).

So, W is D2.

Then, the precipitate G might form if Y is a salt solution. For example, if Y is a solution of a sulfate, then NaD (X) might react with it to produce a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carboxylic acid. For example, acetic acid. NaD would deprotonate it, but I don't think that would form a precipitate.

Another thought: Maybe Y is a halide solution. For example, NaD reacting with a solution of AgNO3 would produce AgD (silver deuteride), which is insoluble and forms a precipitate. Silver deuteride has a low solubility, so that could be G. Then, when heated, what happens to AgD? Silver deuteride upon heating might decompose into Ag and D2 gas. So B would be Ag. The melting point of silver is about 961°C (1234 K), which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. If B is something like ice, but that's not a solid formed in a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate. Wait, if G is a hydrate, heating it would release water. For example, if G is Na2CO3·10H2O, heating would release water vapor and leave Na2CO3. But the melting point of Na2CO3 is about 1347°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

Wait, maybe B is a different compound. Let's think of a compound that melts around 277 K. Water (ice) melts at 273 K, which is very close. But B is a product of heating G. So perhaps G is a hydrate that, when heated, releases water (vapor) and leaves a residue. But then B would be water, which is liquid, not solid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle. The product of the reaction between X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Let's say X is NaD. The keto acid has a carboxylic group (COOH) and a ketone (C=O). When X (a strong base) reacts with the keto acid, it deprotonates it to form the enolate. The product would have the enolate ion, but that's a base. Hmm, but the question says the product has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is a diethyl ether or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, replacing a leaving group with X. For example, if X is D- (from NaD), it could replace a halide in the keto acid. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a product with two O's.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to think about the possible answer based on the given options. The options are 25, 29,31,35.

If X contains the lightest element as H (atomic mass ~1) and the heaviest, say, Na (~23), sum is 24. Not an option. So perhaps X contains O and C. For example, if X is CO2, which has C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28. Not an option. Or C and O in another ratio.

Wait, another possibility: X contains D (deuterium, ~2) and O. For example, H2O with one H replaced by D. So the elements are D and O. The lightest is D (2), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 18. Not an option.

Alternatively, X could be something like CH3OD. Elements are C, H, O, D. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16) maybe. Sum is 17. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for X, determine the lightest and heaviest elements present, sum their atomic masses.

If X is Na2O2, the elements are Na and O. Na has atomic mass ~23, O is ~16. Sum is 39. Not an option.

If X is NaH, elements are Na and H. Sum 24. Not an option.

If X is KOH, elements K, O, H. Lightest H (1), heaviest K (~39). Sum 40. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound containing C and O. For example, CO. Then, lightest is C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

Alternatively, X contains C and N. For example, something like CH3NH2. Lightest H (1), heaviest maybe C (12). Sum 13. Not an option.

Hmm. Maybe X contains B and something else. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Maybe the product is a molecule like CH3OH (methanol), which has one O. No. Alternatively, maybe it's something like H2O, which has one O. Hmm, not two.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone with two O atoms. For example, acetone has (CH3)2CO, which has one O. No.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carboxylic acid derivative. For example, if X is a base and it deprotonates the keto acid, the product would be the conjugate base, which has more O's. Not sure.

I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options for the sum are 25,29,31,35. So possible combinations are:

- 1 (H) + 24 (Mg) =25 → option B.
- 12 (C) + 17 (Cl) =29 → option D.
- 15 (P) + 16 (O)=31 → option C.
- 14 (N) + 21 (Ca)=35 → option A.

So perhaps X contains Mg and H (as in MgH2?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, if X is MgH2, which is a compound, then the lightest is H (1), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum is 25.3, which rounds to 25. Option B is 25.

But is MgH2 a known compound? I think magnesium hydride exists, but it's not very common. Alternatively, perhaps X is NaH, which has Na (23) and H (1), sum 24. Not an option.

Alternatively, if X is CaH2, which is a known compound, then Ca has atomic mass ~40, H is 1. Sum is 41. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: If X is LiAlH4 (a strong reducing agent), then the elements are Li (7), Al (27), H (1). The lightest is H (1), heaviest Al (27). Sum is 28. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, if X is something like NH4H (ammonium hydride), but I don't think that's a real compound.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal carbide, like SiC. Then, the elements are Si (28) and C (12). Sum is 40. Not in options.

Alternatively, if X is a heavier element with H, like RbH. Rb has ~85. Sum would be 86. No.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with B and H, like BH3. B is 11, H is 1. Sum 12. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains O and F. For example, O has 16, F has 19. Sum 35. Option A is 35. Does that make sense?

If X is something like OF2, which is a diatomic molecule. But OF2 is a highly reactive and unstable compound. It's not commonly used as a reagent. Alternatively, perhaps X is FOOF (tetrafluorooxygen), but that's even more exotic.

Alternatively, maybe X is a perfluoride, like F2O. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The problem states that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So perhaps one of the elements in X is a heavier isotope, but that doesn't change the identity of the element. So the isotopes don't affect the elements present.

So, the elements present in X determine the sum. Let's say X contains F and O. Then sum would be 19 (F) +16 (O) =35, option A.

But why would X be a compound of F and O? Maybe X is something like O2F2, which is difluorine oxide. But I don't think that's a common reagent.

Alternatively, maybe X is a compound like HFO (hexafluoropropylene oxide), but that's a stretch.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the options.

Option D is 29, which is 12 (C) +17 (Cl) =29. So if X contains C and Cl, perhaps as in CHCl3 (chloroform). But chloroform is a solvent, not a reagent. Alternatively, maybe X is CCl4, but again, it's a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CH2Cl2, but not a reagent.

Alternatively, maybe X is a keto acid itself, but the question says it's a reagent.

Hmm. Another angle: The product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. Let's imagine that X is a base that neutralizes the keto acid's acidic proton, forming a salt with two O atoms. For example, if the keto acid is HOOCCO2H (tartaric acid), and X is NaOH, the product would be NaOOCCO2Na, which has more O's. Hmm, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a condensation reaction, forming a molecule with two O's. For example, forming an acetal from a keto acid. But that would require something like an alcohol and acid catalyst, not sure.

This is really challenging. Since time is limited, I'll have to make a best guess.

Based on the options, and considering that X is a reagent in organic chemistry that could be NaH or NaD, which sum to ~24 (but not an option), the next possibility is that X contains C and Cl, summing to 12+17=29 (option D). Alternatively, if X is something like C2H5Cl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The product of a keto acid with X has two O's. Suppose X is a reducing agent, like LiAlH4. When LiAlH4 reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone), it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. The product would have an additional O. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester, which would have more O's. Not sure.

I think I'm stuck and will have to make a guess. Given the options, and considering that D) 29 is a possible sum of C (12) and Cl (17), I'll go with that. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: The melting point of B is close to 277 K. If B is H2O (ice), which melts at 273 K. So B is H2O. So when G is heated, it releases H2O. But how?

If G is a hydrate, like a copper sulfate pentahydrate, heating it would release water vapor. But then, what is G? If G is a hydrated salt, then X would be a base that reacts to form the hydrated salt.

Wait, perhaps X is Na2CO3. If Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide, perhaps reacting to form a sodium salt and a precipitate. For example, if Y is Fe(OH)3, then reacting with Na2CO3 might not form a precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. When it reacts with an acid, it produces CO2 gas. So W is CO2. Each CO2 molecule has 12p (6 from C, 6 from 2 O) and 12n (6 from C, 8*2=16 from O? Wait, no. C is ^12C (6n), each O is ^16O (8n), so total n:6 + 2*8 =22. p:6 + 2*8=22. So each CO2 molecule has 22p and 22n. So that fits the condition.

So W is CO2. Then, the reaction between X (a carbonate) and Y (an acid) produces CO2 gas, a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B (which is H2O, melting at 273 K).

But wait, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is HCl, the reaction is Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. But that doesn't form a precipitate. So perhaps Y is a solution that when reacts with X produces a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of Ba(NO3)2, and X is Na2CO3. Then, the reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate, NaNO3 solution, and CO2 gas.

So G is BaCO3. When heated, BaCO3 decomposes into BaO and CO2. But then, what is B? It would be CO2 gas, which is a gas, not a solid. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps G is CaCO3, which when heated decomposes into CaO and CO2. But then B is CO2, which is a gas. But the problem says B is a solid with a melting point near 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that upon heating loses water. For example, if G is Fe(OH)3, heating would produce Fe2O3 and water vapor. But then B is H2O, which is liquid, not solid.

This is getting too complicated. I think I'll have to make a guess based on the options and the information I have.

If I consider that X is NaH (sodium hydride), which is a strong base used in organic reactions. Then, the elements in X are Na (23) and H (1). The sum is 24. But that's not an option.

Another possibility: X contains O and F. For example, O has 16, F has 19. Sum 35. That's option A. Maybe X is something like FOOF (tetrafluorooxygen), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a compound like ClO2, but that's a gas.

Wait, another thought: X could be a heavy water isotope, like HOD. Then, the elements are H, O, D. The lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options and the earlier consideration of CO2 as gas W, perhaps X contains C and O. So, if X is CO2, but that's a gas, and the sum would be 12+16=28. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is something like CCl4, then C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum is about 47.5, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, X is CH3Cl, which has C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum ~47.5. No.

Alternatively, X is something like CH2O (formaldehyde), which has C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest H, heaviest O. Sum 17. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CHCl3. Then, elements are C (12), H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest H, heaviest Cl. Sum 12+35.5=47.5. Not an option.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, I'll have to go with the best guess. The correct answer is likely option C) 31, which would be 15 (P) + 16 (O) =31. But I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Wait, another thought: The product of X and a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Maybe X is P, which when reacts with a keto acid forms something with two O's. For example, maybe phosphoric acid.

Alternatively, if X is PCl3, which is used in organic reactions. Then, elements are P and Cl. Sum would be 31 (P) + 35.5 (Cl) =66.5. Not an option.

Hmm. I think I'm out of time. I'll go with option C) 31, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves identifying a substance \( X \) that reacts violently with a liquid \( Y \), producing a gas \( W \) whose molecule has an equal number of protons and neutrons. A precipitate \( G \) forms, which releases \( B \) upon heating, where \( B \) has a melting point close to 277 K. Additionally, the product of \( X \) reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms, and \( X \) is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The task is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in \( X \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas \( W \):** The molecule of \( W \) has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include \( O_2 \) (16p, 16n), \( D_2 \) (2p, 2n), \( CO \) (14p, 14n), or \( NO \) (15p, 15n). These possibilities were explored, but the exact identity of \( W \) remained unclear.

2. **Precipitate \( G \) and \( B \):** The precipitate \( G \) forms when \( X \) reacts with \( Y \), and heating \( G \) releases \( B \), which has a melting point near 277 K (approximately 4°C). This suggests \( B \) could be a low-melting solid, possibly a hydrate or a simple compound. However, the exact nature of \( G \) and \( B \) was not definitively determined.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid:** The product of \( X \) and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This implies a reaction mechanism that simplifies the oxygen count, possibly through deprotonation or substitution. However, the exact reaction pathway was not fully resolved.

4. **Elements in \( X \):** \( X \) incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, suggesting it could involve isotopes like deuterium (\( D \)) or a heavier isotope of oxygen or carbon. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in \( X \) were to be calculated.

5. **Options Analysis:**
   - **Option A (35):** Suggests elements with atomic masses summing to 35, such as \( N \) (14) and \( Ca \) (21). However, no clear evidence linked \( X \) to these elements.
   - **Option B (25):** Suggests elements like \( H \) (1) and \( Mg \) (24), summing to 25. This could correspond to compounds like \( MgH_2 \), but \( MgH_2 \) is not commonly associated with the described reactivity.
   - **Option C (31):** Suggests elements like \( P \) (31) and \( O \) (16), summing to 31. This aligns with compounds like \( PO \), but no definitive evidence linked \( X \) to these elements.
   - **Option D (29):** Suggests elements like \( C \) (12) and \( Cl \) (17), summing to 29. This could correspond to compounds like \( CHCl_3 \), but such compounds are not typically described as reagents in the given context.

### Conclusion:
After extensive analysis, the reasoning process concluded with the best guess based on the options provided. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in \( X \) were most consistent with **Option C (31)**, though the exact identity of \( X \) remained uncertain.

**Answer: C**
