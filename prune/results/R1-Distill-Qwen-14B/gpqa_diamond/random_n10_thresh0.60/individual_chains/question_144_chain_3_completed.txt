Okay, so I've got this problem about a meson resonance and I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that particles like mesons can decay, and the distance they travel before decaying depends on their lifetime. But wait, how do all the given parameters tie into that?

The parameters given are E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Oh right, the width is related to the particle's lifetime. The mean lifetime τ is inversely proportional to the width Γ, right? So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh yeah, and I might need to convert units here because the width is given in MeV and the energy in GeV.

Wait, so first, I should probably calculate the lifetime τ. Let me jot that down. τ = ħ / Γ. But what's the value of ħ in units that will cancel with GeV and give seconds? Hmm, I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, but the width Γ is given in MeV. So I need to convert Γ from MeV to GeV to keep the units consistent. So 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is roughly 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, wait, let me double-check that math. 0.32 times 20 is 6.4, so 6.582 is about 20.56875 times 0.32. Yeah, that's right.

Once I have the lifetime τ, the next step is to find the mean decay distance. The distance L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. L = v * τ. But what's the velocity v of the meson?

Since the meson is a resonance, it's produced with a certain energy E. The energy is given as 8 GeV. To find the velocity, I can use the relativistic energy equation: E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Alternatively, since E is much larger than m, maybe I can approximate v as being close to the speed of light c. Wait, but let's calculate it properly.

The meson's rest mass m is 1.2 GeV. So E = 8 GeV, m c² = 1.2 GeV. So γ = E / (m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ is about 6.6667. Then, using the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), I can solve for v. Let me rearrange that.

γ² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²) → 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/(γ²) → v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Let me plug in γ = 6.6667. 1/γ² is approximately 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root gives sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. That's pretty close to the speed of light, as expected since E is much larger than m.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the velocity using the relation v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)). Let me see: m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So (m c²/E)^2 = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775, same as before. So sqrt gives 0.9887, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So now, to compute the mean decay distance L = v * τ. Let me compute each part.

First, v is approximately 0.9887 c. c is about 3e8 m/s. So 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, but let me think about the units. Wait, τ is in seconds, so L = v * τ.

So v is 0.9887 c ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approx 2.966e8 m/s.

So τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Multiplying v and τ: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = Let's compute that.

First, 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's approximate. 3 * 2 =6, but 2.966 is about 2.966, 2.056875 is about 2.057.

2.966 * 2.057: Let's compute:

2 * 2 =4, 2 * 0.057=0.114, 0.966 * 2=1.932, 0.966 * 0.057≈0.055.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 2.966 * 2.057 = ?

Let me compute 2.966 * 2 =5.932. 2.966 * 0.057 = 0.167682. So total is 5.932 + 0.167682 ≈6.099682.

So 6.099682e8 * 1e-24 =6.099682e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait. 2.966e8 * 2.056e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (approx 6.102) * 1e-16 = 6.102e-16 meters.

But looking at the options, the options are around 1e-15 or 1e-16. So my calculation is about 6e-16, but the options are 4e-15, 5e-15, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating τ. Let me double-check that.

Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau is ħ / Γ. ħ ≈6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

Hmm, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 seconds is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should have considered the natural units where ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because in this calculation, I used GeV, so I think it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should have converted the width to GeV correctly. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Let me recheck that.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

So gamma (γ) is E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666667.

Then, β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

So m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So (m c² / E )² = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

Thus, 1 - 0.0225 =0.9775. sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈0.9887 c.

So v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L is 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2.056875.

2.966 * 2 =5.932

2.966 * 0.056875 = about 0.1678.

So total is approximately 6.0998, so 6.10e8 * 1e-24 =6.10e-16 meters.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A) 5.0223e-16 m or D) 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, my calculation is around 6e-16, but the options are lower. Did I make an error?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Wait, gamma is E/(m c^2), but E is the total energy, which is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the velocity can be approximated as v ≈ c when E >> m. Since 8 GeV is much larger than 1.2 GeV, v is very close to c. So perhaps I can approximate beta as 1, which would make L = c * tau.

Wait, let me try that. If v ≈ c, then L = c * tau.

So c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L ≈ 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.17e-16 meters.

Still about 6e-16, which isn't matching any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the mean lifetime using the formula tau = ħ / (Gamma), but I might have made a mistake in the units.

Wait, ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So in this case, Gamma is in GeV, so when we compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32, that's correct.

Wait, but if the width is in MeV, perhaps I should have converted it to GeV correctly. Because 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the decay length is different. Maybe it's L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Wait, wait, I think I might have missed a factor of gamma in the lifetime.

Because the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma, and the moving lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

Ah yes! Because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. So tau = gamma * tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame).

Wait, so correct approach:

Proper lifetime tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

So I think I made a mistake earlier. I calculated tau as tau_0, but actually it's gamma * tau_0.

Wait, let's go back.

Gamma (width) is 0.32 GeV.

Tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.

But the lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

Since gamma is 6.6667, tau = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Wait, wait, no, 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 is:

First, 6 * 2.056875e-24 is 1.234125e-23.

0.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.371e-24.

Wait, no, 6.6667 is approximately 6 and 2/3, so 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = let me compute 6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23, and 0.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.371e-24. So total is approx 1.371e-24 + 1.234125e-23 = 1.371e-24 + 1.234125e-23 = 1.371e-24 + 12.34125e-24 = 13.712e-24 = 1.3712e-23 seconds.

So tau = gamma * tau_0 ≈ 1.3712e-23 s.

Then, the velocity v is 0.9887 c ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So decay length L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.3712e-23 s.

Calculating that: 2.966e8 * 1.3712e-23 = (2.966 * 1.3712) * 1e8 *1e-23.

Compute 2.966 * 1.3712.

Let me approximate:

2.966 * 1 = 2.966,

2.966 * 0.3712 ≈ 2.966 * 0.3 = 0.8898, 2.966 * 0.0712 ≈ 0.2106.

So total ≈ 0.8898 + 0.2106 ≈ 1.0998. So 2.966 + 1.0998=4.0658.

So 4.0658 * 1e-15 m. Because 1e8 *1e-23=1e-15.

So L ≈4.0658e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15. So the correct answer is approximately 4.065e-15, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of 2.966 * 1.3712.

Wait, more accurately:

2.966 * 1.3712.

Let me compute it step by step.

1.3712 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.0012.

2.966 * 1 = 2.966.

2.966 * 0.3 = 0.8898.

2.966 * 0.07 = 0.20762.

2.966 * 0.0012 ≈ 0.0035592.

Adding these up:

2.966 + 0.8898 = 3.8558.

3.8558 + 0.20762 = 4.06342.

4.06342 + 0.0035592 ≈4.067.

So about 4.067e-15 m. So the calculation gives approximately 4.067e-15 m, which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m) closely.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we start by calculating the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \), which is given by:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \)) and \( \Gamma \) is the width of the resonance (\( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \)). Substituting the values:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

Next, we account for time dilation in the lab frame. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated using the energy \( E \) and the rest mass \( m \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8 \, \text{GeV}}{1.2 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 6.6667
\]

The lifetime in the lab frame is then:

\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.3712 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

The velocity \( v \) of the meson is approximated using the relativistic relation:

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]

Substituting \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\frac{m^2}{E^2} = \frac{(1.2)^2}{(8)^2} = \frac{1.44}{64} \approx 0.0225
\]

\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = c \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887 \, c
\]

Using \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the velocity is:

\[
v \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

The mean decay distance is then:

\[
L = v \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8) \times (1.3712 \times 10^{-23})
\]

\[
L \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the closest match is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
