Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the compound X is and what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm. Let's start by analyzing the spectral data provided.

First, the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But since there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is more typical for a ketone or maybe an ester. But wait, carboxylic acids usually show a broad peak around 2500-3000 for O-H. Let me check the NMR for any evidence of that.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton (RCHO) or maybe an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, the integration is 1H. If it were a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but maybe that's the case here. But wait, the IR has a peak around 1720, which could fit a ketone or aldehyde. An aldehyde's proton is around 9-10 ppm, so 10.5 is a bit upfield for an aldehyde, but maybe possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a phenol? But then the IR wouldn
