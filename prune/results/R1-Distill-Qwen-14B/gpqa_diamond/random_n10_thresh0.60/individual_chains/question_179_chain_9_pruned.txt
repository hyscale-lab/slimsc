Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through each option carefully.

First, let me list out the given matrices:

W is:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

X is:
i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z is:
3    2i    5
-2i  -2  -4i
5    4i    4

The options are A to D, each making a statement about these matrices.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm, so this is about whether the matrix exponential e^X is unitary. Because in quantum mechanics, the evolution operator must be unitary to preserve the norm of the state vector. If e^X is not unitary, then multiplying a vector by e^X could change its norm. But wait, unitary matrices have the property that their exponential is also unitary only under certain conditions. Or does the exponential of a Hermitian matrix stay unitary? Wait, actually, no. Wait, no, let me think. The exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Because if H is Hermitian, then iH is skew-Hermitian, and e^{iH} is unitary.

Wait, but X is a matrix. Let me check if X is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. So, let's compute X's conjugate transpose.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Conjugate transpose (X†) would be the transpose of the conjugate of each element:

So, each entry (i,j) becomes the conjugate of (j,i) in X.

So, X†:
First row is [i*, 1*, 2i*] → [ -i, 1, -2i ]

Wait, let me compute each element properly:

X† would have entries:

(1,1): conjugate of X(1,1) → i → -i
(1,2): conjugate of X(2,1) → 1 → 1
(1,3): conjugate of X(3,1) → 2i → -2i
(2,1): conjugate of X(1,2) → -1 → -1
(2,2): X(2,2) is 0, so stays 0.
(2,3): conjugate of X(3,2) → -1 → -1
(3,1): conjugate of X(1,3) → 2i → -2i
(3,2): conjugate of X(2,3) → 1 → 1
(3,3): conjugate of X(3
