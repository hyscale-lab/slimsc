Okay, I need to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is a dienophile, so this sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction. Right, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds.

Wait, what's the structure of 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene? Cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, right? So 1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4 positions. The fluorine is at position 5. Let me visualize that. So it's a cyclopentane ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, and a fluorine atom attached to carbon 5.

When it reacts with maleic anhydride, a Diels-Alder reaction happens. The diene is 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Wait, but waitâ€”is that the diene or the dienophile? Because cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, so it should act as the diene here. Maleic anhydride is the dienophile.

So in the Diels-Alder reaction, the electron-rich diene (the cyclopentadiene derivative) reacts with the electron-poor dienophile (maleic anhydride). The reaction forms a six-membered cyclohexene derivative, with the substituents from the dienophile ending up in the endo position.

Wait but wait, the di
