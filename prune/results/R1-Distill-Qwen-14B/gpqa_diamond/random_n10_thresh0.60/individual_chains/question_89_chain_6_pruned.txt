Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by going through each part of the question.

First, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably E2, to form an alkene. So, the product here should be an adamantane derivative with a double bond.

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, that IR peak is around 1700, which usually indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). Hmm, but wait, if the initial reaction is elimination to form an alkene, where's the carbonyl coming from? Oh, wait! Maybe I'm thinking wrong. Alternatively, could it be an epoxide? Because sometimes when dihalides are treated with a base, especially in certain conditions, they can form epoxides. Oh, but wait, KOH under what conditions? If it's a strong base and the dihalide is vicinal, elimination would form the alkene. Alternatively, if it's a dihalide with adjacent leaving groups, perhaps it's forming a diepoxide? No,
