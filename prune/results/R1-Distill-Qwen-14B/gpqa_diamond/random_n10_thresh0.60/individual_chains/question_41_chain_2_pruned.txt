Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, right. The speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, right. Since the glass is moving, I think we need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed. Because when the medium is moving, I remember something about the Doppler effect or maybe relativistic effects. But wait, since the glass is moving at a constant velocity, not accelerated, maybe it's just a matter of combining velocities.

Wait, but light speed is a tricky thing. Oh, right, in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is a bit different. Because the glass is moving, but the light is already in the glass. So what's the speed of the light as observed by someone in the lab?

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the beam. Wait, does that mean the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer too? Or is the
