Alright, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the luminosities of two stars. Let me read the question carefully.

Okay, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The stars' brightest wavelengths are the same, which probably relates to their temperatures. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're supposed to find how much greater Star_1's luminosity is compared to Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, black body radiation—so I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're comparing two stars, the constants will cancel out, so I can focus on the ratio.

The question mentions the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max ≈ b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because if T1 = T2, then λ_max1 = λ_max2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says they have the same wavelengths where they appear brightest. But if their temperatures are the same, their luminosities would depend on their radii. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴. Oh, but since T is the same, L is proportional to R².

So Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Let me compute the luminosity ratio. L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the T terms are 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be option A, right? But wait, the options given are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc.

But wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the luminosity calculation?

Ah, I think this is about Doppler shift. The observed wavelength from a moving star would be different due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max is the same, but their actual temperatures might be different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait a minute, no. Because if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength is shifted. So the observed λ_max would be different if the star is moving. So if the stars have the same observed λ_max, but their actual temperatures are different due to Doppler shift, then the initial assumption that their temperatures are the same might not hold.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The star's actual temperature determines λ_max. If the star is moving, the observed λ_max would be shifted. So if both stars have the same observed λ_max, but one is moving and the other isn't, their actual temperatures could be different.

So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity
