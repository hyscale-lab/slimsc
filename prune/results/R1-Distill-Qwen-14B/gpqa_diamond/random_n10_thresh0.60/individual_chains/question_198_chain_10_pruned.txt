Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. It's about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The question involves stability constants and the percentage of a particular complex among all cobalt species.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when a metal ion is in solution with a ligand, they can form different complexes. Each complex has a certain stability, which is given by the stability constant, beta (β). The higher the beta, the more stable the complex.

The problem gives me the stability constants for four cobalt thiocyanato complexes. The β values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit strange because β3 is the largest. So the order of stability would be β3 > β2 > β4 > β1? Wait, no, because β is the formation constant. So a higher β means more stable. So β3 is theOkay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the question is about complex ion formation. I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. Because I remember that the different SCN- ligands around Co give different colors. Like, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is a different color than the dithiocyanato one. Oh, wait, but in this case, the specific complexes have different β values. The β's are given as β1 to β4, so I need to figure out which complex corresponds to each.

Wait, the stability constants are for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n
