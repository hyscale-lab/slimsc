Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

First, the question gives me the molecular formula C8H9NO and an NMR spectrum. Then, the compound undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find out what the final product is from the options given.

Let's break it down. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So putting in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That's either five rings, or a combination of rings and double bonds. Since it's an organic compound, likely a combination. Probably a benzene ring (which accounts for 4, since it's a six-membered ring with 3 double bonds) and a double bond or ring plus a carbonyl group. 

Looking at the NMR data: 

9.72 ppm triplet (1H). That's a region typical for an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two equivalent protons. Wait, but an aldehyde has only one proton, so maybe it's a triplet due to coupling with two adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an aldehyde? Hmm.

Next peak: 6.98 ppm doublet (2H). That's usually aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted ring, as in a para-disubstituted benzene. The doublet suggests they're each coupled with one neighboring proton. Wait, no, in para substitution, each proton has two neighboring protons, but actually, wait, in para substitution, each proton is adjacent to two protons on the ring. But in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are equivalent, so the splitting would be different. Maybe this is part of a di-substituted benzene, like ortho or para substitution. Alternatively, it could be a doublet because it's coupling with a neighboring group, like in a coupling with another aromatic ring or another substituent.

Then 6.51 ppm doublet (2H). Another pair of aromatic protons, perhaps in another ring? Or maybe part of an aromatic ring with substituents. The chemical shifts suggest that these are in a different environment than the 6.98 ppm protons.

6.27 ppm broad singlet (2H). Broad singlet, so maybe these are protons adjacent to an electrondonating group, like an -OH. Or maybe they're in a conjugated system, like allylic protons. Alternatively, maybe these are protons on an aromatic ring with adjacent substituents, like if they're ortho to a substituent.

3.66 ppm doublet (2H). That's around the region for CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to an
