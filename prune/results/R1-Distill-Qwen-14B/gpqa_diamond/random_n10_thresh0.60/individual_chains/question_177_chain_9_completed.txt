Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question says.

So we're looking at two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The information given is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the luminosity is what we're after here. The question says that the astronomers found the same wavelength at which the stars appeared brightest. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength for each star's emission.

Wait, but stars radiate as black bodies, so I think we can use Wien's Law here. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the star. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. Oh wait, no, wait. Did the question say their wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same? So λ_max for both is same. So that would imply same temperature. Oh, because if their λ_max is the same, then their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait, the problem says Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelength. So their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2 = T.

So now, the next thing is to calculate the luminosity of each star. Luminosity for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So since both stars have same T, the luminosity will depend on R². So L is proportional to R² T⁴, and since T is same, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, let's compute that. R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that gives (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, that's the initial thought. But wait, the options are A) ~2.25, which is that. But wait, the problem says that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a factor, so 2.25 would be the factor. So the answer would be option A, right?

But wait, the question also mentions radial velocities. Oh, wait, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, wait, so how does that factor into the problem? Because when we observe a star's spectrum, the Doppler effect can shift the wavelengths. Oh right! The star's velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler shift.

So if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and if moving away, it's redshifted. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ), but that's when v_r is much smaller than c, you can approximate it with λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c). Wait, but wait, depending on the direction. Since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, but we need to know if it's moving towards or away from us. The problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, but doesn't specify direction. Oh, wait, radial velocity is usually given as positive when moving away (redshift) and negative when moving towards (blueshift). But that's convention.

Wait, but the problem states that the peak wavelengths observed are the same. So the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1, and for Star_2 it's λ2. But according to the problem, λ1 = λ2.

Wait, but wait. If the stars' rest wavelengths are λ_rest1 and λ_rest2, but due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelengths are different. But in this problem, the observed wavelengths are the same. So how does that affect their actual temperatures?

Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake earlier in assuming that the stars have the same T because their observed λ_max are same. But in reality, their observed λ_max is same, but their actual λ_rest may be different because of their velocities.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The peak wavelength observed (λ_obs) is the same for both stars. But the actual rest frame wavelength (λ_rest) would be different if their velocities are different. So when I thought that T1 = T2, that's only true if the observed λ_max equals the rest λ_max, which isn't the case here.

Wait, no, let's think again. The problem says that the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So for each star, their own λ_max (in their rest frame) is determined by their temperature. But when observed, their λ_max might shift due to Doppler effect.

Wait, but the question states that the observed λ_max are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. But λ_obs is the wavelength we see, which is different from the rest frame wavelength. So for each star, their rest λ_max is given by Wien's law: λ_rest = b / T. But when we observe them, their λ_obs is λ_rest multiplied by a Doppler factor.

So for Star_1, which has v_r1=0: λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, which has v_r2=700 km/s: λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) ) ), assuming v_r2 is positive (moving away, so redshift).

Wait, but the problem states that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

So I can cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Which can be rearranged to T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c) )

Assuming v_r2 is positive, which would mean the star is moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) than its rest frame. Therefore, T1 would be less than T2 because the sqrt term is less than 1.

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1's luminosity is being compared to Star_2's. So perhaps I can express L1 and L2 in terms of their rest frame parameters.

Wait, the problem says that the stars are radiating as black bodies, so their luminosity would be as per their rest frame. But when observed, their flux might be affected by their velocities, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on their black body radiation. Hmm, perhaps the luminosity calculation is done in the rest frame of the stars, but the observed flux would be affected by the Doppler effect.

Wait, no, the problem says astronomers computed the luminosity via black body radiation. So perhaps they used the observed wavelengths to determine the star's rest properties. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed luminosity, but we're to compute the actual luminosity, not the observed flux.

Wait, but it's unclear. Let me read the problem again.

"Through spectroscopy, the astronomers managed to determine the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same."

So the observed λ_max is same for both. Then, from that, using black body radiation, they compute the luminosity.

Wait, but the luminosity depends on the star's intrinsic properties (radius and temperature). So perhaps the way I initially thought is incorrect. Because the observed λ_max is same, but the actual λ_rest is different because of velocity.

So to find the actual temperatures, I need to account for the Doppler shift.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, for each star, the observed λ_max is same. Let's denote this observed wavelength as λ_obs.

So for Star_1, which has v_r1 = 0 km/s,

λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 * (1 + v_r1 / c) ≈ λ_rest1 (since v_r1=0, no shift).

For Star_2, with v_r2=700 km/s (assuming moving away, so positive),
λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But the problem says λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ_obs.

So for Star_1, λ_rest1 = λ_obs.

For Star_2, λ_rest2 = λ_obs / (1 + v_r2/c).

But according to Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T, so:

For Star_1: T1 = b / λ_rest1 = b / λ_obs.

For Star_2: T2 = b / λ_rest2 = b * (1 + v_r2/c) / λ_obs.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, because λ_rest2 = λ_obs / (1 + v_r2/c), so T2 = b / λ_rest2 = b (1 + v_r2/c) / λ_obs = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, but that would mean that T2 is higher than T1, because (1 + v_r2/c) is greater than 1.

But how do we use this in the luminosity calculation?

Luminosity is L = 4π R² σ T^4.

So for each star:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2^4.

We can write L1/L2 as (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2,

So (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

So T2^4 = [T1 (1 + v_r2/c)]^4 = T1^4 (1 + v_r2/c)^4.

So substitute into L1/L2:

L1/L2 = [ (2.25) * T1^4 ] / [ R2^2 (T1^4 (1 + v_r2/c)^4 ) / R2^2 ].

Wait, wait, let me get that right. Let me write L1/L2:

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4) = [ (R1/R2)^2 ] * [ T1^4 / T2^4 ].

We know R1/R2 is 1.5, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25.

T2 is T1 * (1 + v_r2/c), so T2^4 is T1^4 (1 + v_r2/c)^4.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)^4.

So putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ 1 / (1 + v_r2/c)^4 ].

Now, v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute (v_r2 / c). The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So (v_r2/c) ≈ 0.02333.

So (1 + v_r2/c) ≈ 1.02333.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. Let's see:

(1.02333)^2 = approx (1.02333)^2. Let's compute:

1.02333^2 = 1 + 2*(0.02333) + (0.02333)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.0472.

Then, (1.0472)^2 ≈ ?

1.0472^2: 1 + 2*0.0472 + (0.0472)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0944 + 0.002227 ≈ 1.0966.

Wait, wait, or perhaps it's better to compute it step by step more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach.

Let me compute (1.02333)^4.

Compute 1.02333 raised to the 4th power.

First, compute 1.02333^2:

1.02333 * 1.02333:

Let me compute it:

1.02333 * 1.02333 ≈ (1 + 0.02333) * (1 + 0.02333) = 1 + 2*0.02333 + 0.02333^2.

0.02333^2 ≈ 0.000544.

So 1 + 0.04666 + 0.000544 ≈ 1.047204.

So (1.02333)^2 ≈ 1.047204.

Then, square that to get to the 4th power:

1.047204^2 ≈ ?

Compute 1.047204 * 1.047204.

Let me approximate:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.047204 = 0.047204.

0.047204 * 1 = 0.047204.

0.047204 * 0.047204 ≈ 0.002228.

So adding the cross terms:

= 1 + 2*(0.047204) + 0.002228.

= 1 + 0.094408 + 0.002228 ≈ 1.096636.

So (1.02333)^4 ≈ 1.096636.

So 1/(1.096636) ≈ 0.9118.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9118 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9118.

Compute 2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.0118 = approximately 0.02655.

So total is about 2.025 + 0.02655 ≈ 2.05155.

Wait, that's approximately 2.05, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are all over 2.2 or so. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I accounted for the Doppler shift.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact Doppler shift formula. Let me think again. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) )

Wait, but that's for when the source is moving away. Alternatively, when the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So the formula could be:

λ_obs = λ_rest * ( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) )^(1/2).

So when calculating the rest wavelength, λ_rest = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v_r/c)/(1 + v_r/c) ) ).

So for Star_2, which has v_r2=700 km/s, moving away, so:

λ_rest2 = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c)/(1 + v_r2/c) )

Because λ_obs is λ_rest2 multiplied by the Doppler factor.

Wait, but as per the earlier conclusion, since λ_obs1 = λ_obs, and for Star_1, λ_rest1 = λ_obs.

So for Star_2, λ_rest2 = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c)/(1 + v_r2/c) ) ).

So then, using Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T.

So,

T1 = b / λ_rest1 = b / λ_obs,

T2 = b / λ_rest2 = b / [ λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c)/(1 + v_r2/c) ) ) ] = (b / λ_obs) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

Wait, since (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) is greater than 1, so sqrt(that) is greater than 1, so T2 is higher than T1.

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

So now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is [ (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ) ].

As before, R1 = 1.5 R2, so (R1/R2)^2 is 2.25.

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

So T2^4 = T1^4 * [ (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ) ]^2.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25) * [ T1^4 / (T1^4 * [ (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ) ]^2 ) ]

Simplify:

= 2.25 * [ 1 / ( [ (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) ) ]^2 ) ]

= 2.25 * [ ( (1 - v_r2/c)/(1 + v_r2/c) ) ) ]^2.

Which is 2.25 * [ (1 - v_r2/c) / (1 + v_r2/c) ) ]^2.

Now, let's compute this.

v_r2 is 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s.

v_r2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So,

(1 - 0.023333) ≈ 0.976667.

(1 + 0.023333) ≈ 1.023333.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ approximately 0.9544.

Then, squaring that gives (0.9544)^2 ≈ 0.9113.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9113 ≈ 2.052.

Hmm, that's about 2.05, but the options are around 2.23 to 2.35. So this isn't matching. Did I make a calculation mistake?

Wait, perhaps my calculation of (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) is off. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.976667 / 1.023333.

Let me compute 0.976667 ÷ 1.023333.

Let me approximate:

1.023333 * 0.95 = approximately 0.97216685.

Which is less than 0.976667. Let me compute 0.95 * 1.023333 = 0.97216685.

Difference: 0.976667 - 0.97216685 = 0.00450015.

So how much more than 0.95? Let me find x in 0.95 + x = (0.976667)/(1.023333).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 0.976667 ÷ 1.023333.

Let me compute it as:

Let me approximate 1.023333 as 1.023333 ≈ 1.0233.

So 1 / 1.0233 ≈ 0.9769.

So 0.976667 * 0.9769 ≈ ?

0.976667 * 0.9769 ≈ let's compute step by step.

0.976667 * 0.9769 ≈ 0.976667 * (1 - 0.0231) ≈ 0.976667 - 0.976667 * 0.0231.

Compute 0.976667 * 0.0231 ≈ 0.02255.

So approximate 0.976667 - 0.02255 ≈ 0.9541.

So the ratio is approximately 0.9541.

So [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ] = 0.9541.

Squaring this gives (0.9541)^2.

0.95^2 is 0.9025.

0.0041^2 is negligible. But more accurately:

0.9541 * 0.9541.

Compute 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025.

0.95 * 0.0041 = 0.003895.

0.0041 * 0.95 = same as above.

0.0041 * 0.0041 is negligible.

So,

= (0.95 + 0.0041) * (0.95 + 0.0041) 

= 0.95^2 + 2*(0.95)(0.0041) + 0.0041^2

≈ 0.9025 + 0.00782 + 0.00001681 ≈ 0.9103.

So [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ]^2 ≈ 0.9103.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9103 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91 = 2.0475.

Hmm, so about 2.05. But the options are all about 2.23 or higher. So I'm getting a ratio lower than that. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the luminosity formula. Is it L = 4π R² σ T^4, or is it L = 4π R² σ T^4 multiplied by (1 + v_r/c), or something else due to Doppler shift when considering observed flux?

Wait, no, the luminosity is an intrinsic property. The observed flux would be affected by the Doppler shift because of the star's velocity. But the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor, assuming they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps the luminosity is calculated based on their own parameters (radius and temperature), not the observed flux.

So I think the earlier approach was correct: using the rest frame parameters, considering the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, which affects the inferred temperature.

Wait, but then the luminosity ratio was about 2.05, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I messed up the Doppler shift part.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but the problem is about the intrinsic luminosity. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the problem says that the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. So when the astronomers compute the luminosity, they would have to account for the Doppler shift in the observed spectrum. Because the observed flux is affected by the star's velocity.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the luminosity is calculated. Luminosity is the intrinsic power output, but the observed flux is affected by distance and Doppler shifts.

Wait, but the problem gives the radial velocities, but doesn't say anything about the distance, so perhaps we can assume both stars are at the same distance, or that the distance is not a factor in the calculation. Because without knowing the distance, you can't calculate flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed peak wavelength is the same, which would imply that the temperatures are the same when accounting for Doppler shift. Wait, that's what I thought earlier.

Wait, maybe my mistake was in the direction of the velocity. If Star_2 is moving towards us, then v_r would be negative. But the problem states radial velocities as 0 and700 km/s, but doesn't specify direction. So in reality, if Star_2 is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, so λ_obs would be less than λ_rest. If they have the same observed λ_max, that complicates things.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So Star_2's λ_obs is same as Star_1's. So perhaps Star_2's λ_rest is longer (if moving away), which would imply a lower temperature.

Wait, let me rephrase. Let's say the observed λ_max is the same for both stars.

For Star_1, since v_r1=0, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, since v_r2=700 km/s, and assuming it's moving away, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

But λ_obs1=λ_obs2 → λ_rest2 = λ_obs1 * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c)/(1 + v_r2/c) )

So for Star_2, λ_rest2 = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

Which is less than λ_obs because (1 - v/c) < (1 + v/c), so the square root is less than 1.

Wait, but according to Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T, so if λ_rest2 < λ_rest1 (which is λ_obs), that would mean T2 > T1.

So T2 = (b / λ_rest2) = (b / (λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )) )) = (b/λ_obs) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Thus, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Which is higher than T1.

Now, the luminosity ratio would be:

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4,

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1^2 / R2^2 = (2.25).

And T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So T2^4 = T1^4 * [ (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ]^2.

So T1^4 / T2^4 = [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ]^2.

Putting it all together:

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ]^2.

So, let's compute this with v = 700 km/s.

v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 0.023333.

(1 - v/c) = 0.976667,

(1 + v/c) = 1.023333.

The ratio (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.9544.

So squaring that: (0.9544)^2 ≈ 0.9113.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9113 ≈ 2.05.

But the options given are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.05 isn't an option. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Doppler effect on the flux. Because when a star is moving towards us, the observed flux increases due to the Doppler boosting. So the flux F is related to the luminosity L and distance d by F = L/(4π d²). But if the star is moving towards us, the observed flux increases by a factor of (1 + v_r/c)², I think. Or is it (1 + v_r/c) ?

Wait, the Doppler effect for flux (luminosity) is a bit different. The flux F observed is F = F0 * (1 + v_r/c), where F0 is the flux in the rest frame. Wait, no, more accurately, the flux is affected by the Doppler shift. The formula I remember is F = F0 * (1 + v_r/c), but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the flux is inversely proportional to (1 + v_r/c), depending on the direction. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the luminosity L is the intrinsic power, so the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift. But without knowing the distance, we can't compute the flux. But the problem states that the luminosities are computed based on the black body radiation. So perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, which we use to compute the temperature, and then the luminosity is based on that.

Wait, but without knowing the distance, how do we get the luminosity? Because L = 4π R² σ T^4. So if the temperature is determined via the observed wavelength (which is wavelength_max_observed), then perhaps the temperature is determined via T = b / λ_obs.

Wait, no, because λ_obs is different from λ_rest. So if the star is moving away, the observed λ is longer than the rest λ, which would imply a lower temperature than actual. But the problem says the observed λ_max is same for both stars, which would mean the same observed temperature if their rest temperatures were same. But they aren't, because their velocities are different.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used the observed wavelength to find the same temperature, but that's not correct. Let me try a different approach.

Suppose that each star's peak wavelength is λ1 and λ2 in their rest frame. Then, the observed wavelengths are λ_obs1 and λ_obs2.

But according to the problem, λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 = λ.

So,

λ = λ1 * (1 + v_r1 / c )

λ = λ2 * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So,

λ1 = λ / (1 + v_r1/c )

λ2 = λ / (1 + v_r2/c )

But since v_r1 =0, λ1 = λ.

And v_r2=700, so λ2 = λ / (1 + 700/(3e5) ) ≈ λ * (1/(1.023333)) ≈ 0.9767 λ.

But according to Wien's law, λ1 = b / T1,

λ2 = b / T2.

So,

T1 = b / λ1 = b / λ,

T2 = b / λ2 = b / (0.9767 λ) ≈ (b/λ) * (1/0.9767) ≈ T1 * 1.0233.

So T2 = T1 * 1.0233.

Now, compute the luminosity ratio.

L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4,

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= ( (1.5 R2)^2 / R2^2 ) * ( T1^4 / ( T1 * 1.0233 )^4 )

= (2.25) * ( 1 / (1.0233)^4 )

We've already calculated (1.0233)^4 ≈ 1.0966.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1 / 1.0966) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9118 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the luminosity is calculated using the observed flux, which includes the Doppler shift. So the observed flux F is F = F0 (1 + v_r / c ), where F0 is the rest frame flux. Because when a star moves towards us, the light is blueshifted and the flux increases.

But the flux F is given by F = L / (4π d^2 ), but if the star's velocity affects the flux, then F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c).

Wait, more accurately, the flux observed from a moving source is F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), assuming the source is moving towards the observer. But if it's moving away, it's F_obs = F_rest * (1 - v_r/c ), but that's an approximation for v_r << c. The exact Doppler shift for flux is F = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c )^{-1} when moving away.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me recall that the Doppler shift affects the flux. The observed flux F is related to the rest frame flux F_0 by F = F_0 * (1 + v_r / c )^{-1} when the star is moving away (v_r positive).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the flux is the energy per unit area per unit time. If the star is moving towards us, more photons per unit time arrive, so flux increases. The exact formula is F = F_0 (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is positive when moving towards us.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is F = F_0 (1 + v_r / c )^2.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me look for the correct Doppler shift effect on flux.

The Doppler effect affects the observed frequency and wavelength, but the flux (which depends on both energy and photon count) changes as well. The general formula for the observed flux F when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

F = F_0 * ( (1 + v_r / c) / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ) )

But if v_r is much smaller than c, and we can assume non-relativistic speeds, then sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ≈ 1, so F ≈ F_0 (1 + v_r/c).

But I'm not completely sure. Alternatively, when the source is moving towards you, the observed flux increases by (1 + v_r/c).

So, if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then the observed flux would be lower. But in our case, both stars have the same observed peak wavelength, so perhaps their fluxes are adjusted accordingly.

Wait, but the problem says the luminosity is computed based on black body radiation, so perhaps the flux isn't directly considered. Hmm.

I'm getting stuck here. The calculation I did earlier gives a luminosity factor of approximately 2.05, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the Doppler effect.

Another approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, so the inferred temperature is lower than the actual.

Wait, let's think again. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, implying a lower temperature. But the problem says the observed wavelengths are same. So if Star_2 is moving away, its actual temperature is higher than what we observe. But when computing luminosity, we use the actual temperature, not the observed one.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body assumption. If they used the observed wavelength to compute the temperature, then they would be incorrect, but perhaps the question assumes that the Doppler shift is accounted for correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the Doppler shift effect on the temperature, assuming that the difference in velocities is negligible, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity calculation, and the initial approach where L1/L2 is 2.25 is correct, making option A the answer. But the problem statement includes the radial velocities, which suggests that they are relevant.

But perhaps the velocities are a red herring, and the correct approach is to ignore them because the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, which implies the same temperature, leading to L1/L2 being 2.25.

But that would make option A correct. However, the problem says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, so I think they are meant to be used.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the temperature ratio.

Let me compute T2 again.

λ_rest2 = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c)/(1 + v_r2/c) )

So,

T2 = b / λ_rest2 = b / [ λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v_r2/c)/(1 + v_r2/c) ) ]

= (b / λ_obs) ) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

= T1 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

Which is correct.

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + 0.02333) / (1 - 0.02333) )

= T1 * sqrt( 1.02333 / 0.97667 )

= T1 * sqrt( approximately 1.0479 )

= T1 * 1.0236.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.0236.

So T2^4 = (T1 * 1.0236)^4 = T1^4 * (1.0236)^4.

(1.0236)^4: Let me compute that accurately.

1.0236^2 = (1 + 0.0236)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0236 + 0.0236^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0472 + 0.00055696 ≈ 1.04775696.

Then, 1.04775696^2 = ?

1.04775696 * 1.04775696.

Let me compute:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.04775696 = 0.04775696.

0.04775696 * 1 = 0.04775696.

0.04775696 * 0.04775696 ≈ 0.002281.

So adding up:

1 + 0.04775696 + 0.04775696 + 0.002281 ≈ 1.0978.

So (1.0236)^4 ≈ 1.0978.

So,

L1 = (R1^2 T1^4 ) = (2.25 R2^2 ) * T1^4.

L2 = (R2^2 T2^4 ) = R2^2 * T1^4 * (1.0978).

So,

L1/L2 = [2.25 R2^2 T1^4 ] / [ R2^2 T1^4 * 1.0978 ) ]

= 2.25 / 1.0978 ≈ 2.25 / 1.0978 ≈ 2.05.

Again, same result. So I'm getting the same answer, which isn't matching the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the observed flux is F = L / (4π d^2) * (1 + v_r / c ) when the star is moving towards us, and F = L/(4π d^2)(1 - v_r / c ) when moving away. But without knowing the distance, perhaps that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler effect because the velocities are low, but that doesn't seem to make sense given the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the luminosity is calculated using the observed flux, which accounts for the Doppler shift. So the observed flux F is F = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), where F_rest is the flux in the star's rest frame.

But without knowing the distance, I can't find the absolute luminosity, but perhaps the ratio can be found.

Wait, the observed flux F is F = L / (4π d^2) * (1 + v_r/c ).

So for Star_2, moving away, v_r is positive, so (1 + v_r/c ) is 1.02333.

But for Star_1, v_r is 0, so F1 = L1/(4π d^2).

For Star_2, F2 = L2/(4π d^2) * (1 - v_r/c ), because when moving away, the flux decreases. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, when a star moves away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted), and the flux decreases because the photons are less energetic and arrive less frequently. So the correct formula is F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the observed flux F_obs is F_rest * ( (1 + v_r/c ) / (1 - v_r/c ) )^(1/2) ), but I'm not certain.

This is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler shift because the velocities are given but the luminosity ratio is based on the radius and mass, but since mass isn't directly relevant to luminosity (it's about radius and temperature), perhaps the Doppler shift is a distractor.

In that case, L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But the problem gives radial velocities, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed wavelengths are same, so their temperatures are same. So T1 = T2.

Then, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler effect, which the problem states is part of the data.

I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should go back to the problem and see if I'm missing something.

Problem statement:

- Star_1 radius 1.5 * Star_2 radius.

- Star_1 mass 1.5 * Star_2 mass.

- Spectroscopy shows same λ_max.

- Radial velocities: Star_1 0, Star_2 700 km/s.

- Assume black body.

- Compute L1/L2.

From this, I think the correct approach is to account for the Doppler shift.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L1/L2.

Let me recompute the ratio with the correct factors.

We have L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

With R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So, T2^4 = T1^4 * ( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )^2.

So,

L1/L2 = (2.25 R2^2 * T1^4 ) / (R2^2 * T1^4 * ( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )^2 )

= 2.25 / ( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )^2.

Which is 2.25 * ( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )^2.

v/c = 0.023333.

(1 - v/c) = 0.976667.

(1 + v/c) = 1.023333.

So,

(0.976667 / 1.023333 ) ≈ 0.9544.

Square that: 0.9544^2 ≈ 0.9113.

Multiply by 2.25: 2.25 * 0.9113 ≈ 2.05.

But the options are higher, so perhaps the mistake is in the sign of velocity.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving towards us, then v_r is negative, so (1 + v/c) would be less than 1.

Wait, let's try that. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us with radial velocity 700 km/s. Then, v_r2 = -700 km/s.

So,

(1 + v/c) = 1 + (-700/3e5) = 1 - 0.023333 = 0.976667.

(1 - v/c) = 1 - (-700/3e5) = 1 + 0.023333 = 1.023333.

So,

(1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) = 1.023333 / 0.976667 ≈ 1.0479.

Square this: (1.0479)^2 ≈ 1.0978.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0978 ≈ 2.25 * 1.0978 ≈ 2.463.

Hmm, that's about 2.46, which isn't an option. The options are up to 2.35.

Wait, but this approach gives a higher ratio, but the options don't reach that. So perhaps the correct approach is that Star_2 is moving away, leading to a lower ratio of ~2.05, which isn't an option. So perhaps the answer is supposed to be option D, ~2.23.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error in the square of the ratio.

Let me compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) again.

v/c = 700/3e5 = 0.023333.

1 - v/c = 0.976667.

1 + v/c = 1.023333.

The ratio 0.976667 / 1.023333 ≈ 0.9544.

So squaring that gives 0.9544^2 = ?

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

0.0044^2 = 0.00001936.

Cross term: 2 * 0.95 * 0.0044 = 0.00836.

So,

0.9544^2 ≈ 0.9025 + 0.00836 + 0.00001936 ≈ 0.91088.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91088 ≈ 2.25 * 0.91088 ≈ 2.052.

Hmm. There's a possibility that I made a mistake in the initial assumption, perhaps the mass is given to throw us off, but the problem is about luminosity, which depends on radius and temperature, not mass. So the mass might not be relevant.

Given all this, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32.

But I'm getting 2.05, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should take a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^2)/(R2^2 T2^2), but that doesn't make sense because luminosity depends on T^4.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the Doppler shift effect, leading to L1/L2=2.25, making option A correct.

But the problem explicitly includes the radial velocities, so that's unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps the observed flux includes the Doppler shift, so the observed flux F_obs is F_rest * (1 + v_r/c), which would affect the calculation of luminosity. Because the flux is F = L/(4π d^2), and if F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c), then L = F_obs *4π d^2 (1 + v_r/c )^{-1}.

But without knowing the distance, this is tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the luminosity is calculated as L = 4π R² σ T^4, and the observed flux F is F = L/(4π d²) * (1 + v_r/c ).

But since we don't know d, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the ratio of fluxes as the same as the ratio of L * (1 + v/c ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the ratio using the formula L1 = L2 * (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But I've already computed that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed to have the luminosity ratio be (1.5^2) * (1/(1 + v/c))^4.

Wait, no, that's what I did earlier.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given that the options don't match my calculation, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I accounted for the Doppler shift. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the observed wavelength is same, so the temperatures are same, making L1/L2 = 2.25, option A. But I'm not confident.

Wait, but considering that the observed wavelength is same, but due to Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are different, which affects the luminosity. So perhaps the answer is indeed 2.05, but that's not an option, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the luminosity ratio as (1.5)^3, which is 3.375, but that's not an option either.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the Doppler shift to find the actual temperature, which increases the ratio. For example, if T2 is higher than T1, then L2 would be higher, but since R1 is larger, the factor could be around 2.23.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using more precise values.

Let me compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) accurately.

v/c = 700/3e5 = 7e2/(3e5) = 7/(300) = 0.023333...

So,

(1 - 0.02333333333) = 0.9766666667.

(1 + 0.02333333333) = 1.0233333333.

The ratio: 0.9766666667 / 1.0233333333 = let's compute this precisely.

Dividing 0.9766666667 by 1.0233333333:

Compute 0.9766666667 ÷ 1.0233333333.

I can compute this as:

1.0233333333 ≈ 1.0233333333.

0.9766666667 ÷ 1.0233333333 ≈ 0.9544.

As before.

So,

(0.9544)^2 = 0.9108.

So,

2.25 * 0.9108 ≈ 2.052.

Hmm, same result.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed wavelengths are the same, which would imply that the product R*T^3 is the same, but that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law in a different form. Wait, no, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is L = 4π R^2 σ T^4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the luminosity ratio as (R1^2 T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 ), but T2 is higher due to Doppler shift, so the ratio is less than (1.5)^2, leading to 2.05, but since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the same observed flux, but I'm not considering that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the observed flux to compute the luminosity, which would involve the Doppler factor. So F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), and F_obs = L/(4π d^2 ).

But without knowing d, perhaps the problem expects us to equate the observed fluxes.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D) ~2.23, but I'm not sure how to reach that.


To determine the ratio of the luminosities of Star_1 and Star_2, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Star_1 has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \), where \( R_2 \) is the radius of Star_2.
   - The radial velocities are \( v_{r1} = 0 \, \text{km/s} \) for Star_1 and \( v_{r2} = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) for Star_2.
   - The observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) for both stars are the same.
   - Both stars radiate as blackbodies, and luminosity is given by \( L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Doppler Shift and Temperature**:
   - The observed wavelength is related to the rest wavelength by the Doppler shift formula:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
     \]
   - Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), the rest wavelengths must satisfy:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c}}
     \]
   - Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T \)), the temperatures are related as:
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}}
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - Substituting into the luminosity formula:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(R_1^2 T_1^4)}{(R_2^2 T_2^4)}
     \]
   - Since \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \), we have \( R_1^2 / R_2^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).
   - Substituting \( T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c}} \), we get:
     \[
     T_2^4 = T_1^4 \left( \frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c} \right)^2
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot \frac{1}{\left( \frac{1 + v_{r2}/c}{1 - v_{r2}/c} \right)^2}
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - The speed of light \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), so \( v_{r2}/c = 700 / 300,000 = 0.02333 \).
   - Compute \( \frac{1 - v_{r2}/c}{1 + v_{r2}/c} \):
     \[
     \frac{1 - 0.02333}{1 + 0.02333} = \frac{0.97667}{1.02333} \approx 0.9544
     \]
   - Square this value:
     \[
     (0.9544)^2 \approx 0.9113
     \]
   - Finally:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9113 \approx 2.05
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately \( 2.05 \), but none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is \( \mathbf{D) \, \sim 2.23} \), which may account for rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

ANSWER: D
