Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars observable by two spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both. Let me read the question again.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than magnitude 17 V. Wait, brighter than 17? Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter objects. So anything with V mag <= 17 would be observable by ESPRESSO? Or wait, the question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17 (so lower than 17), then ESPRESSO can see it. Because "brighter" means more light, which is lower magnitude.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, same logic: brighter than 16, so apparent magnitude less than 16. So, to be detectable by both, a star's apparent magnitude must be <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES)? So the apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 16. So the star's apparent V must be <=16. Otherwise, it's too faint for one of the spectrographs.

Now, the options are about which stars fit this. Let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is M. To find apparent magnitude (m), use the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d=10 pc, log(10/10)=0, so m=15.5. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. That's brighter than 16, so detectable by HIRES (which needs <=16) and by ESPRESSO (which can go up to 17). So both can detect Star1.

Wait, but Star1's DEC is -75. Hmm, but the question says to disregard the pointing limits and altitude, so I don't need to worry about whether the telescopes can actually see it. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. So for HIRES, which needs <=16, 16.5 is too faint. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can, since 16.5 is less than 17. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO. So not an option for both.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5, but wait, E(B-V) is 0.6. Oh, right! Extinction affects the apparent magnitude. So the observed apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) because of dust. The formula is m = m0 + A_V, where A_V is the extinction. The problem states that the total absorption in V is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V).

So Star3's E(B-V) is 0.6, so A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86. So the observed m is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36. Oh, so the apparent magnitude is actually 17.36. Now, ESPRESSO can observe up to 17, but this is 17.36 which is fainter than 17. So ESPRESSO can't observe it. HIRES can't either, since it requires brighter than 16. So Star3 is too faint for both.

Wait, wait. No, because Star3 has an apparent V of 15.5, but after extinction, it's 17.36. So both instruments can't observe it. So Star3 is out.

Star4: Absolute V is 15.5, at 10 pc, so apparent V is 15.5. But E(B-V) is 0.4. So A_V = 3.1 * 0.4 = 1.24. So m = 15.5 +1.24=16.74. So apparent V is 16.74.

For ESPRESSO, m must be <=17. 16.74 is okay. So ESPRESSO can detect it.

For HIRES, m must be <=16. 16.74 is more than 16, so too faint. So HIRES can't. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but wait. The absolute magnitude is 15.5, same as Star1. At 10 pc, distance modulus is zero. But with extinction, the apparent magnitude increases. So Star4's m is 16.74, which is above HIRES's limit of 16. So HIRES can't see it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star5: Absolute V is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m = M + 5 log (d/10). d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)=-0.3010. So m=16.5 +5*(-0.3010) = 16.5 -1.505=14.995. So about 15.0.

Wait, but wait: M is absolute magnitude, so for a star at distance d, m = M +5 log10(d/10). So for Star5, d=5 pc: log(5/10) is log(0.5)= -0.3010. So m =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) = 16.5 -1.505=14.995. So apparent V is about 15.0.

But wait, is there any extinction? The question says Star5's data includes E(B-V)=0.4? Wait, no, looking back. Oh, Star5's description: it's the fifth star, let me check. No, the description says Star5 has absolute V of 16.5, distance 5 pc. It doesn't mention E(B-V), so I think there's no extinction. So Star5's apparent V is 15.0.

So Star5's m is 15.0. That's <=16 and <=17. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.

Wait, but let me double-check. Star5's data: RA=10h, DEC=60, M=16.5, d=5 pc. So m = M +5 log(d/10) = 16.5 +5 log(0.5). log(0.5)= -0.3010, so 5*(-0.3010)= -1.505. So 16.5-1.505=14.995, which is about 15.0.

So Star5's m is 15.0. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Now, looking back at the stars:

Star1: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=17.36 → detectable by neither.

Star4: m=16.74 → detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15.0 → detectable by both.

So which stars can both detect? Star1 and Star5.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Options are A) Star4 and Star5; B) Star3 and Star5; C) Star2 and Star3; D) Star1 and Star4.

Wait, from my analysis:

Star1 can be detected by both, Star5 can be detected by both.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5. But looking at the options, the options don't have Star1 and Star5 together. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, but Star5 by both. So A is Star4 (no) and Star5 (yes). So A is not both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 can't, Star5 can. So no.

C) Star2 and Star3 → both can't.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can (both), but Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO. So D is Star1 (good) and Star4 (only ESPRESSO), so D is not both.

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each star.

Wait, Star1: m=15.5. So m is 15.5, which is less than 16 and 17. So both can detect.

Star5: m=15.0. So both can detect.

So which option includes both Star1 and Star5? Looking at the options:

Looking back:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star5 is okay, but Star4 is only ESPRESSO.
B) Star3 and Star5 → Star3 not detected by either.
C) Star2 and Star3 → no.
D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is okay, Star4 only ESPRESSO.

So none of the options include Star1 and Star5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck each star.

Wait, Star1's apparent V is 15.5, which is less than 17 (ESPRESSO) and less than 16 (HIRES). So both can detect it.

Star5's apparent V is 15.0, which is less than both 16 and 17. So both can detect it.

So the stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have this pair.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in computing Star5's apparent magnitude.

Wait, Star5's M is 16.5, distance is 5 pc.

So m = M +5 log(d/10). d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.3010.

m = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) = 16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0.

So yes, 15.0.

So Star1 and Star5 are detectable by both.

But looking at the options, none of the options have both.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is m=16.74. HIRES can't (needs <=16). So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Star5 is detectable by both.

So option A: Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so both can't.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 can, Star4 can't.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star4. Let me recheck.

Star4: M=15.5, distance=10 pc → m=15.5. E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=3.1*0.4=1.24 → m=15.5+1.24=16.74.

So m=16.74.

HIRES needs m <16. So 16.74 is above 16 → not detectable by HIRES. So Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO. So options involving Star4 can't have both.

So the only stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5. Wait, but looking again at the options:

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is Star4 and Star5. So Star5 is good, but Star4 is not. So A is not correct.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 is good, Star4 isn't. So D is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5.

B) Star3 and Star5.

C) Star2 and Star3.

D) Star1 and Star4.

So only options, but none of the options have both Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake in which stars are detectable.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the question. The question is which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. So perhaps there are two stars which each meet both criteria, but looking at the options, perhaps the only stars are Star1 and Star5.

But in the options, the only option that includes a star detectable by both is Star5 in options A and B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check which stars are detectable by both.

Star1: detectable by both.

Star2: only ESPRESSO.

Star3: not detected by either.

Star4: only ESPRESSO.

Star5: detectable by both.

So the only stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't include both. So either I made a mistake or the options are wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question.

Wait, the question says which star can be detected by both. So perhaps only one star, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is Star1 and Star4, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the distance modulus.

Wait, distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10 (d/10 pc).

For Star1: d=10 pc. So 5 log(10/10)=0 → m=M=15.5.

So that's correct.

Star5: d=5 pc.

m = 16.5 +5 log(5/10) → 5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505 → m=15.0.

So correct.

So the two stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read the question again.

The question says, "which of the following stars can be detected with both..." So if both can detect the same star, or each can detect a different star. Wait, the question is about which stars can be detected by both. So for each star, can both spectrographs detect it. So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes both is none. But perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is, which stars can be observed by each spectrograph, but not necessarily the same star. Oh, no, the question is about which stars can be detected by both. So the same star needs to be detectable by both.

So in the options, none of the options includes both Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake, but I think the correct answer is that Star1 and Star5 can be detected by both. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the apparent magnitude of Star5. Let me check again.

Star5: M=16.5, d=5 pc.

m = M +5 log (d /10) → 16.5 +5 log(0.5)= 16.5 -1.505=14.995≈15.0. Yes.

So Star5's m is 15.0. So both can detect.

So the correct stars are Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have that combination.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5.

Star4: m=16.74 → ESPRESSO only.

So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Star3 and Star5.

Star3: m=17.36 → Neither can detect. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → both can't.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 can, Star4 can't. So D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Star5 and another star.

Wait, Star5 is detectable by both. Are there any other stars?

Star1 is detectable by both. Are there others?

Star5 is the only other.

Hmm, but the options don't include both.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star1. Let me think again.

Star1 is at DEC=-75. The observatories are at different locations.

Paranal Observatory is in the southern hemisphere (Chile). The declination of -75 would be in the southern sky. So for Paranal, declinations that low would be visible. Similarly, HIRES is at Keck Observatory in Hawaii, which is at latitude 19°N. So DEC=-75 would be very far south, perhaps not visible from Hawaii. But the problem statement says to disregard the pointing limits, so that's not a factor.

So Star1's DEC is -75, but since we're disregarding pointing limits, it's okay.

So the problem is in the options. But perhaps the correct answer is Star5, but that's alone. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking for the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate Star3 and Star4.

Wait, Star3: m=15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6 → A_V=1.86 → m=15.5+1.86=17.36.

So Star3's m=17.36. So can ESPRESSO observe it? ESPRESSO can observe up to 17. So a star with m=17.36 would be fainter than 17, so can't be observed by ESPRESSO. So Star3 is too faint for both.

Star4: m=15.5, E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24 → m=16.74. So Star4's m=16.74.

HIRES requires m <=16 → Star4 is too faint. So only ESPRESSO.

So the only stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't include this combination. So perhaps the intended answer is Star5 and Star4, but that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Star5. Let me check.

Star5's M is 16.5, distance 5 pc.

m = 16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995.

So m=15.0.

Yes, so Star5 is detectable by both.

But the options don't have Star1 and Star5 as an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, the question is about which stars can be detected by both. So perhaps the answer is Star5 alone.

But the options don't have that either.

Wait, perhaps the question is which stars can be observed by each spectrograph, regardless of the same star. Oh, no, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So same star.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: for each star, calculate apparent V and see if it's <=16 (HIRES) and <=17 (ESPRESSO). So the star must have m <=16.

So Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star2: m=16.5 → no.

Star3: m=17.36 → no.

Star4: m=16.74 → no.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So both Star1 and Star5 have m <=16. So both can be detected by both.

But the options don't have both. So perhaps the intended answer is Star5 only, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for Star1. Let me re-express.

Star1's absolute magnitude M is 15.5, at 10 pc, so m=15.5.

So for HIRES (m<=16), yes. For ESPRESSO (m<=17), yes. So both can detect Star1.

Star5's m=15.0, so both can detect.

So the correct answer is both Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question intended only to include Star5, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the apparent magnitude.

Wait, considering the question: both spectrographs can detect the same star. So the correct answer is Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should review the options again.

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D) Star1 and Star4. But Star4's m=16.74, which is above HIRES's limit. So no.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. But according to my analysis, the correct stars are Star1 and Star5, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is D) Star1 and Star4, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that only Star5 is detected by both, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance modulus. Let me check.

m = M + 5 log (d/10) → correct.

For Star1: d=10 → log(1)=0 → m=15.5.

Star5: d=5 → log(0.5)= -0.301 → m=16.5 -1.505=14.995.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Perhaps the intended answer is that Star5 is the only star detectable by both. But the options don't have an option with just Star5.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is Star3 and Star5. But Star3 is too dim for both.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A: Star4 and Star5. But Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so that's incorrect.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D: Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Wait, perhaps the question intended to say that apparent magnitude brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. So that's m <17 and m <16.

So Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

But no option includes both.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option D: Star1 and Star4.

But Star4's m=16.74 → HIRES can't detect. So this would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with Star4's data.

Wait, Star4: RA=85, DEC=-48. E(B-V)=0.4 → A_V=1.24 → m=15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Yes, correct.

So I think the only correct stars are Star1 and Star5, but the options don't include that. So perhaps the intended answer is option D, but that's incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the HIRES limit.

The question says: with HIRES, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 16 can be observed.

So m <16. Because brighter than 16.

Wait, but if a star's m is 15, it's brighter than 16, so yes.

So Star5's m=15.0: yes.

Star1's m=15.5: 15.5 is brighter than 16? No, because 15.5 is less than 16. So 15.5 is brighter than 16.

Wait, no: magnitude is a tricky scale. Lower numbers are brighter. So 15.5 is brighter than 16.

Because 15.5 is lower than 16. So 15.5 is brighter.

So Star1's m=15.5 → yes for both.

Similarly, Star5's m=15.0 → yes.

So stars detectable by both: Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't include this, which is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, but in the given options, the correct answer is option A or D. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread Star1's data.

Wait, Star1: absolute V=15.5, located at 10 pc. So m=15.5.

Yes.

So looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option D: Star1 and Star4. But Star4's m=16.74 → can't be detected by HIRES. So D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option A: Star4 and Star5. But Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the extinction for Star4 and Star5.

Wait, Star5 doesn't have any extinction mentioned. So it's m=15.0, so not affected.

So the only stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5.

But since the options don't include this, perhaps the intended answer is option D, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the apparent magnitude of Star1 and Star5.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D: Star1 and Star4. But Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So I'm stuck. But according to my analysis, the correct answer is Star1 and Star5, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which stars can be observed by either spectrograph, not both. But the question clearly says 'both'.

Alternatively, perhaps the question's links could provide more info. But I don't have access to them.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the observatory locations and whether the stars are visible. But the question says to disregard pointing limits.

So I think the correct answer is that the stars detectable by both are Star1 and Star5. But as the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A: Star4 and Star5.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I misread Star4's data. Star4's absolute V is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So m=15.5. But with extinction, m=16.74. So Star4's m is 16.74.

HIRES can only detect m <16. So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the only correct stars are Star1 and Star5.

But since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which stars can be detected by each spectrograph, but not necessarily the same star. But the question says 'which of the following stars can be detected with both', suggesting the same star.

So the only stars are Star1 and Star5.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps the intended answer is option A: Star4 and Star5.

But that's incorrect.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given this, perhaps the correct answer is option D: Star1 and Star4. But I'm not confident.

But in reality, Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So the correct answer isn't among the options.

But perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the question is about apparent magnitude brighter than, so for HIRES, m <16; ESPRESSO, m <17.

So, Star1: m=15.5 → yes to both.

Star5: m=15 → yes to both.

So I think the correct answer is both Star1 and Star5. But the options don't have this.

Thus, in the given options, perhaps the intended answer is option D: Star1 and Star4. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: Star4 and Star5.

But without further info, I'm stuck.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent magnitudes of the stars, considering the detection limits of the spectrographs. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., $m \leq 17$), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., $m \leq 16$). For a star to be detectable by both, its apparent magnitude must satisfy $m \leq 16$.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10$ pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
   - Extinction: Not mentioned, so $m = 15.5$.  
   - Detection: $m = 15.5 \leq 16$ (detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES).

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent magnitude $m = 16.5$.  
   - Detection: $m = 16.5 > 16$ (detectable only by ESPRESSO).

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent magnitude $m = 15.5$, $E(B-V) = 0.6$.  
   - Extinction: $A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86$.  
   - Observed magnitude: $m = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36$.  
   - Detection: $m = 17.36 > 17$ (not detectable by either spectrograph).

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M = 15.5$, distance $d = 10$ pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5$.  
   - Extinction: $E(B-V) = 0.4$, so $A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24$.  
   - Observed magnitude: $m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74$.  
   - Detection: $m = 16.74 > 16$ (detectable only by ESPRESSO).

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute magnitude $M = 16.5$, distance $d = 5$ pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude: $m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0$.  
   - Extinction: Not mentioned, so $m = 15.0$.  
   - Detection: $m = 15.0 \leq 16$ (detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES).

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1** ($m = 15.5$) and **Star5** ($m = 15.0$). However, none of the provided options include both stars. Among the given options, **Option D (Star1 and Star4)** is partially correct, as Star1 is detectable by both, but Star4 is not detectable by HIRES due to its $m = 16.74 > 16$. Despite this inconsistency, **Option D** is the closest match to the correct answer.

ANSWER: D
