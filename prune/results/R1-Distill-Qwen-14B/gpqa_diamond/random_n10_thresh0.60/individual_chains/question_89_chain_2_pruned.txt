Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves several reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first reaction is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the 1H NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with the deuterated solvent.

Hmm. Right, so I need to figure out what each product is. Let me break down each step.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming an adamantene derivative with a double bond. Wait, but wait. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—if it's on adjacent carbons, but wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the positions are not adjacent? Let me think. Oh wait, in adamantane, the structure is a diamond-like lattice. The 1 and 3 positions might be across each other, but wait, when you have 1,3-dibromo, perhaps it's positioned so that elimination can form a bridge or a double bond.

Wait, perhaps when KOH is used, it's a double elimination. So, two E2 reactions, each removing a Br and an H, leading to a diene? Or maybe forming a conjugated diene? Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's usually indicative of an -OH group, but wait, in NMR, if it's a broad peak, but here it's a singlet (but the question says 4.79 (2H) which could be a triplet, but the description doesn't specify
