Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how some of its properties change when dark spots cover part of its surface. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, wait. I remember that when a star has spots, it's not just about the temperature of the spots themselves but how they affect the overall radiation. So, the star's effective temperature is a sort of average based on the entire surface. The spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they would lower the overall Teff. But how exactly does that work?

The question then shifts to the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I'm trying to remember what factors influence the population of energy levels in a star's atmosphere. Oh, right, the Saha equation comes into play here. The Saha equation describes the ionization states of atoms in stellar atmospheres, but since we're dealing with neutral atoms and different energy levels, maybe it's about the Boltzmann equation instead.

Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, ΔE is the energy difference between levels, and T is the temperature. So the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases. So when the spots are present, the Teff is lower. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, but does the entire photosphere's temperature drop by 500 K? Or is the average Teff lower, but the unspotted regions are still at 6000 K, and the spots are at a lower temperature?

Hmm, the problem states that the effective temperature decreases when 40% is spotted. So the overall Teff is 5500 K. But I'm not sure if the photosphere's temperature is uniform. Oh, the photosphere is the layer from which the star emits most of its light, right. So perhaps the average of the Teff across the surface is lower when spots are present.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So the photosphere is at a lower temperature when spots are present. So the temperature we should be using in the Boltzmann equation is the effective temperature of the photosphere as a whole, which is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when they're not.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So that's the T we should use in the calculation.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n1 and n2) is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me think: the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 -
