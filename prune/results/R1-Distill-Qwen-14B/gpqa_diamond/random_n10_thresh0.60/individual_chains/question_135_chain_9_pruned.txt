Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, no, that's probably a typo. I think the correct interaction term would be something like L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Oh, wait, the user wrote it as -λ f ψ_f bar ψ_f (ῡ + X). Hmm, maybe it's supposed to be a Yukawa interaction term where the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So probably the interaction is L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find out which fermions it can decay into, considering their masses.

So the decay would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion. But for this to be kinematically allowed, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of the parent must be greater than or equal to the sum of the masses of the daughters. But wait, in reality, it's the rest mass. So, for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of X must be ≥ 2*m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion.

So what fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV? Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Let me list the masses of the known fermions:

Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
Mu (μ): ~0.105 GeV
Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
Down quark
