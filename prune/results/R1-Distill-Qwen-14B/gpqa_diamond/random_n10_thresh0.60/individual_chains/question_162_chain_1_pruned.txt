Okay, so I've got this metric given in the problem, and I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2-dimensional metric because I see dx and dy. So this is probably a 2D space, right? But the question mentions a pseudosphere, which makes me think it's a hyperbolic surface, maybe like a negative curvature space. Pseudosphere is a term I've heard before, associated with hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the area. Oh, right, in differential geometry, the area of a surface can be found using the metric. The area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So I need to compute the determinant of the metric and then integrate over the area, but wait, the problem is giving a metric that depends on x and y, so maybe I can find the area that way.

Let me write the metric in matrix form. The given metric is diagonal, so the matrix g would be:

g_11 = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_22 = 32/(4 - x² - y²)
g_12 = g_21 = 0

So the determinant of g (which is a 2x2 matrix here) is the product of the diagonal elements since it's diagonal. So det(g) = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

So sqrt(det(g)) would be 32 / (4 - x² - y²). Because sqrt( (32^2) ) is 32, and the denominator squared becomes (4 - x² - y²)^1. So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait, the metric given is in 2D, so the area would be the integral of dA over the region where the metric is defined. So I need to figure out the region of integration. The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So for the metric to be real, the denominator must be positive. Because if it's negative, the metric would have imaginary components, which doesn't make sense physically.

So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin in the x-y plane. Because the radius of the circle is 2, as x² + y² =4 is the boundary.

So the area integral would be the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, how to compute this integral. Maybe switch to polar coordinates, since the region is a circle. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The integral becomes:

Integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 (since x²+y²<4 → r <2).

Integral [θ:0 to 2π] ∫[r:0 to 2] [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

I can separate the integrals since the integrand doesn't depend on θ. So:

( ∫0^2π dθ ) * ( ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr )

The first integral is 2π.

The second integral: Let me compute ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4 =0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32/(u)] * (-du/2).

The integral is 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

Which is 32*(1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4. Because switching the limits removes the negative sign.

So it's 16 ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4 → 16 [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral becomes 16 (ln4 - ln0) → 16 (ln4 - (-infinity)) → 16 * infinity → infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the area is infinite, that's one of the options. The options are A)0, B)4π(x²+y²), C)4π(x²−y²), D) +infty.

Wait, but the integral I computed is 2π multiplied by 16 * [ln4 - (-infty)] → which would be infinite.

Wait, but what's the problem statement again? The metric is given as ds²=32/(4−x²−y²) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator becomes zero when r=2 (since x²+y²=4), which is the boundary of the region. So the area is the integral over x²+y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but when I did the substitution, the integral from 0 to 2 of r/(4-r²) dr, I got an integral that diverges. So the area is infinite.

Wait, but is that possible? I mean, the metric given is similar to that of a hyperbolic plane, which indeed has infinite area. Or perhaps
