Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on my adamantane structures, but I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage-like molecule, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane skeleton.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with dibromides, especially vicinal dihalides (like 1,2), it usually leads to elimination, forming alkenes via an E2 mechanism. But wait, in this case, the dihalide is on 1 and 3, not adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but with the dihalides not being on the same carbon. Oh, wait, maybe it's a neighboring group elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: when dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes they undergo a double elimination, especially if they're on adjacent carbons. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent; the carbons are separated by one carbon in between. Oh, wait, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait,
