Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. When the astronomers did spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They're assuming the stars radiate as black bodies and want to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. So, what do I remember about luminosity and blackbody radiation? I think the luminosity of a star relates to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Because they're assuming blackbody radiation, that should apply here.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that for blackbody radiation, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So, if λ_max is the same, then T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. The problem says they found the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, right, because each star emits a spectrum, and the peak wavelength is where they emit most intensely. So according to Wien's Law, same λ_max implies same T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but the radial velocities are given. Oh, right! Because stars can have Doppler shifts. The observed wavelengths would be shifted due to their velocities. Wait, but the problem says they determined the wavelengths at which they appeared brightest. So if the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths are shifted.

Wait a second, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no shift. Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s. So for Star_2, the observed wavelength would be longer (if moving away) or shorter (if moving towards) than the emitted wavelength.

But in this case, the problem states that the observed wavelengths where
