Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these experiments won't help determine the mitochondrial role of the new anti-diabetes drug. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question says that a eukaryotic cell uses mitochondria to turn macromolecular building blocks into energy, right? That process involves redox reactions, and the energy is stored in the phosphate bonds, particularly in ATP. The drug's effect on mitochondria is what we're looking for. So the experiments should assess mitochondrial function or their state.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Differential centrifugation to extract mitochondria and then using a glucose uptake assay. Wait, differential centrifugation is a method to isolate mitochondria because they're denser than the cytoplasm. If the drug affects mitochondrial function, like their ability to take in glucose (but wait, don't mitochondria primarily use other fuels like fatty acids or amino acids? Oh wait, some cells like yeast might use glucose, but HEK cells are mammalian. Anyway, the assay here is for glucose uptake. If the mitochondria can't function properly, maybe their glucose uptake would change. So this could help determine if the mitochondria are affected. So this option might be useful, so probably not the correct answer.

Option B: Transformation with luciferase and adding luciferin. Hmm, luciferase is an enzyme that uses luciferin to produce light. If the cells are transformed with recombinant luciferase, maybe it's in the mitochondria? Wait, but in this case, the setup is that after adding luciferin, they measure light. I'm not sure. Wait, luciferase is
