Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, I think Lorentz symmetry is definitely one of the big ones. Because SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory. All the operators should transform properly under Lorentz transformations, right? So Lorentz symmetry is a must.

Poincare symmetry is about the combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations. So it includes things like momentum conservation and energy-momentum relation. Wait, wait. Poincare symmetry is more about the invariance under translations and Lorentz transformations. But I'm a bit confused. Do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because the standard model does, and SMEFT is an effective theory that includes the SM, so yes, I think they do. Or wait, maybe Poincare is automatically included if the theory is Lorentz invariant. Because Poincare includes both translations and Lorentz. But wait, I remember that some effective theories might have operators that respect Lorentz but not Poincare? Or not. Maybe in SMEFT, all operators are Poincare-invariant because they're part of a Lorentz-invariant theory in a Minkowski spacetime. So yes, Poincare symmetry
