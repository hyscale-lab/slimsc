Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

So, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are also some hints provided, which I should definitely use.

First, let's outline the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options for E are all cyclic ketones, so E is likely a ketone. Let's think about each step.

Starting with step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN is a nucleophile and typically reacts with carbonyl groups. So, if A has a carbonyl (like a ketone), adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin (B). Cyanohydrins are addition products where the H from HCN adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN- adds to the oxygen, forming an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent to each other.

So, A is probably a cyclic ketone. The IR of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is typical for a ketone's C=O stretch.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. H2 and Pd usually cause hydrogenation, which would reduce double bonds. Wait, but B is a cyanohydrin, which doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Wait, perhaps B has a nitrile group. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin is an alcohol and a nitrile adjacent? Wait, no, I think the cyanohydrin is when a carbonyl becomes an alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So, structure would be R-C(OH)-CN. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin has the structure R2C(OH)CNR2? Wait, no, I think it's a geminal diol when the carbonyl is from a ketone. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The mechanism
