Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad—could that be from an -OH group? Or maybe an amine? No, probably not an amine because those usually show up around 3300 or so and might be less broad. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, but maybe conjugated, or perhaps an aromatic ring with some substitution. Wait, or maybe it's an absorption from something else, like an amide or conjugated double bonds.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, probably an alkene. That means there's some unsaturation in the molecule.

Now, the mass spectrum. There's a fragment peak at m/z=45. Let me think about possible fragments. The molecular ion or a fragment with a mass of 45. 45 could correspond to a variety of things. For example, (CH3)2O is 45 (but that's diethyl ether, but I think I'm getting ahead of myself). Alternatively, maybe a ketone group or an ester. Wait, another possibility is that it's a COO- group losing something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment that includes a carbonyl group. Let me think about possible fragments. Another common fragment is the CH2=CH- group, but that's more like 28. Hmm, wait, 45 could be from a larger group. Let me calculate what 4
