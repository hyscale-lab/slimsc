Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Its mass is also 1.5 times larger, but I'm not sure if mass matters here. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. And their radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. But wait, how does that affect luminosity?

The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A to D, each a number around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. So I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says they radiate as black bodies. So I should use the blackbody radiation laws.

Also, the peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. Since the problem states that the wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T is same.

So if T is same for both, then L is proportional to R squared. Because L = 4πR²σT⁴, and T is same.

But wait, wait. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1's velocity is 0, and Star_2's is 700 km/s. How does that affect anything? Oh, right, the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, its observed wavelength shifts. But in this case, the peak wavelength is the same as measured. So does that mean that any Doppler shift has already been accounted for?

Wait, the problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest were the same. So they must have measured the same λ_max for both, but accounting for their velocities. So maybe the actual emission wavelengths are different, but after correcting for Doppler shift, they appear the same?

Hmm
