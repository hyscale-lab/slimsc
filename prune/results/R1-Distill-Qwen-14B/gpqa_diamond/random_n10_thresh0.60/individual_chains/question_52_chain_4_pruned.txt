Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, alright, let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The key here is to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. 

Alright, let's get into the details. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are making the star cooler overall.

Now, the main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, the ratio without spots is higher than when there are spots. We need to find how much the ratio changes—like, what's the factor by which it changes.

I remember that under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of populations in two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Wait, wavelength is related to energy via E = hc/λ. So, the energy difference between the two levels is E = hc/(lambda). Let me compute that. But wait, for the ratio, I might not need the exact energy because it'll cancel out in a way.

But wait, the ratio is n1/n2? Or is it the other way around? The problem mentions the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1 and level 2. So, it's n1/n2. And the observation is that this ratio decreases when spots are present. So, without spots, n1/n2 is higher than when spots are present.

Let me think about this. When the temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio n1/n2? The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). So, if E2 > E1, then E2-E1 is positive. So, exp( - delta E / (kT) ) is a term that decreases as T decreases because delta E/(kT) increases, making the exponent more negative, and the exponential smaller. So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - delta E/(kT) ). 

Wait, but if T decreases, the exponential gets smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. So n1/n2 would increase because n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1). Wait, wait. Let me see. If n2/n1 = A * exp( -x/(kT) ), then when T decreases, exp term decreases, so n2/n1 decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would increase when T decreases. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that's the opposite. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, wait. Maybe I got the levels mixed up. Let me re-express. Let me define level 1 as the lower energy level and level 2 as the higher. So, E2 > E1. Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

When the star has spots, T is lower. So, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio n2/n1 smaller. So, n2/n1 decreases when T decreases. Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would increase. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, that's a contradiction. So maybe I have the levels reversed?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is being used in the opposite direction. Let me think again. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Since wavelength is inversely proportional to energy, a longer wavelength (like 1448 Å) would correspond to lower energy. So, the energy difference between the two levels is lower than that of, say, shorter wavelengths. 

But that might not directly affect the ratio calculation. Let me think about what the ratio depends on. The ratio is n1/n2, which under LTE is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, that would be if the ratio is n2/n1. No, wait. Let's get this right. The Boltzmann equation says:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, n1/n2 = 1 / [ (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ] 

Which is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is positive. So, when T increases, the exponent (positive) increases, making exp( ... ) larger. So n1/n2 increases with temperature. 

Wait, so when the star has spots, the overall T drops. So T decreases—so n1/n2 decreases. That aligns with the problem statement: the ratio decreases when spots are present. So yes, without spots, the ratio is higher.

So, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So, without spots: T1 =6000 K; with spots: T2=5500 K. We need to find (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Wait, no. The problem says when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots. Because when spots are present, the ratio is lower, so the factor would be a number greater than 1.

Alternatively, the question says, the ratio decreases when spots are present. So, the factor is the ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots. So yes, factor = [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_spots.

So to compute this factor, let's write the ratio for both cases.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But E2 - E1 = hc/(lambda). Let's compute that.

Wait, but in the ratio, the (E2-E1) will be the same because the transition wavelength is fixed. So, the ratio of the two ratios (without and with spots) will be:

Factor = [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) ) ]

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out. So,

Factor = exp( (E2 - E1
