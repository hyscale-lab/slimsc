Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the decay of a boson field X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian equation, and some options for possible decay channels. I need to figure out which decay modes are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian they provided is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh wait, I think I should parse this correctly. Maybe it's something like L_int = -λ ψ† (v + X) ψ, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh, perhaps the field ψ is a fermion, and X is the boson field. So, the interaction term is between the fermion ψ and the boson X.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find which particles it can decay into. Kinematic allowance means the energy of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the boson, right? So, for a decay X → f f-bar, the sum of the rest masses of f and f-bar must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Each decay product is a fermion-antifermion pair. So for each fermion f
