Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are various powers of r: r cubed, r fifth, etc.

Hmm, wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So, plx is inversely proportional to d.

In this case, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down:

N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. So plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So substituting, 1/(plx)^5 becomes (d)^5. Because (1/plx) is d, so (1/plx)^5 is d^5.

Wait, no wait. Let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/(plx)^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So (plx) = 1/d → plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

So the number of stars N goes as d^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?". So it's about the number of stars as a function of distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases as d^5.

But wait, wait, this is in a specific region of the sky. So perhaps the volume comes into play here. Because the number of stars depends on the volume,
