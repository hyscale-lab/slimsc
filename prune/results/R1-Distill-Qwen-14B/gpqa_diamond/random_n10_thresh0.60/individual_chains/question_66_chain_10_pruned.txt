Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT for short. The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four, and the choices are combinations of them. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it's built from higher-dimensional operators that are constructed respecting certain symmetries.

Wait, the options are 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me list them again. 1 is Lorentz Symmetry, 2 is Poincare symmetry, 3 is CP symmetry, and 4 is CPT symmetry. The question asks which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

I think about what symmetries are part of the Standard Model. The SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so SMEFT as an extension should also respect Lorentz symmetry because it's based on the SM. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it must respect Poincare as well. So 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but wait a second. Are Poincare symmetry and Lorentz symmetry the same thing? No. Lorentz symmetry deals with local transformations, while Poincare includes translations as well. So, in a field theory, you have Poincare symmetry, which is the combination of Lorentz and translations. So if the theory is a Poincare-invariant field theory, that would imply it respects both Lorentz and translations. So in SMEFT, the operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Then, what about CP and CPT? I remember that the SM has CPT symmetry, but does that apply to SMEFT? I think SMEFT doesn't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. For example, if you have higher-dimensional operators that violate CP, they might be allowed in the SMEFT framework. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, but I think they must respect CPT symmetry.

Wait, wait. Because in the SM, the CPT theorem states that CPT symmetry must hold. So any effective theory that's a valid extension of the SM must also respect CPT symmetry. Because if you violate CPT, the theory might not make sense, like it could lead to non-unitary S-matrix or other inconsistencies. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT (4), but CP (3) might not be required.

Wait, but wait again. Some sources say that in SMEFT, operators are required to be CPT symmetric.
