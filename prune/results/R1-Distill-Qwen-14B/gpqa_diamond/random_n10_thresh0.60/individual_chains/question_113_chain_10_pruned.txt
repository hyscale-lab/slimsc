Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem gives me information from three different techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let's start by analyzing each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR spectrum. I remember that FTIR is great for identifying functional groups based on specific absorption peaks. The question says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, could it be something else? Maybe an N-H stretch? But the options don't include nitrogen, so probably O-H.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 could be conjugated carbonyl groups, maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl or an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. Or perhaps an amide, but again, no N in options. Another thought: if it's an ester, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1750. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone system.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound likely has an alkene group. That's good to know. So maybe we're looking at something with both carbonyl and double bonds.

Now, the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Let's think about what fragments give 45. Common fragments include the methyl group (15), but that's too low. Maybe something with more atoms. Oh, the CH3O group? No, that's 31. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a ketene ion (like (CH3)2CO+ giving 58?), no. Alternatively, a CH2=CH-O group? Hmm, not sure. Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion
