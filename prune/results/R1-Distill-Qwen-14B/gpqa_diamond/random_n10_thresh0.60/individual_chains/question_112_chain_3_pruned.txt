Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about an electron state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So the first thing I think is, I need to normalize this state because it's only proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, to normalize, I remember that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should be 1. Let me compute that. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). So their absolute squares are |1+i|² and |2-i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: 1² + 1² = 2. And |2-i|² is 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator whose matrix representation is Aij. The rules for Aij are Aij = hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix because it's spin-1/2, so two states. Let me write it out.

The matrix A would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[hbar/2  0   ]

Because for i≠j, which are the off-diagonal elements, they are hbar/2. The diagonal elements are 0.

Wait a minute, what operator has this matrix? Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the X (bit flip) operator. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, but the question is about measuring in the eigenbasis of A,
