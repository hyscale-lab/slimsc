Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

Hmm, let me start by breaking down the target molecule. So, it has a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to another cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Also, there's a carbonyl group (the carbaldehyde part). So the structure is something like cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent on the cyclohexane ring.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a triple bond) attached. So, I think the first step is to figure out how to convert this triple bond into the necessary substituents.

Looking at the target, I see that there's a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, maybe I should think about the steps required to introduce that.

So, the ethynyl group is a good leaving group or can be functionalized. One common reaction with terminal alkynes is the deprotonation under strong base to form an acetylide. Maybe NaNH2 is used here as a base. So, the first reagent in all options is NaNH2 except maybe some. Oh wait, looking at the options, all options have NaNH2 as the first step except maybe none? Let me check.

Wait, no, option D uses NaNH2 and methanol. Hmm.

So, if I deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, I would form the acetylide. Then, what's next? The acetylide could undergo alkylation. Oh, looking at the options, after NaNH2, some have methyl chloride, others ethyl chloride, or methanol.

Wait, so after forming the acetylide, an alkylation would add a methyl group. So if I use methyl chloride, the acetylide would attack, adding a methyl group to the triple bond. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is CH2-C≡C-R? No, wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. When you deprotonate that, you get a cyclohexyl acetylide: cyclohexyl-C≡C^(-) Na^+.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So that's a propyl group attached to the cyclohexane? Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation is adding a methyl group to the triple bond, which would give a longer chain. Then, perhaps hydrogenation comes into play.

Looking at the target, there's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2 that's also attached to an OH and a carbonyl. So maybe the triple bond is converted into a CH2 group with substituents.

Wait, maybe after forming the acetylide, I alkylate it, then hydrogenate the triple bond. Let me think.

If I have ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-ethylide), after deprotonation and alkylation with methyl chloride, I get an ethyl group addition, turning the triple bond into a single bond. Wait, no, the alkylation would add a methyl group to the acetylide.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think step by step.

1. Starting with ethynylcyclohexane: structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. Wait no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, ethynyl is CH2-C≡CH? Or is it CH2-C≡C-? No, ethynyl group is -C≡CH, right? So the molecule is cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

When I deprotonate with NaNH2, I get cyclohexyl-C≡C^- Na^+.

Then, if I add methyl chloride (CH3Cl), the acetylide would attack, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. That's 1-propynylcyclohexane? Hmm.

But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH and a CH2-Carbonyl. So maybe I need to add a hydroxyl group there.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, hydrogenation is done. Let's see, the second step in option C is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. So that would hydrogenate the triple bond.

Wait, if I have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 after alkylation, and then hydrogenate it with H2 and Pd, the triple bond becomes a single bond. So it would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that's a straight chain. Not matching the target.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me think again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group attached. Then, on carbon 1 (adjacent to CHO?), there's a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl.

Wait, perhaps the cyclohexane ring is the main ring, and the substituent is a CH2 group connected to OH and another cyclohexyl group.

So, the structure would be something like cyclohexane with a -CH2-OH and a -CH2-Cyclohexane, along with a CHO group on the same carbon.

Wait, maybe I need to form a geminal diol and then an epoxide or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Let me think about that.

Another approach is to look for the functional groups. The target has a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group in the same molecule. How to get that from ethynylcyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond can be oxidized. But under what conditions?

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is first converted into a ketone. But I don't see how.

Wait, I think I need to look at the possible reagent sequences in the options and work backwards.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride, H2/Pd, Ba(OH)2, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, that seems a lot, but maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Wait, step 3 is ozonolysis, which would cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups.

So, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, we get a diene, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, but let me reconstruct all steps.

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride.

Assuming that's deprotonation and alkylation, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a C≡CH. Deprotonate to get acetylide, then methyl chloride adds a methyl group, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is hydrogenation. So the triple bond becomes single bond, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? That would give a straight chain, maybe.

Then step 3 is O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of a diene would break it into two carbonyl groups. But if the molecule after step 2 is a straight chain, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two aldehydes. But I don't see a diene here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first step.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1 and 2, the molecule is a cyclohexane with a substituent that has a double bond. Because if the triple bond is hydrogenated under H2 and Pd, it becomes a single bond. Hmm, but that doesn't create a double bond.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. Oh wait, what's the reagent? H2 with Pd—maybe that's for hydrogenation. Wait, Pd is usually used for hydrogenation of triple bonds to single bonds, not cis/trans addition. So after H2 and Pd, the triple becomes single. So cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but then ozonolysis would need a double bond. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong options. Let me look at option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/(CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Wait, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol is a methylating agent. So perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol to form an ethyl group? Wait, no, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. So maybe the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^-) reacts with methanol to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3? That doesn't seem right. Or perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is deprotonation with NaNH2, then the acetylide is treated with methyl iodide or something else. Oh, in option D, step 1 is with methanol, which is a methyl group source. So, perhaps the acetylide attacks methyl iodide, but wait, I don't see methyl iodide in the options. Hmm.

Wait, the first step in D is NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is for deprotonation and alkylation. Methanol has a methyl group, but it's a poor methylating agent for acetylides. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is quenched with methanol, giving cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3? No, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think of the target again. The target has a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group and a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to another cyclohexane and a hydroxyl group.

So, perhaps the starting ethynylcyclohexane needs to be converted into a di-substituted cyclohexane with the correct substituents.

Another approach: perhaps the acetylide is used to form a cyclohexylmethyl group. Then, further functionalization.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a cyclohexylmethyl group with a substituent.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is first converted into a ketone. How? By oxymercuration or other methods. But I don't see any reagents for that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, then subjected to dihydroxylation or some addition.

Wait, but in the options, I see H2 and Pd being used in some steps, which is hydrogenation.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2-OH and a CH2-Cyclohexane group, along with a formyl group.

So, perhaps the starting ethynylcyclohexane is first converted to a cyclohexylmethyl group with a triple bond, then functionalized.

Wait, maybe I should think about adding a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond, then hydrogenating it to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

Ethynylcyclohexane → form acetylide → alkylation → hydrogenation to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but how? Let's see.

If I have cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 (from alkylation with methyl chloride), then maybe hydrogenating under different conditions. Wait, if I hydrogenate the triple bond under specific conditions, could it add hydrogen in a way to form a carbonyl?

Wait, I remember that sometimes catalytic hydrogenation can lead to different products. For example, hydrogenation of an alkyne with Lindlar's catalyst (H2, Pd with quinoline) gives cis addition, but I'm not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl via oxidation.

Wait, but in the options, I don't see any strong oxidizing agents after the initial steps except for H2SO4 and HgSO4 in option A, which is a Jones oxidation, used to oxidize alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids.

Wait, maybe the steps involve forming an epoxide, then opening it with something.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone via some method, but I'm not sure.

Let me look for another approach. The target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So perhaps the starting material needs to be converted into a benzaldehyde-like structure via oxidation.

But ethynylcyclohexane isn't directly oxidizable to a carbonyl. Wait, but if I could form a diol from the triple bond, maybe I can oxidize that diol into a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe the triple bond is converted into a cis-diol via hydration, then oxidized to a carbonyl. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into an alkene via hydrogenation, then subjected to dihydroxylation, then cleaved.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option C: Steps 1-4 are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

So step 1: acetylide formation and alkylation with methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces the triple bond. So this becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but then step 3 is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis works on alkenes, cleaving them into carbonyl groups. But the molecule after step 2 is a straight chain with a single bond between the CH2 groups, so no double bond. So ozonolysis wouldn't do anything, unless I'm missing something.

Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm not thinking correctly.

Wait, perhaps after alkylation, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, making an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that.

But with H2 and Pd, the triple bond would become a single bond, not a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps using a different hydrogenation condition could give a cis or trans double bond. Wait, but H2 and Pd is typically for full hydrogenation to a single bond.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Looking back, the target has a cyclohexane ring, a formyl group, and a substituent with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a substituent to the ring and then oxidizing it.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which would then be oxidized to a carboxylic acid, but I don't see that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is used in a coupling reaction, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to build a diol first, then epoxidize and open it.

Wait, but let me think about the steps again.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to both a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane ring. So, this substituent is a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed by some kind of alkyne addition followed by oxidation.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is first converted into a geminal diol via hydration, then oxidized to a carbonyl. But how?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a carbonyl group. For example, using a mercury-based oxidation like the Eglinton reaction, which converts terminal alkynes into ketones, but I'm not sure about the exact conditions. Alternatively, ozonolysis of a triple bond? No, I think ozonolysis is for alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexylidene methanol, which would be a cyclohexyl group attached to a CHOH group. Then, oxidation could form a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure about the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is used to form a benzil-like structure, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, perhaps I should look into the possible reagents and see which option makes sense.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq. NH3; O3, H2O; NH4OH.

So step 1: acetylide formation and alkylation with ethyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3 is a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation or elimination. Maybe this forms an alkyne with a longer chain, but I'm not sure.

Step 3: O3/H2O → cleaves the alkyne? Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes. So that doesn't make sense unless the alkyne is converted into an alkene. Maybe step 2 does that.

Wait, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a condition for elimination reactions. So perhaps the alkyne becomes an alkene via dehydrohalogenation or elimination. Wait, but where's the halogen?

Hmm, in step 1, we've added ethyl chloride to the acetylide. So the product is an alkyne with an ethyl group. If in step 2, we do elimination, perhaps it forms an alkene.

Wait, let's think: After step 1, structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

In step 2, with Li/NH3, perhaps the triple bond is deprotonated and an elimination occurs, but I don't see a leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination to form an alkene. Wait, but how? Unless there's a leaving group adjacent to the triple bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethyl group is removed. I'm not sure.

Another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which suggests that a formyl group is attached to the cyclohexane. So maybe the original triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. How?

I remember that the oxidation of terminal alkynes can give carboxylic acids under strong acidic conditions, perhaps with HgSO4 and H2SO4. So, if I treat ethynylcyclohexane with H2SO4 and HgSO4, it might oxidize the triple bond to a COOH group.

Wait, looking at the options, option A has H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O as the fourth step. So perhaps step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Hmm.

Wait, but let me think. If I oxidize ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH) with H2SO4 and HgSO4, I would get cyclohexyl-COOH. Then, in the presence of Ba(OH)2, perhaps it undergoes something else. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation, but that's usually done with peracids.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.

Wait, another thought: The target molecule has both a hydroxyl and a formyl group. Maybe the hydroxyl is introduced via epoxide ring opening, and the formyl comes from oxidation.

But how to get there.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is: deprotonate to form acetylide, alkylate to add a methyl group, hydrogenate the triple bond to form a CH2 group, then perform ozonolysis to create a carbonyl group.

But then, how would ozonolysis work on a single bond? It wouldn't. So maybe after hydrogenation, there's a double bond.

Ah, wait! Wait, perhaps the triple bond is first reduced to a cis or trans double bond, then ozonolysis is used to cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But how to reduce the triple bond to a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about each option's reagents.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

So, after step 1: acetylide + methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces the triple bond to single bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can induce elimination, perhaps forming an epoxide but I'm not sure.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or acids, but more so in the Birch reduction or other elimination reactions.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the formation of epoxides, but I'm not certain.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation. So, in step 4, the molecule is treated with a strong oxidizing agent. But after step 2, the structure is a straight chain with three CH2 groups. Oxidation would likely break it down, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd; O3/(CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Step 1: acetylide + methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Ozonolysis requires a double bond. But the molecule after step 2 has a single bond. So, ozonolysis won't act on it. So perhaps that's not the right option.

Wait, unless step 2 doesn't fully hydrogenate the triple bond but leaves a double bond. How?

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong catalyst. If the hydrogenation is done with a Lindlar catalyst, it would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. But the options don't specify the catalyst. The options just say H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which I think is for full hydrogenation.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Let me think about the target structure again. The cyclohexane ring has a formyl group. So perhaps the formyl comes from the oxidation of a CH2 group. Then, the substituent with the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group comes from another part.

Another approach: Let's think about the substituent on the cyclohexane. The substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane. So, perhaps this substituent arises from a Grignard reaction or some similar addition.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a hydroxyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a conjugate addition. Wait, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct path is to add a methyl group via alkylation, then hydrogenate to form a CH2 group, then perform a dihydroxylation, then oxidation or something else.

Wait, but that's getting too vague. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq. NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol, introducing a methyl group.

Wait, methanol is a poor methylating agent, but in presence of a strong base, perhaps it can act as a methyl source. So, the acetylide (cyclohexyl-C≡C^-) could react with methanol to form cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3. Hmm, not sure if that's correct.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination. If the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3, perhaps elimination would form a triple bond again, but that doesn't help.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the NaNH2 and methanol could be for deprotonation and alkylation with methanol as the methyl source. So, the product would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

Then step 2: Li in NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination, but without a good leaving group, I'm not sure.

Step 3: Ozonolysis. Again, but without a double bond, it won't do much.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should think of all the steps in each option and see which makes sense.

Option B: Steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq. NH3; O3, H2O; NH4OH.

So step 1: acetylide + ethyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Step 2: Li/NH3. This might induce elimination. If the structure is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3, perhaps elimination would form a triple bond again, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it converts the triple bond into an alkene via dehydrohalogenation, but where's the halogen? I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the ethyl group is added to the acetylide, giving a longer alkyne. Then, in step 2, elimination forms an alkene.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis of the alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls. Then, step 4: NH4OH would work as a mild reducing agent, perhaps for something else.

But I'm not sure how this leads to the target molecule.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which leads to the target.

The target has a formyl group (CHO), a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2, and a cyclohexyl group attached to that CH2. So, perhaps the formyl is from oxidation of a CH2 group, and the CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane groups come from somewhere else.

Wait, another approach: The ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to form a propargyl group. Then, hydrogenated to form a CH2-CH2 group, which upon ozonolysis wouldn't work because no double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation and hydrogenation, an oxidation occurs. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the correct sequence first forms a diol, then oxidizes it to a carbonyl. So, the triple bond is first converted into a diol, then oxidized.

But how to convert the triple bond into a diol? Using Hg(OAc)2 in presence of water? Or some other hydration method.

Wait, I think the hydration of an alkyne can give a cis-diol. If the triple bond is in a ring, like ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps hydration would give a cyclohexane with a vicinal diol (cis-1,2-diol).

Then, oxidation of the diol would give a ketone. But wait, oxidation of a vicinal diol (like in cyclohexane) would lead to a diketone? Or perhaps a lactone? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps that's not the way, but let's think about the reagents.

Option A's reagents include Ba(OH)2 and then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe in a ring-opening reaction. Wait, if I have a diol, Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, forming a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the oxidation of alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate to form acetylide, then alkylation to add a methyl group → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis → but no double bond, so nothing happens.

This doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is not hydrogenated all the way, but reduced to a double bond, then ozonolysis.

But how to do that with H2 and Pd? I think H2 and Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, not leaving a double bond.

Wait, maybe using a different catalyst could give a cis or trans double bond. For example, using Lindlar's catalyst with H2 would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. But the options don't specify the catalyst, just H2/Pd.

So, perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl via oxidation. For example, using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O (like Jones oxidation) would oxidize the triple bond to a COOH group.

So, if step 4 in option A is such an oxidation, then after steps 1-3, we have a structure that can be oxidized.

Wait, let's go through option A step by step:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: acetylide + methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd: reduces triple bond to single bond → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination to form an alkene? Or maybe Ba(OH)2 is for epoxidation, but I'm not sure.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: Jones oxidation. So, after step 3, perhaps we have an alcohol which gets oxidized.

Wait, but after step 2, the structure is straight chain with three CH2 groups. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, maybe step 3 is dehydrogenation or elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 treated with Ba(OH)2? Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination to form an alkene. So, if the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3, and we eliminate a water molecule, perhaps we form cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 induces dehydrogenation to form a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, that would require losing H2O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation. Maybe it oxidizes the CH2 group to a ketone. But Ba(OH)2 isn't typically an oxidizing agent; it's more of a base and can induce elimination.

After step 3, perhaps the structure is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH. Then, step 4 would oxidize the alcohol to a ketone.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the correct answer based on the options.

The target molecule has a formyl group, which suggests that one of the steps should involve the oxidation of a CH2 group to CHO.

Looking at option C, the steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → reduces to cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so won't react.

So, perhaps this is not the correct path.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps forms cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li, NH3 → maybe elimination to form triple bond again or add another group.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond.

Hmm.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li, NH3 → elimination, maybe forms a triple bond.

3. O3/H2O → but no double bond.

4. NH4OH → maybe work up or something.

Not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is in option C. Let me think.

After step 2 in option C, the product is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's a straight chain, not a ring. The target has a cyclohexane with substituents.

Wait, no, the target is a cyclohexane with substituents, so perhaps the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a ring with a triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps involve forming a bicyclic structure or adding substituents to the ring.

Another idea: Maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule is treated with ozone to cleave a double bond, creating a carbonyl group. But without a double bond, this won't happen.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, the triple bond is partially hydrogenated to a cis double bond.

Wait, but H2 and Pd usually hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reagent sequence is:

1. Deprotonate and alkylate to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond (using a specific catalyst).

3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

4. Work up to form the desired groups.

But the options don't specify the catalyst for hydrogenation; they just say H2/Pd.

So, if the hydrogenation under H2/Pd is done with a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar's), the triple bond would become a cis double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, but the options don't specify the catalyst. So, perhaps the correct option is C, which uses H2/Pd, but perhaps the catalyst is such to produce a double bond. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me try to see how option C could produce the target.

Option C steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd → reduces triple bond to single bond → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing happens. So, this would not work.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that the hydrogenation in step 2 of option C is done with a poisoned catalyst, leading to a cis double bond.

If that's the case, then after step 2: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 becomes cyclohexyl-CH2-CH-CH3 with a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that's not right. The molecule after step 1 is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. If the triple bond is hydrogenated with a poisoned catalyst, it becomes a cis double bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH=CH3.

Wait, no, the structure would be cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3 → after hydrogenation with Lindlar's catalyst, it becomes cyclohexyl-C=CH2.

Wait, but the Lindlar's catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond, but the starting material is a terminal alkyne, so the product would be a cis-alkene.

So, after step 2 in option C, the product is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, the starting alkyne is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. If hydrogenated with Lindlar's catalyst (which I think is palladium on calcium carbonate with quinoline), the triple bond would become a cis double bond: cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH=CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, the structure after step 1 is cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3. So, hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the triple bond. With Lindlar's, it would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 (if full hydrogenation) or cyclohexyl-CH=CH2 (if partial, cis).

But H2/Pd as a catalyst usually leads to full hydrogenation.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is in option C, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the target structure again. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group, and another substituent that is a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group.

So, perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidation of a CH2 group adjacent to the ring. The substituent comes from another part.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a benzyl-type structure, which is then oxidized.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate to acetylide.

2. Alkylate to add a methyl group.

3. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form a CH2 group, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

But how to oxidize a CH2 group to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O (option A) are for that. So, after steps 1 and 2 (alkylation and hydrogenation), we have cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then Ba(OH)2 is used for elimination to form an alkene, which is then oxidized.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. In the presence of an alcohol, it could cause elimination. So, maybe after step 3, the molecule has an OH group. Then, step 4 oxidizes that to a ketone.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group, not a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is:

- Acetylide formation and alkylation to add a methyl group.

- Hydrogenation to form a CH2 group.

- Ozonolysis to break the molecule into fragments with carbonyl groups.

But without a double bond, ozonolysis doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the molecule is a diol, which upon oxidation gives a carbonyl.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not fully understanding the steps.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the target molecule has a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond, which upon hydrogenation becomes a CH2 group, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about each possible option's outcome.

Option C: After steps 1 and 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, ozone doesn't react. So, the next step is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; perhaps it abstracts a proton, causing elimination, forming a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm.

Option D: After step 1, maybe we have cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3. Then step 2, Li/NH3 → elimination to form a triple bond again, but that's not helpful.

Not seeing it.

Option B: After step 1, cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2, Li/NH3 → elimination to form a triple bond with a longer chain. Step 3, ozonolysis, but no double bond, so no reaction. Hmm.

Option A:After steps 1 and 2, the molecule is cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3. Step 3, Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination to form an alkene. Then step 4, Jones oxidation would oxidize the alkene's end to a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think:

After step 3, Ba(OH)2 may cause elimination, forming a double bond. So, cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3 → cyclohexyl-CH2-CH=CH2.

Then, step 4, H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → Jones oxidation would oxidize the alkene to a diol, but no, Jones is for oxidizing alcohols. Alternatively, maybe the alkene is cleaved into two carbonyls via ozonolysis, but in option A, step 4 is Jones, not ozonolysis.

Wait, maybe after Ba(OH)2, the molecule has an epoxide, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxidation, but that's usually done with peracids.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 in step 3 of option A is for dehydrogenation, forming a ketone.

But I'm not certain.

At this point, I think the correct answer is option C.

Wait, no, I'm not confident. Another approach: The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the formyl comes from an oxidation of a CH2 group adjacent to the ring, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another group.

So, the steps would be:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group to the triple bond.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a CH2 group.

3. Oxidize the CH2 group to a formyl group.

But how to do that.

Wait, perhaps the oxidation is done via ozonolysis after creating a double bond. So, the correct steps would be:

1. Acetylide formation and alkylation.

2. Reduction to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyls.

4. Work up.

So, looking for an option that includes these steps.

Option C: After step 2, H2/Pd → maybe a double bond. Then, step 3, O3/(CH3)2S → cleaves to form carbonyls.

Wait, but option C's step 2 is H2/Pd, which would probably hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, not a double bond. So, perhaps option C isn't the one.

Wait, unless the hydrogenation is partial, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C because it's the only one that includes ozonolysis, which would create a carbonyl group, and the rest of the steps fit.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm not fully confident. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll go with option C.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO), a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH), and a cyclohexylmethyl group (-CH2-cyclohexane). The analysis of the options involves evaluating the reagent sequences to determine which leads to the desired product.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide of ethynylcyclohexane and alkylates it with methyl chloride, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd**: Reduces the triple bond to a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly inducing elimination or oxidation, but the exact transformation is unclear.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Jones oxidation, which typically oxidizes alcohols or alkenes. However, the intermediate lacks a functional group that can be oxidized to form the target structure.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the desired product.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide and alkylates it with ethyl chloride, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly inducing elimination or rearrangement. However, the exact outcome is unclear.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the intermediate lacks one, so no reaction occurs.
4. **NH4OH**: Likely used for work-up, but no relevant transformation is evident.

This sequence does not produce the target molecule.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Forms the acetylide and alkylates it with methyl chloride, resulting in cyclohexyl-C≡C-CH3.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, yielding cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-CH3.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the intermediate lacks one, so no reaction occurs.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly inducing elimination or oxidation, but the exact transformation is unclear.

This sequence does not clearly lead to the desired product.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Forms the acetylide and reacts with methanol, possibly introducing a methyl group. However, methanol is a poor methylating agent for acetylides, so the exact product is uncertain.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: A strong base, possibly inducing elimination or rearrangement. However, the exact outcome is unclear.
3. **O3/(CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but the intermediate lacks one, so no reaction occurs.
4. **NH4OH**: Likely used for work-up, but no relevant transformation is evident.

This sequence does not produce the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, none of the sequences explicitly leads to the desired product, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is the most plausible choice, as it includes steps that could potentially lead to the formation of a carbonyl group via ozonolysis if a double bond were present. Despite uncertainties in the exact transformations, Option C aligns most closely with the required functional group transformations.

**Answer: C**
