Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says X is a meson resonance with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance from the options given.

Wait, right, when a particle decays, the mean lifetime is related to its width. I remember that the natural line width is connected to the particle's lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ, where Γ is the width, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, I'm being asked about the mean decay distance, not the lifetime.

Oh, right! The mean decay distance (also called the decay length) is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. To find that, I need to find the particle's speed, then multiply the speed by the mean lifetime. So, decay length L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity? I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E is given, and the mass is m, so the momentum p can be found using E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². 

Let me write that down: E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2). Then, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c.
