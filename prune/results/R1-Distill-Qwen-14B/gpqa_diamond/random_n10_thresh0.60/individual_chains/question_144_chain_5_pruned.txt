Okay, so I need to find the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, the mean lifetime is related to the particle's width. The decay width Γ is connected to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. I think the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but units are important here. Γ is given in MeV, so I need to make sure all the units are consistent.

Then, once I have the lifetime τ, I can find the mean decay distance. The formula should be something like distance = velocity * lifetime. So, I need to calculate the velocity of the meson X.

The meson's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. Wait, GeV is a unit of energy, but mass is in GeV/c², right? So I should probably convert these into more standard units like kilograms and meters per second.

Let me start by converting the mass. The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². To get it in kilograms, I know that 1 GeV is approximately 1.7827 x 10^-27 kg. So, m_X = 1.2 * 1.7827e-27 kg ≈ 2.139e-27 kg.

Next, the energy E is 8 GeV. The energy of a relativistic particle can be written as E = γ m c². So, γ = E / (m c²). Let me compute that. But wait, m c² is 1.2 GeV, so E = 8 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Once I have γ, I can find the velocity. The relation between γ and velocity is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). I can rearrange this to find v. Let me think: sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/γ → 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ² → v² = c² (1 - 1/γ²) → v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

Plugging in γ ≈ 6.6667, let's compute 1/γ² = (3/20)^2 = 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c. That's about 0.9887 times the speed of light, which is roughly 2.96e8 m/s. Wait, I can calculate it exactly: 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the lifetime τ. The width Γ is 320 MeV. Remember, Γ is the total decay width, and τ is related by τ = ħ / Γ. But units again: ħ has units of J·s, and Γ is in MeV, which is energy. So I
