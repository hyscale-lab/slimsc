Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. Alright, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. But what happens when the medium itself is moving?

So, the setup is a light beam moving through glass with index n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is, what's the speed of the light relative to the lab frame?

Wait, I think I need to use some relativity here. Because the glass is moving, but light's speed isn't just additive. Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add like in classical mechanics. So the speed of light in the lab frame should still be c, but wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. Oh, but the light is in glass, so normally its speed would be c/n. But because the glass is moving, does that change anything?

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. When the medium (glass) is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light in that medium. Normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But when the glass is moving, we have to apply a Lorentz transformation or
