Okay, so I've got this problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The reaction forms a new carbon-carbon bond, right?

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each giving a product. I need to find the correct reactants and products for each, then match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's like a malonate enolate, but wait, in this case, what's the structure? Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH-, but wait, no, wait. Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. So the beta position is the central CH2. So when it acts as a nucleophile, the enolate part is the alpha carbon attacking the beta position of the other carbonyl. 

Wait, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, the substituents are on the double bond. So, the structure is CH2-CH-(p-tolyl) attached to the double bond. Wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=C-O-(p-tolyl)... No, wait, no. Let me think again. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So acrylate is CH2=CHCOO- group. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the substituent is on the third carbon? But acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl), that would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)(O)OCH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is on the double
