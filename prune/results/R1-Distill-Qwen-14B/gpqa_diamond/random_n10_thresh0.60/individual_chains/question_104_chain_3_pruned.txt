Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So, both planets are probably in the same kind of orbital setup in terms of mass. But their detected spectral line shifts are different.

The RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves towards and away from us because the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is, the bigger the shift. Wait, but the shift also depends on the mass of the star, the planet, and the orbital period or something else?

The question states that planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom. So, the shifts are different. I remember that the semi-amplitude (K) of the radial velocity is given by some formula. Let me recall... I think it's K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (something involving orbital period? Wait, no, the exact formula might be a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the radial velocity semi-amplitude equation. I think the formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) )

But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I think when the planet's mass is the same and the star's mass is the same, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or wait, maybe K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/ something?)... Hmm, maybe I should look at the simplified version for when M_p is
