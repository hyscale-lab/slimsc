Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still learning all these reactions. The question involves a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and going through several steps to produce a final product. The options are A, B, C, D, and I need to find out which structure corresponds to product 4.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me draw that structure mentally. So, cyclohexanone ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). At position 5, it's prop-1-en-2-yl, which is an isopropenyl group. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3, but the substituent here is prop-1-en-2-yl, so the structure would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2)- something. Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl group would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2- attached via the second carbon. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the parent chain is propene, with the substituent attached to the second carbon. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2-)– but wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-C=CH? No, maybe I should think of it as CH2=C(CH3) as the substituent. Wait, no. Let me draw it properly.

Propene is CH2=CHCH3. If it's prop-1-en-2-yl, that means the substituent is attached to the second carbon of propene. So the group is CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2=C(CH2–). No, wait: another approach. The substituent is an allyl group but in a specific position. Maybe
