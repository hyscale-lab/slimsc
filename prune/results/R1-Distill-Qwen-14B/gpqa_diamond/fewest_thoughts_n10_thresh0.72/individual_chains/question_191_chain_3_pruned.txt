Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-C(=CH2)-. Oh, wait, no. I think it's CH2=CH-CH2- but attached at the central carbon? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2- but as a substituent on the cyclohexane? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH=CH2 with the substituent at the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2 attached to the cyclohexane, then a double bond to CH2. Wait, maybe it's (allyl group) but with the substituent at the middle carbon. So, the substituent on the cyclohexane is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So, CH2-CH2-CH2, but the middle two carbons are double-bonded. So like CH2-CH2-CH2 becomes CH2-CH=CH2, but with the substituent on the middle carbon? Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as the group is (CH2)2C-CH2? Wait, perhaps it's more accurately represented as (CH2)CH2-CH2, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2
