Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which usually happens when the molecule has a chiral center, which is a carbon attached to four different groups. But wait, there's more to it sometimes, like if there's a plane of symmetry or some other factors.

Let's look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure here: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but substituted. The formula is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, maybe I should draw it. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so structure is Cl-C(R)=CHCH2CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be on the first carbon, which is the double bond carbon. So the structure is Cl attached to the double bond. Wait, but double bonds are spÂ² hybridized. So the first carbon is CHCl, which is connected to CH2CH2? Hmm, I'm not sure. Wait, but for a double bond, the substituents are on the same carbon. So the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe it's CH2=C(CH2CH3)Cl? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2Cl? No, wait, the substituents are on the second carbon. Oh wait, the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group. So structure is Cl-C(=CHCH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or Cl-C(CH3)=CHCH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl on the first carbon, which is
