Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum, and choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the potential often influences the energy levels, especially in systems like the harmonic oscillator. So maybe this potential can be broken down into components that resemble harmonic oscillators in different directions.

First, let's analyze the potential V(r, θ). So, V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, can I rewrite this in terms of Cartesian coordinates? Because sometimes working in Cartesian makes it easier to recognize the form of the potential.

I recall that in polar coordinates, r² cos²θ is x², since x = r cosθ. So x = r cosθ implies x² = r² cos²θ. So let's substitute that in.

So V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k (x²). Wait, but wait, isn't r² equal to x² + y²? Because in polar coordinates, r^2 = x² + y². So substituting that in, V becomes (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

Let me compute that. The first term is (1/2)k x² + (1/2)k y². The second term is (3/2)k x². Adding them together, the x² terms are (1/2 + 3/2) k x² = 2k x². So, overall, the potential V is (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

Wait, let me double-check that. The first term is (1/2 k)(x²+y²) plus (3/2 k x²). So (1/2 x² + 1/2 y²) + (3/2 x²)
