Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about a meson resonance called X. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their mean path length is related to their lifetime and velocity. But wait, how exactly does that work?

The data given are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Oh, right, the width is related to the particle's lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The formula I think I should use is the mean lifetime τ, but wait, the mean decay distance is the product of the speed (v) times the lifetime (τ). So the formula should be something like decay distance d = v * τ.

But how do I get τ from the given width Γ? I recall that the natural line width is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense because the width is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

Wait, so then the decay distance would be d = v * (ħ / Γ). But I need to find v, the velocity of the meson. How do I find v from the given energy and mass?

The particle is produced with energy E_X, which is 8 GeV. Since the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, I can use the relativistic energy formula E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think that's right. So I can solve for p (momentum), and then get velocity from p and m.

Let me write down the equations. E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c. Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange correctly: (pc) = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ). So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c². Wait, maybe I should write E in terms of GeV, m in GeV, and c in appropriate units, but I'm getting a bit confused with the units here.

Alternatively, I can compute the velocity beta (β = v/c) using β = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)) ). Because relativistic beta is given by sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)). So that's another way.

Wait, but E is the total energy. So E = gamma m c^2, and the momentum p is gamma m v. So the velocity beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

So I can calculate beta as sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2 c^4)). Wait, no, wait: E is in units where c is factored in. Let me think in terms of units where c=1. So E is in GeV, m is GeV/c², but when using E and m in GeV units, perhaps I can ignore c? Hmm, maybe it's easier to convert everything into consistent units.

Alternatively, perhaps using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. So energy and mass have the same units. So with c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2). Then, the velocity beta is p/E. Because in natural units, E = gamma m, and p = gamma m v, so beta = v = p/(gamma m) = (p/E) * (E/(gamma m)) )? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let's think again.

In natural units, v = beta c, but c is 1, so v = beta. So beta = p / E. Because p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m. So beta = v = (p)/(gamma m) = p/E.

So beta = p/E, where p is in GeV, E is in GeV. So let me compute p. p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) = sqrt( (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 ) GeV. 8 squared is 64, 1.2 squared is 1.44. So 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So beta is p/E = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c. That's pretty fast, which makes sense because the energy is much higher than the mass.

Now, the lifetime tau is ħ / Gamma. Gamma is given as 320 MeV. Wait, but ħ has units of GeV·s. Hmm, let me think about units. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Gamma. ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32 )e-25 s ≈ 20.56875e-25 s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Wait, no: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s = 20.
