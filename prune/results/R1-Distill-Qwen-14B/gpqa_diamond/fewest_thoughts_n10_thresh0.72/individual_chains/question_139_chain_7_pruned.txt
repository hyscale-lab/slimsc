Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. So, the question is about determining the starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. The products given are 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione and 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione.

Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds react with HCl, NaNO2, and water, they undergo diazotization and then hydrolysis. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like the formation of carbocations upon heating, which can then lead to rearrangements or the formation of ketones if the carbocation is adjacent to an oxygen group.

Wait, another thought: I think this might be related to the Beckmann rearrangement. Oh right, Beckmann rearrangement involves oximes (which are formed from ketones or aldehydes and hydroxylamine) reacting under acidic conditions to form amides. But wait, in this reaction, HCl, NaNO2, and water are used. That sounds more like the conditions for the formation of diazonium salts, which typically come from aromatic amines. But these products are diketones, not aromatic compounds.

Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh! I think this could be the formation of carbonyl groups via the hydrolysis of diazonium salts. Diazonium salts of alkyl halides can form carbocations when treated with H2O or other nucleophiles. So perhaps the starting materials are alcohols that, upon treatment, get converted into nitro compounds and then into carbocations that rearrange into ketones.

Wait, here's a thought: Maybe the starting materials are secondary alcohols. When a secondary alcohol reacts with nitrous acid (HCl and NaNO2), it can form a diazonium salt in situ, which then undergoes hydrolysis. But wait, secondary alcohols typically don't form stable diazonium salts. Oh, right, only aromatic amines form diazonium salts. So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Wait another angle: The products are diketones. How can a reaction produce a diketone? One possibility is the oxidation of a diol (a 1,2-diol, or
