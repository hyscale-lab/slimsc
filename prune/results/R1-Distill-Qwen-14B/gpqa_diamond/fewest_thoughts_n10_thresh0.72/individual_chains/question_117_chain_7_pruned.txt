Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question is asking which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the compound is not superimposable on its mirror image. So, I need to check each option to see if they have any chiral centers.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can have some interesting stereochemistry. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each benzene ring. Wait, but wait, the substituents are on the biphenyl group. Since the biphenyl can rotate, but in some cases, if there are bulky groups, it can lead to atropisomerism. Oh right, atropisomers are a type of stereoisomer where the rotation around the bond is restricted. So if the substituents are such that the molecule can't easily twist into a planar form, it can have enantiomers. So in this case, the nitro groups are at 6,6' positions. Let me visualize: two nitro groups on opposite sides of the biphenyl. The methyl ester groups are on the 2 and 2' positions. So the substituents on each benzene are 2,6-dinitro and the ester groups. Wait, no, each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2? Or are they both on the same ring? No, no, it's a biphenyl, meaning two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So each ring has substituents. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and an ester group at position 2. But wait, no, the formula is 6,6'-dinitro, so each ring has a nitro at 6. So each benzene ring has substituents at 2, 2', 6, 6'. Are these substituents arranged in such a way that they cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or exhibit some form of asymmetry
