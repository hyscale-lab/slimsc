Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of six different benzene derivatives with excess bromine. Each of these substances reacts to form a monobromo derivative, and we're supposed to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are labeled A to D.

First, I need to understand what each substituent does to the benzene ring in terms of directing the incoming electrophile. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the substituents attached to the benzene ring because they can activate or deactivate the ring and direct the incoming group to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para.

So, each of the substituents here is attached to the benzene ring. Let me list them out:

1) С6H5-CH3: This is toluene, so the substituent is a methyl group.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: This looks like an ethyl ester group, so the substituent is OOCR where R is ethyl. So it's an ester group.
3) C6H5-Cl: The substituent is a chlorine atom.
4) C6H5-NO2: The substituent is a nitro group.
5) C6H5-C2H5: Hmm, wait, that's ethylbenzene, so the substituent is an ethyl group.
6) C6H5-COOH: This is benzoic acid, substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

Wait, but in the context of substitution reactions, the substituents can be activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directors.

Let me recall the directing effects:

- Activating groups (electron-donating) are typically ortho/para directors. Examples include -O-, -NH2, -OH, alkyl groups (like CH3, C2H5), etc.
- Deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing) are typically meta directors. Examples include -NO2, -COOH, -COOR (esters), -Cl (but wait, Cl is a bit tricky; it's a deactivating group but ortho/para director because of resonance but also meta due to inductive effect. But for the most part, Cl is meta, especially in some cases.)

Wait, so let's think about each substituent:

1) Methyl (CH3): It's an activating, alkyl group. So it's an ortho/para director. So in substitution reactions, the incoming group tends to go para or ortho.

But when the substituent is bulky, like a methyl group, steric effects can cause the para position to be favored more. So for a substituent like methyl, the major product is para, probably.

Wait, but benzene with a substituent like CH3 will have more para product than ortho because of steric hindrance. So the para isomer is more favored.

2) Ethyl ester (COOEt): The substituent is an ester group, which is an electron-withdrawing group. Ester is a meta director. So the incoming
