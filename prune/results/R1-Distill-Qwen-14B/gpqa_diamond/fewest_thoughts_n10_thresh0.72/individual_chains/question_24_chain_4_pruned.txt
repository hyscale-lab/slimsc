Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem involves mixtures X and Y, and a substance Z. I'll try to break down each part.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, what kinds of compounds cause bromine water to decolorize? I remember that alkenes (double bonds) and alkynes can do this because bromine adds across the double or triple bonds, breaking them and making the solution colorless. Also, maybe some aromatic compounds can do it, but I think in this context, it's more likely alkenes or alkynes.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but two different liquids, and Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, the reaction after treatment with Pt (platinum) is probably a hydrogenation reaction, adding hydrogen. But wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh wait, no, the product is formed as a result of disproportionation. Hmm, so maybe the starting materials in X are undergoing a disproportionation reaction, which is a type of redox reaction where one species is both oxidized and reduced.

Wait, that's a key point. So, during this treatment with Pt (which is a catalyst), the components of X are undergoing a disproportionation, meaning each molecule is splitting into two parts, one part being oxidized and the other reduced. So, perhaps each component in X is a compound that can undergo this kind of reaction.

But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So each component in X, when treated with Pt (and maybe H2?), undergoes a disproportionation. But wait, the question says it's treated with platinum when heatedâ€”does that mean hydrogen is present? Because Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Oh, but then the reaction is a disproportionation, so maybe it's not hydrogenation but some other reaction, like dehydrohalogenation or something else. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, another angle: the products Y don't decolorize bromine water, which suggests that their double bonds are hydrogenated. So maybe the reaction is hydrogenation but in a way that leads to a change in the structure, perhaps breaking a
