Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data after a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

So, the reaction is between Compound X and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, what does that do? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. But wait, Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides from epoxides, right? Or maybe it's used for other oxidations... Hmm, no, Sharpless is specifically for epoxidizing certain dienes, like allylic alcohols. But wait, in this case, the product's NMR suggests some kind of epoxide. Because I see in the product's 1H NMR, there are some downfield shifts, maybe epoxide protons? Or not necessarily, because epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm as broad peaks, but maybe in this case, something else is going on.

Wait, the product's NMR data: the 1H NMR shows several signals. Let me list them out. 

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): That's a singlet, probably a methyl group attached to something de-shielded, maybe an oxygen like a carbonyl or an epoxide. Or maybe it's attached to an aromatic ring, but that's less likely because methyl on aromatic tends to be around 2.3-2.5 usually as a singlet.

- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, same region as the above. So maybe two methyl groups attached to similar environments.

Then, the aromatic region:

- δ 6.75 (1H, d): Doublet, probably part of a coupling in a di-substituted aromatic ring.

- δ 7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet.

- δ 7.
