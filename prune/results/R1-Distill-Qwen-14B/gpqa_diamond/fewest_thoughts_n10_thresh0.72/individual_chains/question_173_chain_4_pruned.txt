Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the uncertainty principle. I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, I think the actual formula might have a 2π factor, but sometimes people use ħ/2 instead of ℏ which is h/(2π). Oh right, ħ is h/(2π), so the uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Or wait, maybe it's usually written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. I should double-check that.

But wait, the problem is asking about the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Hmm, because the electron's speed is given, and the position uncertainty, so I'm supposed to find the minimum uncertainty in energy. Oh, right, because energy is related to momentum. So first, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum, then relate that to kinetic energy.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Use the Uncertainty Principle to find Δp.
2. Use the momentum to find the kinetic energy, which will give ΔE.

Wait, but wait. The electron has a certain momentum p = mv. Since we know its speed, and assuming non-relativistic speeds? Let me check the speed given: 2e8
