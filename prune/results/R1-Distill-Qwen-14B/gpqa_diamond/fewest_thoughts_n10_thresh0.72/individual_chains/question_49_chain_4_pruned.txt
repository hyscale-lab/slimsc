Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. These reactions involve the migration of a pi bond into a sigma bond, right? Examples like Cope and Claisen rearrangements come to mind, and I think they're all thermodynamically favored.

The problem has three parts, each leading to a product, labeled A, B, and C. I need to determine which set of products is correct from the given options. Let's look at each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form product A. Hmm. I'm trying to remember what kind of reaction conditions these are. H+ probably acts as a catalyst, maybe protonating something to make it more reactive. I think when we have amines and alcohols with some kind of conjugated system, we might be looking at some kind of rearrangement or possibly a condensation reaction.

Wait, wait. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The amine has two methoxy groups attached to the same carbon as the amine. The alcohol is but-3-en-2-ol, which has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and an OH on carbon 2. So structure-wise, the alcohol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, let me visualize it. The but-3-en-2-ol structure: the double bond is between C2 and C3, because but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2 where the OH is on C2. Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait but that's more like 3-en-2-ol of butane. So
