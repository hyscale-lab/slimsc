Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question carefully and think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem is about the dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NMR data is provided, and there's a NOESY spectrum involved.

So first, let me break down the information. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration of such a compound typically forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR is given: 1H has a single peak at 7 ppm, and 13C has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Hmm, I remember that in anhydrides, the carbonyl carbons are around 165-185 ppm. The 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe a double bond. Wait, or maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, but I'm not sure.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. 7 ppm is in the aromatic region, but wait, the starting material was a cis-alkene. Oh, wait, dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride. Wait, if the starting material has a cis-alkene, when it dehydrates, the geometry of the double bond might become trans, but I'm not certain. Maybe the product is a cyclic anhydride, like a five-membered ring, which would have a certain structure.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That could be from an aromatic ring, but the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or an aromatic system, but the dehydrated product would probably have a double bond. A peak at 7 ppm could be from an aromatic proton, but if it's an anhydride, perhaps it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated anhydride. The alpha protons in such a system would typically be around 6-7 ppm as they're deshielded.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think: the 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl carbon (like in an anhydride). The 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe a double bond. So the structure is probably an alpha,beta-unsaturated anhydride. That would have a conjugated system: the carbonyl (C=O) next to a double bond (C=C). So the 137 ppm would be the carbon in the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, in the 1H NMR, if the anhydride has a
