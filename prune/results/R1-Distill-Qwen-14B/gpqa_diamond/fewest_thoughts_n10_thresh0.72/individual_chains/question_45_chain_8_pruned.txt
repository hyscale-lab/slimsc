Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see, the question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm.

Wait, right, the particles are spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can occupy the same quantum state, including spin. But since the potential is one-dimensional, each particle has a quantum number n and a spin state. Oh, right, because spin is another quantum number, so for each spatial state, there are two possible spin states (up and down).

The well has length L, and the energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Or, as the problem states, E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each level is E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

Now, since it's a one-dimensional infinite potential well, each particle is in a state with some n. But because the particles are identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion. So each spatial state can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down). Wait, no—actually, each unique spatial wavefunction can hold two particles, each with opposite spins.

So with four particles, we need to figure out how to fill up the lowest energy states without violating the Pauli principle.

Let me think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. Since each n can hold two particles, let's see:

n=1 can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more. But wait, four particles. So the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. So in that case, all four are filled up to n=2. So the energies would be the sum of each state's energy multiplied by the number of particles in that state.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the total energy is the sum of the energies of each particle. So for each particle, their energy is E_n for their respective n. So if two particles are in n=1, each contributes E_1 = E*(1)^2 = E. Two particles in n=2, each contributes E_2 = E*(2)^2=4E. So total energy is (2*E) + (2*4E) = 2E +8E=10E. Wait, but the options have 4E as an option sometimes. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait
