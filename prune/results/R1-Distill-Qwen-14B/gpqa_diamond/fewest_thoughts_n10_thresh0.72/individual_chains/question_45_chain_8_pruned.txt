Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies for four identical particles. Each particle has spin-1/2, which I remember means they can have spin up or down. Since they're identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, that's the one where no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

So first, let's recall the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well. The energy levels are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which the problem defines as E multiplied by n squared. So E = (π² ħ²)/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E.

Wait, but for four fermions, each with spin-1/2, each particle can have two possible spin states (up or down). So each spatial state (a particular n) can hold two fermions with different spins. So the maximum number of particles that can occupy the same spatial state is two.

Now, the particles are spin-1/2, so each can have spin up or down. So for each n, two particles can occupy that state with different spins.

We need to arrange four particles into the lowest possible energy states. Let's go step by step.

Ground State:
The lowest energy state is when the particles are in the lowest possible energy levels. Since each level can hold two particles, the first two particles go into n=1 with spins up and down. Then, the next two go into n=2. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Each n can hold two particles, so n=1 can take two, n=2 can take two. But four particles would fill n=1 (2) and n=2 (2). So their energies would be (1² + 1² + 2² + 2²) E? Wait, no, each particle's energy is n² E, so the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no! Wait a second. No, that
