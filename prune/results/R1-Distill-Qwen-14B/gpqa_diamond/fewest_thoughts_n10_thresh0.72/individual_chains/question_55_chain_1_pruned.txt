Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is. Let's see, the options are all propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on NMR, but I'll try to think it through.

The NMR data given is: 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d). So I'll need to break this down.

First, the acetate group. Acetate is OAc, which is an ester. The acetate's methyl group is usually a singlet around 2.1 ppm, which matches the 2.1 peak here. So that's the OAc part. Now, the rest of the peaks must be from the propenyl or butenyl group.

Looking at the other signals: the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a coupling J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling. In NMR, a doublet with J around 16 Hz suggests a trans coupling between two aromatic protons, but wait, wait. Oh, but in this case, these aren't aromatic protons. Maybe it's a trans coupling in a vinyl group.

Wait, but the other part is 5.5 ppm, a doublet of quartets. Hmm. Let's think about the structure.

So the molecule is an acetate, so the ester is OAc-O-C-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group. Wait, no. The structure for an ester is R-O-C-O-R', where R' is the acetyl group. So the R group is attached to the oxygen.

Wait, the R group is either propenyl or butenyl. Let me think about propenyl first. Propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH=CH2, but wait, no, the substituent is attached via the oxygen, so perhaps it's something like CH2CH2CH2-OAc, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. The R group is an allyl group. So, for propenyl acetate, the
