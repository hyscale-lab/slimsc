Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Wait, wait, I need to figure out what that means and what the product would be.

First, let me think about the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait, wait. Oh, wait, that's 1-bromo-2,3-didehydrobenzene? Or is it 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene? Wait, no, benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. If it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-didehydrobenzene. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,3-dihydrobenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3-didehydro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene? Hmm, perhaps I should look it up. Oh wait, no, I can't, I'm just thinking.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some terms. Let me think. The name 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, perhaps "d" stands for something. Oh, wait, sometimes the "d" suffix is used in nomenclature for dehydro structures. Like, for example, benzene has a structure with alternating double bonds. If one double bond
