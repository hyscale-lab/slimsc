Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about an annihilation process involving protons and antiprotons producing some particles A. 

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of each charge, A⁺ and A⁻. I'm supposed to find the velocity of particle A.

The given data is that the antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess that means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," so maybe its velocity is low, but I'm not sure if that's important yet. The rest mass energy of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, masses are often given in MeV/c².

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So, I think I'll need to use conservation laws here, probably conservation of energy and momentum. Because in any closed system, energy and momentum are conserved, so that's a good starting point.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about their rest masses. The proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², right? And the antiproton has the same mass because it's the antimatter counterpart. So each has a rest energy of 938 MeV. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy? Or perhaps not, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, but in the reaction, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton is probably at rest because the antiproton is moving towards it, but I'm not certain. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, but it doesn't specify whether the proton is moving or not. Hmm, perhaps I should assume that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it. So, the initial momentum would be just that of the antiproton.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that both are moving towards each other, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. Hmm, perhaps the setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with a low velocity. So the initial system's total energy would be the sum of the proton's rest energy plus the antiproton's total energy, which would be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest energy. So maybe we can approximate the energy as just the rest energy plus a small term? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the antiproton is moving so slowly that its kinetic energy is negligible, so its total energy is approximately its rest energy. That might simplify things.

So the initial system has a proton at rest (so its energy is m_p c²) and the antiproton moving with velocity v_p (but if it's slow, v_p is much less than c, so maybe we can approximate its energy as m_p c² plus a small KE, but perhaps I can treat it as m_p c² for simplicity, but perhaps that's not correct because it's moving, so its energy includes gamma times m_p c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But if it's moving slowly, gamma is close to 1, so maybe it's approximately m_p c² plus (1/2) m_p v_p². Hmm, but I don't have the velocity given. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the velocity of the antiproton, just that it's moving slowly. So perhaps I should model it as having some velocity, but I'm not given that information.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric in some way. Let me think: the reaction produces two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. So maybe the charges are balanced, but that might not help with the velocities.

Let me consider the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial system's momentum depends on the antiproton's motion, but if the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, their combined momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

After the annihilation, the four particles (two A⁺ and two A⁻) are produced. So the total momentum of the system after the reaction must equal the total momentum before.

But given that the initial system's momentum is just the momentum of the moving antiproton, and assuming the proton is at rest. So, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p, where gamma_p is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton. Hmm, but I don't know v_p. Wait, but maybe I can consider that the antiproton is moving so slowly that gamma_p is approximately 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v_p. But without knowing v_p, I'm stuck. Hmm,
