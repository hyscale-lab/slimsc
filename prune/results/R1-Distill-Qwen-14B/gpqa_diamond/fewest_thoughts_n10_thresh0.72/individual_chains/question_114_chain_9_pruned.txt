Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question has two parts, each involving different reagents. I need to figure out which reagents A and B are used in each reaction.

First, let's look at the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one, which I know is (CH3)2CO. The reagents used are NaCN and A, and the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, what's that structure? Butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CN, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw it out. So the molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Or perhaps it's (CH3)2CH(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but butanenitrile would be four carbons in a row, with the nitrile group at the end.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile group is on carbon 1, and the hydroxy is on carbon 2, which also has a methyl group. So the structure is (CH3)C(OH)-CH2CN? Wait, but wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is at the end. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH(CH3)CN? Or perhaps (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the reaction.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you react a ketone with a cyanide source, like NaCN, under certain conditions, you can get a cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrin formation typically involves the addition of a cyanide nucleophile to the carbonyl group. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen becomes an oxonium ion, which is attacked by the cyanide. Then, the oxygen picks up a proton, leading to the formation of a hydr
