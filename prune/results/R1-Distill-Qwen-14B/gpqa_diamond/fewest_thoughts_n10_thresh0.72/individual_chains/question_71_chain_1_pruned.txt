Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets in a system of five exoplanets. These planets are in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The albedo is the same for all, so that should simplify things a bit.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula, I think, is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo)/absorptivity )^0.25. Wait, but since albedo is the same for all, that part will cancel out when taking the ratio. So maybe I can ignore the albedo for this calculation.

Wait, the star's temperature is the same for all planets since they're orbiting the same star, right? So T_star is the same for all. That means when I take the ratio of the temperatures of Planet 4 and Planet 2, the T_star part will cancel out.

So equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact formula right. Oh right, the formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/epsilon )^0.25. But when we're taking the ratio of two planets, the (1 - A)/
