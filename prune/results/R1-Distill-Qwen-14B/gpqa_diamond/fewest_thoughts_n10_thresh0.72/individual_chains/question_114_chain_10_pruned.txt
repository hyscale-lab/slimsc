Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read the problem again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D each with different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via some kind of substitution. Oh wait, the reaction of ketones with cyanide (like NaCN) must be nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones don't usually get substituted like that. Oh wait, maybe it's a case of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yes, that's right! Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the first reaction is a acid-catalyzed addition of cyanide to a ketone.

In the formation of a cyanohydrin, the ketone's carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a new carbon-nitrogen bond. The proton from the acid is transferred to the oxygen, which then leaves as water. Wait, no, wait. Actually, when the cyanide attacks, the oxygen becomes an -O- which then gets protonated again, right? So the reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or something else that can protonate.

Looking at the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN and A to give a cyanohydrin. So for the first step, A should be a strong acid, maybe H3O+ (like in sulfuric acid or another strong acid). So looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A, whereas C and D have NaHSO3. Hmm, but what's the role of NaHSO3? I think NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and SO3^2-; it's often used in certain substitutions, maybe for protecting groups or something else. But in cyanohydrin formation, the acid is usually strong, like H2SO4, HCl, or H3O+.

So for the first part, reagent A is probably H3O+. So that would narrow the options down to A or B for the first part.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Let me see. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions involve either strong acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, you usually use H2SO4 and heat, sometimes with water. Alternatively, in basic
