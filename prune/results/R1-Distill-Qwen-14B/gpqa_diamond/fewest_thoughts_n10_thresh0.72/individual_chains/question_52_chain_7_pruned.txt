Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars and their spectral lines, specifically about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Alright, let's read the problem again carefully. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The key part is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes—without spots compared to with spots.

I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation states of atoms depend on the temperature. The Saha equation comes into play here, which relates the ionization states of atoms to the temperature and electron density. But since the problem mentions that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for the energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the ratio in question is the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2, or the other way around? The problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So let's clarify: when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K.

The ratio of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Since the energy difference (E2-E1) is positive (assuming E2 > E1), if temperature decreases, the exponential term will decrease, making the ratio n1/n2 smaller. So the ratio is decreasing when T goes down, which matches the problem statement.

We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me compute the ratio for both temperatures. Let’s denote T1 as 6000 K and T2 as 5500 K.

The Boltzmann factor is exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Wait no, the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Because E2 > E1, so E2-E1 is positive, and when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio (n1/n2) smaller.

Wait, maybe I should write the ratio as n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So, if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n1/n2 decreases as observed.

So the factor is (n1/n2)_T1 divided by (n1/n2)_T2. Let's compute that.

Factor = [ (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] 

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out.

Factor = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

= exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

= exp( (ΔE)/(k) [ (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ] )

Wait, I think I can compute ΔE using the wavelength given. The transition between the levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. So the energy difference is related to the photon's energy via ΔE = hc/λ.

Yes, that's right. So ΔE = hc / λ.

But wait, the exact value of ΔE might not be needed if we can work with ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the exponentials can be calculated using the temperature change.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio can be approximated using the formula for the ratio of two blackbody emissions or something similar, but I don't think that's directly applicable here.

Let me compute the exponent first.

Compute (ΔE) = hc/(λ) = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448
