Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll think through what each part means.

So the setup is that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they gave these to mice orally. When they did in vivo imaging, some GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, because the stomach has a lot of acid, which can break down proteins. So that part makes sense—the proteins wouldn't survive the acidic environment, meaning maybe only some of them reach the intestines.

Then, some of the GFP-tagged proteins got entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Wait, secondary lymphoid organs include places like the Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines. So the proteins that made it past the stomach acid would reach the intestines, but some got stuck in the mucus, maybe not reaching the lymphoid tissues. But the ones that did reach the Peyer patches were fluorescent and then they isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

So the question is about which process is happening. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me recall each of these processes. Somatic hypermutation occurs in B cells after they've been activated. It's a mechanism that introduces mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, leading to a diverse set of antibodies. This process allows the immune system to produce a wide variety of specific antibodies, which is important for fighting infections.

Complement activation—I think that's part of the innate immune response. The complement system helps in killing pathogens and enhances the ability of antibodies to clear foreign substances.

Class switching recombination is when a B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG) without changing the antigen specificity. This involves recombination of the heavy chain genes.

VDJ recombination is a process that occurs during the maturation of B and T cells in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. It's how the variable regions of antibodies and T cell receptors are generated by shuffling V, D, and J segments. This leads to the initial diversity of the immune receptors.

In this experiment, after the GFP-tagged proteins are delivered, some make it to the Peyer patches. The Peyer patches are sites where a lot of B cells reside, especially B cells that are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). So when the proteins are taken up by these B cells, they probably get processed, and the immune system responds by generating antibodies.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that the B cells are undergoing some process that increases diversity. Somatic hypermutation is a process that happens after the initial diversity generated by VDJ recombination. It's during the germinal center reactions where B cells proliferate and their B cell receptors (BCRs) undergo hypermutation, leading to more diverse antibodies.

Wait, but VDJ recombination happens during the initial stages of B cell development in the bone marrow. So when the B cells are activated upon encountering the antigen (rotavirus proteins here), they go through the germinal centers and undergo somatic hypermutation. This process increases the diversity of the antibodies they produce, which is why sequencing the variable regions shows high variability.

So the process in question is likely somatic hypermutation. The other options don't fit as well. Complement activation is more about the innate response and not directly about generating variability in the B cell receptors. Class switching is about changing the isotype, not the variable regions. VDJ is about initial diversity but not the ongoing hypermutation that occurs after antigen exposure.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some of the GFP fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins become entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. The fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

To determine the process responsible for this variability, the following options are considered:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during germinal center reactions. It introduces mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, increasing antibody diversity. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes aligns with this process.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly contribute to the variability in B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) without altering antigen specificity. It does not explain the observed variability in the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This generates initial diversity in B cell receptors during early B cell development in the bone marrow. However, it occurs before antigen exposure and does not account for the ongoing variability observed in this experiment.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after antigen exposure and during the immune response in the germinal centers. This process is consistent with the observed results.
