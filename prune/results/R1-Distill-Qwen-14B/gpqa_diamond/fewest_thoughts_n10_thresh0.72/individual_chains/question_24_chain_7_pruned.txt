Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

The problem starts by talking about a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the presence of double bonds, like alkenes or alkynes, which can undergo addition reactions. So mixture X must contain some unsaturated compounds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So, Y doesn't have any double bonds anymore. That suggests that the reaction with Pt caused the unsaturated compounds in X to hydrogenate. But wait, the question says it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh right, disproportionation is when a single substance is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe the starting material in X is a compound that can undergo such a reaction.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Hmm. So perhaps each of these two liquids in X undergoes a different reaction pathway when treated with Pt. Let me think, maybe each of them is a di-substituted alkene or something else that can undergo different reactions.

Moving on, the hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7 (since 14.28 is about 1/7 of 100). Then, Z is a hydrocarbon and a constituent of Y, and it's widely used as a solvent. Common solvents with high hydrogen content might be alkanes like hexane or something similar. But let me calculate the exact composition.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So the molecular formula of Z must be such that the hydrogen contributes 1/7 of the molar mass. Let's assume Z is CnH2n+2 (since it's an alkane from hydrogenation). The formula for the mass fraction of hydrogen is (2n+2)/(12n + 2+ 2) ) * 100% = 14.28%. Let me compute that.

Wait, the formula for Z is CnH2m
