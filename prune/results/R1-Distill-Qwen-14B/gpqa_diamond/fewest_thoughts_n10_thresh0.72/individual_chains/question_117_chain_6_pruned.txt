Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? Those are also called enantiomers, and they can cause plane-polarized light to rotate in opposite directions. So the question is about which of the given compounds show this kind of isomerism.

The question lists four organic moieties, 1 to 4, and the options are combinations of these. Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so this is a biphenyl compound. Biphenyls can have different types of isomerism. Wait, since it's a biphenyl, specifically at positions [1,1'], so the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' for the carboxylate groups, and 6 and 6' for the nitro groups.

I remember that for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or a plane of symmetry that allows for enantiomers. Biphenyls can have what's called geometric isomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that they are trans or cis around the single bond between the rings. Oh wait, but for optical isomerism, I think the molecule needs to have a center of chirality or some sort of stereogenic element.

Wait, this molecule has two nitro groups at 6 and 6' and two ester groups at 2 and 2' on each ring. Let me visualize this. The biphenyl has two rings connected by a single bond. The substituents at 2 and 2' are on the same ring? Or on opposite rings? Let me think: the numbering is 6,6' on the nitro, so each ring has a nitro group on the same position relative to the connecting bond.

Wait, wait, in biphenyl, the substituents on each ring can be either para, meta, or ortho to the connecting bond. So, 2,2' would be meta on each ring relative to the single bond. Hmm. Now, for the entire molecule, does it have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are symmetrically placed
