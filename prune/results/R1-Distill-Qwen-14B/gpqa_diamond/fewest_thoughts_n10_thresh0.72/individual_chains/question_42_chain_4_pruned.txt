Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, so there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits discovered via the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? I think that method relies on the gravitational interactions between the planets causing changes in their transit times, so the presence of multiple planets can be detected that way. But maybe that's not directly relevant to the problem. Let's move on.

The question gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets. Between Planet1 and Planet2, the ratio is about 1.4. So, Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's. Wait, or is it Planet2 to Planet1? Hmm, the way it's phrased: "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So I think it's T1/T2 = 1.4. Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3? Or T3/T2? Wait, no, the way it's written, it's "between Planet2 and Planet3," so I'm guessing T2 over T3 is 2.3. So T2 = 2.3 * T3.

Then, the mass ratios: the mass of Planet1 over Planet2 is about 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 1.35. So M1/M2 = 1.15, and M2/M3 = 1.35.

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1. So we need to find P3/P1.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth's. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature, but since it's the same for all, it cancels out when taking the ratios.

Let me think about the formula for equilibrium temperature. The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by the formula:

T = [(L / (16 * π * σ * D^2)) * (1 - a)]^(1/4)

Where L
