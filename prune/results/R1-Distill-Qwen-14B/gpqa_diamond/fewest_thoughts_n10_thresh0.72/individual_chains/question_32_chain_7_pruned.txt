Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, let's see. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 maybe? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons add up to 6 nucleons, so that's the isotope.

The problem says the speed is 0.96c. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use relativistic equations, not classical ones. The energy here is probably the total relativistic energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC, which I think is the kinetic energy, but sometimes people use different terms. Or is it the total energy? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they often refer to the kinetic energy per particle. Or is it the total energy? I think for high-energy particles, the energy given is the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Because when you're moving at relativistic speeds, the total energy is gamma mcÂ².

So let's get started. First, I need to find the rest mass of the nucleus X, which is Li-6. The mass number A is 6. To find the approximate rest mass, I can use the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively,
