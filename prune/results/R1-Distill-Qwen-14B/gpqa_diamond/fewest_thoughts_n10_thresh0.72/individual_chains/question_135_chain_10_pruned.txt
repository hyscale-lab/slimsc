Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, the exact form might not be crucial right now. The important thing is that X is interacting with fermions. Oh, right, because the boson is coupling to fermions, which means X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, we need to find out which fermion pairs it can decay into, based on their masses. Because for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion's mass must be less than half the mass of X. Because each fermion would take some energy, and the total has to be less than the mass of X.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. What are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think:

Electron (e): mass is about 0.0005 GeV, negligible. So definitely below 3 GeV.

Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV, still way below 3.

Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV. That's less than 3, so tau pairs are possible.

What about the quarks? The up and down are light, like a few MeV each. So up (u) and down (d) quarks have masses way below 3 GeV. Similarly, strange (s) quarks are heavier, but I think about 100 MeV or so. Still way under 3.

Charm (c) quarks have a mass around 1.5 GeV. So 2 times that is 3 GeV, which is exactly the half of X's mass. Wait, but in reality, particles can't decay into particles with mass equal to half the parent mass because you can't have rest mass in that case. Because for two identical particles, each would have to have energy at least their rest mass. So, X's mass is 6 GeV. So if each c quark has a mass m, then 2m must be less than 6 GeV. So m < 3 GeV. Charm is about 1.5, so 2m is 3 GeV. Hmm, but that's exactly the limit. So can X decay into c c-bar? Because 2mc is exactly 3 GeV, which is half of X's mass. I think particles can't decay into pairs where each is exactly half the mass. Because the decay products must have some kinetic energy. So if the sum of their rest masses is exactly equal to the parent's mass, then they can't move, so that's not allowed. So, for
