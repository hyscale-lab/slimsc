Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to find out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and HCl are often used in certain reactions, maybe something like the formation of nitro compounds or diazonium salts. Oh wait, wait! There's this reaction called the Stephen reduction or maybe something else? No, wait, that's not it. Oh right! The formation of a carbonyl group from an alcohol. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the Hock rearrangement or the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. No, not that either.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When you have an alcohol treated with HCl, NaNO2, and maybe some water, it might form a nitronium ion. Or wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Oh! Wait, maybe it's about the formation of a ketone via some kind of oxidation or elimination.

Wait another thought. Oh, I think I remember. When an alcohol is treated with HNO2 (nitrous acid), which is generated from NaNO2 and HCl, it can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. But wait, the starting material must be a certain type of alcohol. For example, in the production of ketones from secondary alcohols. Or perhaps it's the oxidation of a secondary alcohol to a ketone, but I think oxidation usually requires different conditions, like KMnO4 or CrO3.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think when a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2), it can form a nitroso compound, which then might undergo some kind of rearrangement. Oh right! There's theHoffmann elimination or maybe the Cope rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of a carbonyl group via the hydrolysis of an imine or something similar.

Wait, another angle. The products are diketones. So each product has two ketone groups. What kind of starting materials would form diketones when treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water?

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh! I
