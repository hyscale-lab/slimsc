Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the reaction between them should produce the acetate ion and water. Let's see.

The question says we diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I think I should calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Oh wait, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³ and the diluted volume is 40 cm³ because we added 20 cm³ of water.

So the initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. Molarity is 0.05 M, Volume is 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L). So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

After dilution, volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is moles / volume. 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. I need to find two pH values: at 25% titration and at equivalence.

At 25% titration, that means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So let's think about how much NaOH is used.

Moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Since NaOH reacts in a 1:1 ratio with acetic acid (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O), so moles of NaOH needed for 25% titration is also 0.00025 mol.

The volume of NaOH used is moles / concentration. So 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L → 2.5 cm³? Wait, 0.00025 / 0.1 is 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. Wait, no, 0.00025 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 mL. But wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³. So the total volume at 25% is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³? Or, wait, when you mix, the total volume changes, but I think for dilute solutions, we can approximate the volumes as additive.

But maybe I don't need the total volume yet. Let's think about the situation at 25% titration.

In the solution, part of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. So let me think about the species present. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- + Na+ + H2O

So after 25% titration:

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: initial moles × 75% = 0.001 * 0.75 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the volume of the solution is now 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate using the initial concentrations and then use the buffer equation.

Wait another approach: The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. Then, when you add 25% of the required NaOH, which is 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol.

So, in the solution, the moles of CH3COOH will be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of CH3COO^- will be 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So this is a buffer solution. I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa ≈ log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). Let me calculate that.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5). Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

But wait, pKa is -log(ka), so 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is 0.267, so 0.267 -5 → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So in the Henderson equation: pH = 4.733 + log (0.005882 / 0.017647).

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) which is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is approximately 4.26.

So the pH at 25% titration is about 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point?

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³.

So the total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

At equivalence, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water, which will hydrolyze to form a basic solution.

So the concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Now, using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], and since Kb is very small, we can approximate that x is negligible compared to initial concentration.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6 M. Therefore, pOH is -log(3.288e-6).

Calculating log(3.288e-6):

log(3.288) is about 0.517, so log(3.288e-6) is 0.517 -6 = -5.483. So pOH is 5.483. pH is 14 - 5.483 = 8.517, roughly 8.52.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake with the Kb.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10, yes.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb = (x^2) / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x is sqrt(1.081e-11) → around 3.288e-6, correct.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let me compute that. Let's calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 3.288e-6 → log(3.288) is about 0.517. So 0.517 -6 = -5.483. So pOH is 5.483, pH is 14-5.483=8.517.

So approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 4.26; 8.52 → seems to match.

Option D) 4.57; 6.92 → no.

Option B) 3.17; 6.73 → no.

Option C) 4.73;7.00 → no.

Wait, but wait, wait. Did I make a mistake in the equivalence point calculation?

Wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the solution is 0.02 M acetate. So the solution is a solution of a weak base (acetate ion). So the pH should be calculated using the Kb of acetate.

Wait, another approach: the acetate ion is a base, so the pH at equivalence is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate.

But perhaps I should consider that the solution is a sodium acetate solution, which is a salt from a weak acid and strong base. So it's a basic solution. So the pH should be above 7.

Wait, but I calculated about 8.52, which is option A.

But another thought: Did I calculate the Kb properly? Let me recheck.

Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

The acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

So using the approximation:

[OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So pOH is log(3.288e-6) = 5.483, pH = 8.517 → 8.52, as before.

So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52.

But looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that seems correct.

Wait, but in the initial calculation at 25% titration, I got 4.26.

But let me think again about the 25% titration. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the initial dilution differently.

Wait, initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. So 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Then diluted with 20 cm³ (0.02 L) water. So the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At 25% titration, 25% of 0.001 mol is 0.00025 mol NaOH added. So moles of CH3COOH now are 0.00075, and moles of CH3COO^- are 0.00025.

The volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

0.005882 / 0.017647 is approximately 0.33333. Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 → approximately 4.26.

Yes, that's correct.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that at 25% titration, the pH is lower than the pKa, since more acid is present. Wait, the pKa is 4.73. So 4.26 is below that, which makes sense because the solution is still mostly acetic acid, not much acetate. So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: The initial pH after dilution, before titration, would be lower, since the concentration is lower. Let me calculate that for my own understanding.

The initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M CH3COOH. The pH can be calculated using the formula for weak acids:

Ka = [H+][A^-]/[HA]

Assume that x is the [H+], so:

Ka = x² / (0.025 - x) ≈ x² / 0.025.

So x² = Ka * 0.025 = 1.85e-5 * 0.025 = 4.625e-7 → x ≈ 6.80e-4 → pH = -log(6.8e-4) ≈ 3.17.

Ah, so the initial pH is around 3.17. But in the problem, we are adding NaOH, so the pH should increase. So at 25% titration, it's 4.26, which is higher than the initial pH, which makes sense.

So the options say option A is 4.26 and 8.52. That matches. So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

### Step 1: Initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution
The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: pH at 25% titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.25 \times 0.001 \, \text{mol} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\).

### Step 3: pH at the equivalence point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base in water, hydrolyzing according to:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \(K_b\), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases, the hydroxide ion concentration is:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02} \approx \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.483.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.483 = 8.517 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately \(4.26\), and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately \(8.52\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
