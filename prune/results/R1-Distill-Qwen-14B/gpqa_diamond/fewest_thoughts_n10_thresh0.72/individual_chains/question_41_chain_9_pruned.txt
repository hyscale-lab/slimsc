Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in a laboratory. Hmm, I remember that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes. But wait, if the glass itself is moving, does that affect how we perceive the speed of light in it?

The problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by the observer in the lab. The options are given, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, I think I should recall how the speed of light in a medium is calculated. Oh right, the speed v_med in a medium is c divided by the index of refraction n. So normally, v_med = c/n. But that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, right?

But in this case, the glass is moving towards the observer. So how does that affect the observed speed? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. I think this might involve some relativistic considerations, but wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about speeds being
