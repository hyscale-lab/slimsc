Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and its center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, the conductor is larger than the cavity, which makes sense because the cavity has radius r and R is bigger than r.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are greater than R, which means P is definitely outside the conductor.

Wait, actually, the conductor's radius is R, and the point P is outside, so L is bigger than R. But the point's distance from the cavity's center is l. Hmm.

The angle between l and s is theta. Oh right, s is the distance between the centers of the conductor and the cavity. So, the setup involves some geometry here.

I remember that for conductors, the charges reside on the surface. But initially, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. But when a charge is placed inside the cavity, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, how does that work? If you have a conductor with a cavity and you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge opposite to the placed charge. And then the outer surface will have a charge equal in magnitude to the placed charge because the conductor as a whole must be neutral.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral. When you put a positive charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) will have an induced negative charge of -q. Because the charge +q inside the cavity attracts the opposite charge on the conductor's inner surface. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance it out.

So, the conductor now has a charge of +q on its outer surface.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so the electric field
