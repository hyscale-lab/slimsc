Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves planets transiting a star and the maximum orbital period for another planet to also show transit and occultation events. Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits its star, it blocks some of the star's light, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star from our point of view, right?

So, the setup here is that there's a star with a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. There's a first planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit, and its transit impact parameter is 0.2. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's radius. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events.

Wait, I think the key here is about whether the second planet's orbit is such that it can both transit (block the star) and be occulted (hidden behind the star). For both events to occur, the second planet's orbital distance must be such that it can sometimes move in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind it (occultation). But wait, more accurately, for a transit, the planet must pass in front of the star from our point of view. For occultation, the planet must pass behind the star as seen from Earth. These events depend on the orbital configuration relative to our line of sight.

But how do the orbital periods relate to each other? Oh, right, this is about the Hill sphere or maybe orbital resonance. Wait, no, perhaps it's about the orbital periods being such that their orbits are aligned so that the second planet can sometimes pass in front and behind.

Wait, but the question specifies that both planets share the same orbital plane, so their orbits are coplanar. So, their orbital periods determine the relative positions over time.

Wait, but I think the main idea is that for a second planet to both transit and be occulted, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that it can sometimes be in front (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation) the star relative to our viewing angle. For that, the orbital period of the second planet must be longer than the first, but not so much longer that these events don't happen. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the condition for a planet to transit. The impact parameter is the distance (in terms of star radius) from the center of the star that the planet's path takes. The impact parameter (b) is given by b = (a sin i) / R_star, where a is the semi-major axis, i is the inclination angle (which is 90 degrees for a transiting planet, so sin i = 1), and R_star is the radius of the star.

Wait, but for the first planet, we know that the transit occurs with an impact parameter of 0.2. So, for the first planet, its semi-major axis a1 can be found using:

b1 = a1 * sin(i) / R_star

But since it's transiting, i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1.

So, a1 = b1 * R_star.

Wait, R_star is 1.5 solar radii. So, a1 = 0.2 * 1.5 Rsun.

But wait, the first planet's radius is 1 Earth radius, but maybe that doesn't directly matter here. The important thing is its orbital period, which is 3 days. Using Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So, (P^2) / (a^3) is constant for a given star.

The star's mass is probably close to the Sun's since it's not specified, so let's assume it's similar. So, we can write Kepler's third law as P^2 = (4π²/G M) * a^3. But since M is the same for both planets, we can relate their periods and semi-major axes.

So, for the first planet, P1 = 3 days, a1 = 0.2 * 1.5 Rsun.

Wait, but I think I should convert everything into consistent units. Let's use solar radii and days.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to use the version of Kepler's law in astronomical units (AU) and years, but since the periods are in days and star radius in solar radii, perhaps I can find a relation.

Wait,
