Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations involving multiple acids and bases. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are A to D, with various pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out what's happening when these solutions are mixed. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, when they mix, they'll probably neutralize each other to some extent.

Let me outline the steps as I understand them:

1. **Calculate moles of each acid and base.**
2. **Determine which is in excess and how much.**
3. **Find the concentration of the excess species in the final solution.**
4. **Calculate pH based on whether it's acidic or basic.**

Starting with step 1: Moles calculation.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity (M) = moles / liters. So moles = M * liters.
Volume is 0.5 L (500 mL), so moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
Volume is 0.4 L, M=0.2, so moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L, so moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but I should consider that HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate much on its own. But wait, when mixed with a base, the H+ ions will react with OH-.

Wait, so first, the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other. Then, any remaining H+ or OH- will determine the pH, and any excess of acid or base will influence whether the solution is acidic or basic.

Wait, but waitâ€”CH3COOH is an acid, but it's weak. So, when we mix all these together, the strong acid (HCl) will react with the strong base (Ba(OH)2) first. Then, any leftover acid or base will react with the weak acid
