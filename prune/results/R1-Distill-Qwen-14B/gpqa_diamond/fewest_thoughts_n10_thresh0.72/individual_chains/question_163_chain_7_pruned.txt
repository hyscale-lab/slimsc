Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about dissolving iron hydroxide in a strong acid. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we need to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of the acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. So, I'll calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH group is about 17 g/mol (since O is 16 and H is 1). So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, each OH is 17, and there are three of them. So yes, that's correct.

So, 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol gives the number of moles. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Or wait, maybe 0.0009357 or something like that. Let me get more precise. Let me calculate 106.85 multiplied by 0.000936 to see if I get 0.1. Well, 106.85 * 0.000936 is about 0.1 grams, yes.

So, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. When it dissolves in a strong acid, the H+ ions will react with the OH- from Fe(OH)3. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 consumes 3 moles of H+.

So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So that's 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles of H+.

The strong acid is monobasic, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M. So, to find the volume of acid needed, I can use the formula: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). Rearranged, Volume = moles / Molarity.

Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but the options don't have that exactly. Let me check the options again. Option C says 28.05 cm³, and option B is 30.09. So close to 28.08.

Wait, but wait a second. The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 liters. So when we add the acid, the total volume might change a bit, but I think the problem is assuming that the volume of the acid is much smaller than the total solution, so they might be ignoring the change in volume. Or maybe not. Hmm, but the question says, "minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution." So I think we can proceed with the initial calculation, assuming that the acid volume is negligible compared to 100 cm³. So, 28.08 cm³ would be the volume, but let me see the options. Option C is 28.05, option B is about 30. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that more accurately. 106.85 is 55.85 (Fe) + 3*(17) (each OH). So 3 *17 is 51, plus 55.85 gives 106.85.

So 0.1 grams / 106.85 g/mol =
