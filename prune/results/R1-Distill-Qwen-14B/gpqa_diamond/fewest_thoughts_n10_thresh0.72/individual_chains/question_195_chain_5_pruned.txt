Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is that there are two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet (let's call it Planet A) has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. Planet A's orbital period is 3 days. 

The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's radius. This second planet must also exhibit both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits. 

Hmm. So, I remember transit and occultation events involve the planet passing in front of and behind the star from our point of view. For both events to happen, the planet's orbit must be aligned in such a way that it transits the star (so from our view) and also when it's behind the star, it's occulted. 

Wait, but how does the orbital period of the second planet affect whether it can have both events? I think it's about the orbital distance and the timing so that both transits and occultations can occur without either event being missed because the other planet is too far or too close.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more about the orbital period relative to the first planet. If Planet B has a longer orbital period, it would orbit more slowly. For both to transit, their orbital periods must have a ratio that allows them to align periodically. But wait, the question is about the maximum period where both events can occur. 

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Maybe it's about the Hill sphere or orbital stability, but the question doesn't mention anything about stability, just the possibility of both events. 

Wait, another approach: For a planet to transit its star, the orbital plane must be edge-on relative to us. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, which would require that the planet is larger in the sky relative to the star? No, wait, occultation is when the planet moves behind the star, which would happen if the planet is in a position where the star is in front of it from our perspective. But I'm not sure how that affects the orbital period.

Wait, occultation occurs when the planet is behind the star, so the star eclipses the planet. For this to happen, the planet must be in a position where its orbit brings it behind the star. So, the same alignment as transit, but in the opposite direction. So, for both events to happen, the orbital periods must be such that the planets can align in both positions. Hmm, but the problem states that both planets share the same orbital plane, so they have the same inclination.

Wait, the main thing here is that both transits and occultations happen for the second planet. So, how does the period of Planet B relate to that of Planet A?

Wait, maybe it's about the duration of the transit and occultation events. For both to be observable, the orbital speed of Planet B must be such that it can move from one side of the star to the other within the time it's observed. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the planet's orbital period must be longer than the duration of the transit to allow both events.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the transit method. For a planet to transit the star, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the planet's path in front of the star (from our view) is possible. So, the impact parameter is given as 0.2 for Planet A. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star
