Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. From what I've studied, sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond with the movement of pi bonds. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements.

The question has three parts, each involving a reaction under heat and sometimes acid. The options give possible products for each, and I need to match them correctly.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A

Hmm. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a compound where the amine is attached to two methoxy groups. The structure would be N(CH3O)2CH2. But wait, actually, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the amine on carbon 1, which is also connected to two methoxy groups. So that's a geminal dimethoxy group on the amine.

But-3-en-2-ol is another molecule. Its structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no. But-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOH. Wait, no. Let me draw it. The double bond is between C2 and C3 because but-3-en-2-ol. So the molecule is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH2-OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, number the chain. For but-3-en-2-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait, but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's but-2-en-3-ol. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond
