Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. There are four options, all of which are organic compounds with a certain structure. I need to figure out which one matches the given spectroscopic data.

First, looking at the FTIR data. They mentioned a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since it's a broad peak, it's more likely a carboxylic acid because alcohols have broader peaks, but wait, carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches due to the strong hydrogen bonding. So, I'm thinking that the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Also, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a characteristic peak for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Since we already have the O-H from the carboxylic acid, the 1700 peak would correspond to the carbonyl in the acid. So, that makes sense. So the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. That means the structure doesn't have any conjugated double bonds or alkenes. All the hydrogens are in different environments, but not on a double bond.

In the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns. Splitting occurs when neighboring hydrogens cause the signal to split into multiplets. The more neighbors, the higher the order of the splitting.

First, the doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's break that down. A doublet means two peaks, each split into triplets, and then those are each split into quartets. Wait, no, the splitting is hierarchical. So, each splitting happens based on neighboring groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about how many neighboring groups each proton has. Let me think: a quartet is from three neighboring protons (n+1=4, so n=3), a triplet from two, and a doublet from one.

So, a quartet would be caused by three equivalent H's adjacent to a proton. Similarly, a triplet is from two H's, etc.

So the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That seems complicated. Let me think: the splitting is sequential. So, the proton is split by one set of neighboring H's into a doublet, then each of those peaks is split by another set into triplets, and then each of those is split again by another set into quartets.

Wait, that would require three different neighboring groups. But wait, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is due to coupling with two different sets of protons. Like, J coupling from two different groups.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to being next to two different types of protons. For example, if a CH2 is next to a CH and a CH3. Hmm, not sure.

The second signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, maybe the splitting is happening in three steps. But I'm not exactly clear on that. Let's think about common splitting patterns.

In a molecule, each proton's environment depends on adjacent protons. For example, in a CH2 group adjacent to a CH, each proton on the CH2 would couple with the CH group, but also with each other.

Wait, maybe I should look at the structures provided to see which one fits the
