Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let me read it again.

So, there's this barley cultivar that's drought-resistant, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the target gene in all mutants. The changes are in the first exon. We need to find which mutation would eliminate the compound.

Hmm, the question is about how a mutation in the gene would affect the protein. The gene is the coding sequence, so changes here can lead to changes in the protein, potentially altering its function. The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, which I assume is produced by this gene. So, probably, we want to disrupt the gene so it doesn't make the compound anymore.

Looking at the wild type and each mutant:

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
So the first part is the start codon ATG, then some nucleotides.

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild type, the difference is in the fourth, fifth, and sixth positions. Wait, in the first part of the sequence.

Wild type: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Looking at the first 10 or so nucleotides.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA CAA ... 

Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA CAA ... 

Wait, the first difference is in the first TTT in wild, which is TTC in mutant. So, wild at position 4 is T, mutant is C. Let's see:

Wild: positions 1-10: ATG TTT CTC GCT
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT

So, let's break that down. The first part is the start codon (ATG), then next three nucleotides are TTT in wild, making the second codon Phe. In mutant 1, TTC, which is also Phe. So no change in amino acid here.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the first codon is ATG (Met), then the next three are TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

In mutant 1, after ATG, the next three are TTC (Phe), then TAC (Tyr), then GCT (
