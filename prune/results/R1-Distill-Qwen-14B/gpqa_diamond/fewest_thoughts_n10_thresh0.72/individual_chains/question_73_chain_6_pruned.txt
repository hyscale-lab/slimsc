Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. Like, if one object is moving at 0.6c in the same direction as another moving at 0.5c, their relative speed isn't simply 0.1c. Because that's the Galilean addition which doesn't hold at high speeds. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here.

The formula I recall is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If one object is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, then from the perspective of the one moving at u, the other's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Or maybe I'm mixing the formula. Let me get it straight.

Wait, the general formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)) when they're moving in opposite directions. But since they're moving in the same direction, one is catching up to the other. So, the relative speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)), right? Because if u is the speed of the first astronaut, and v is the speed of the second, but wait, no. Wait, actually, which one is the observer and which is the observed?

Hmm, I think the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)) when you're finding the speed of u relative to a frame moving at v. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, maybe I should assign variables properly.

Let me think: astronaut 1 has mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Astronaut 2 has mass 3m, moving at 0.5c. So, from astronaut 1's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 2?

Wait, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab frame. So, in astronaut 1's frame, the lab is moving at -0.6c. So, what's astronaut 2's speed in that frame?

Astronaut 2's speed in the lab frame is 0.5c. So, in astronaut 1's frame, it's (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that would be (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) ) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) )= approximately -0.1428c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c in magnitude, but negative, meaning astronaut 2 is moving at -0.14c in astronaut 1's frame. But since we're taking the relative speed as positive, it's 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Total energy would be the sum of their relativistic energies. Each astronaut's energy is gamma*m*c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for astronaut 1, mass 2m, velocity 0.6c. So gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, v=0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Hmm, sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 1/gamma is about 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options: option C says E=5.96 mc^2 and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc^2 and same relative speed. So the correct E is 5.96, so option C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Calculating E1: 2m * gamma. Gamma for 0.6c is 1.25, so 2 *1.25 = 2.5 mc².
