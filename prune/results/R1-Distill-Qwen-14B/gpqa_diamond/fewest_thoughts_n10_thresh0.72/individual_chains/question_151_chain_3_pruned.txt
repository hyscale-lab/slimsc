Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the outcome 0. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait—is that a column vector with three components? I think so.

So, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, I'm trying to visualize this matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, okay. So P is a 3x3 matrix. Observables are Hermitian matrices, right? I should check if P is Hermitian. To be Hermitian, the matrix should equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real, I just need to check if P equals P^T.

Looking at the elements:

- Element (1,2) is 1/sqrt(2), and element (2,1) is the same. So that's good.
- Element (2,3) is 1/sqrt(2), and element (3,2) is the same. Also good.
- The diagonal elements are 0, so their transposes are the same.

So yes, P is Hermitian. That makes sense because observables are Hermitian.

Now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, is that a column vector? So it's a 3x1 matrix. Let me write it as a column:

ψ = [
-1,
2,
1
]

I think the first step is to normalize this state vector because probabilities depend on the norm. The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the components. Let's calculate that.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state would be ψ_normalized = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify if the state is normalized. Hmm. Since probabilities are calculated using the state vector, I think we need to consider whether it's normalized. But the way the problem is phrased, it just gives the state as (-1,2,1), so perhaps we have to use it as is, even if it's not normalized. Because when you calculate probabilities, you take the modulus squared of the components, but the state must be normalized before measuring. Otherwise, the probabilities wouldn't sum to 1.

Wait, no. Actually, the state vector must have a norm of 1 to represent a valid quantum state. So perhaps the given state isn't normalized, and
