Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction, right? Oh right, because you can't just add or subtract velocities in relativity when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. There's that velocity addition formula from Einstein's theory.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving at u and v relative to the same inertial frame is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). So, here, I think I need to figure out the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other. Let me think: astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So, the relative speed of A as seen from B's frame would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which rounds to about 0.14c. So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Looking at the options, that would be either option C or D. Let me check the options again. Option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D is same v_rel but E=5mc².

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but wait, in this case, since it's the total energy, I think we're just considering the sum of their relativistic energies.

Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m * c². So for the first astronaut, mass 2m moving at 0.6c: gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, no, wait. Gamma is for each individual. So astronaut 1: mass 2m, speed 0.6c: gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1.25 as above. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², approximately 5.96 mc². So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. So option C is a match.

Alternatively, wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate
