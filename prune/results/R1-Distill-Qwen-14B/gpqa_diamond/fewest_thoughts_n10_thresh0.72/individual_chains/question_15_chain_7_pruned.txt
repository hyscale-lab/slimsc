Okay, so I've got this question about transit probability for exoplanets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, orbital period is the time it takes to orbit the star, right? So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period usually means a smaller orbit, according to Kepler's laws.

The host stars have the same radii, but the star hosting Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. Oh, but radius-wise they're the same. I remember that a star's radius affects the chance of a transit because a larger star makes the transit less likely—it’s harder for the planet to block the star's light.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. But the question is about the probability based on other factors like orbital size and star size. Oh right, the formula for the probability of a transit is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but wait, no, I think it's R_planet / a_planet times some function. Wait, I'm probably mixing something up. Let me think again.

I recall that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) squared times some factor, but maybe I should think in terms of the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. Oh wait, the probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight, which is influenced by the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Actually, the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (M_star / m_planet)^2))) ), but wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but for transit probability, what matters is the alignment. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability increases when the planet is closer to the star. Because the star is smaller relative to the planet's orbit. Wait, no, because if
