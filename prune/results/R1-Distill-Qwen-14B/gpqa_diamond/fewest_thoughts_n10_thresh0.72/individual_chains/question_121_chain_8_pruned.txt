Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about reacting a specific epoxide with an organocuprate reagent. The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I remember that when epoxides react with organocuprates like Me2CuLi, it's an example of a conjugate addition or maybe an epoxide ring opening. Wait, no, organocuprates typically do 1,2-additions to carbonyl groups. Oh, right, but wait, epoxides are similar to carbonyl groups in that they're three-membered rings with two adjacent carbons that are electrophilic.

So, the reaction of epoxides with organocuprates... I think it's called the Prilezhaev epoxidation? Or wait, no, that's for making epoxides from alkenes. Hmm. Oh, right, when epoxides react with organocuprates, they undergo ring-opening reactions. The mechanism is that the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon because the more substituted carbon is more hindered, so the organocuprate adds the alkyl group to the less hindered (and usually more substituted) carbon? Wait, no, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says that when saturated epoxides are reacted with organocuprates, the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So, in a disubstituted epoxide, the organocuprate adds to the less substituted carbon. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think: the less hindered would be the less substituted carbon because there's more space there. So the organocuprate (which is a strong nucleophile) would attack the less substituted, less hindered carbon. But then, wait, in the epoxide ring, the two carbons are each connected to two oxygen atoms as part of the ring. So, the more substituted carbon would have more substituents attached, making it more hindered.

Wait, the question also says that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon to which the nucleophile adds. So, when
