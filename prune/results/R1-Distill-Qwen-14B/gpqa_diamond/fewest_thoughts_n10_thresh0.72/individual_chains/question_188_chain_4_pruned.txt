Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, but wait, is that the lattice constant or the interatomic distance? Oh wait, no, wait. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a. But in a rhombohedral structure, which has all sides equal but angles not necessarily 90 degrees, the lattice parameter 'a' is the same for all edges, but the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees here.

The question asks for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl)cos θ}}}

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, for a rhombohedral crystal, the formula is a bit more complex because the angles between the lattice vectors are all the same. The general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2
