Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. So, the data looks pretty perfect on the surface, but there are discrepancies in his results. The question is asking why.

First, let me recall what each part means. In qPCR, the calibration curve is made by running known concentrations and seeing how their Ct values relate. The efficiency is 100%, which implies that each cycle perfectly doubles the target. R² is 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly; no scatter. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I think the formula for the slope in qPCR is related to efficiency. The formula for the slope when you have log vs Ct is (log10(efficiency))^(-1), right? Let me think: efficiency is 100% here, so efficiency is 1.0. Wait, efficiency is usually in decimal, so 100% is 1. So log10(1) is 0. So the slope when efficiency is 1 would be (log10(1))^(-1) which is undefined because log10(1)=0. But wait, no, wait. The formula for the slope is (log10(E))^-1. So if E is 1, the slope is (0)^-1, which is undefined. Hmm, but wait, in practice, a 100% efficient PCR would have a slope of -3.3219... Wait, because another way to think about it is that each 10-fold increase in target is a decrease of 3.32 cycles because of the log scale. So maybe the slope is -3.3219, which is approximately -3.3. So the slope being -3.3 makes sense for 100% efficiency.

Now, looking at the data, the Ct values for each concentration are given with three technical replicates. The Ct values seem to be in a
