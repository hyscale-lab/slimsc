Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

So, the scientist is running a quantitative PCR, which I know is used to quantify the amount of a specific DNA or RNA in a sample. He's making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He did serial dilutions, three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means the PCR is working perfectly, right? The R² is 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly, meaning a good correlation. The slope is -3.3, which I remember is close to the ideal slope of -3.32 if I recall correctly. That comes from the formula involving log and efficiency, I think.

Looking at the results, the Ct values are going down as the copy number goes up. That makes sense because higher starting amounts of DNA should reach the threshold sooner, resulting in lower Ct values. Let me check the Ct values:

At 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
1,000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
100: 24, 24.3, 24.6
10: 20.7,21,21.3

Wait, the Ct values are decreasing by roughly 3 each time when the concentration decreases by a factor of 10. Let me see: from 100,000 to 10,000 is a tenfold dilution. The Ct goes from 33.9 to 30.6, which is a decrease of about 3.3. Then from 10,000 to 1,000, Ct goes from 30.6 to 27.3, again a 3.3 drop. So each tenfold dilution leads to a decrease of about 3.3 cycles. That's exactly what the slope is. Because in the formula for the slope, it's related to the log base 10 of the dilution factor. So if each tenfold dilution (log10(10)=1) gives a Ct change of about 3.3, that's consistent with a perfect qPCR setup.

Now, the question is why there are discrepancies in his results. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But that's not true because he's using it for calibration, which is standard. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with target nucleic acid amounts. But wait, his R² is 1, which means there's perfect correlation. So B seems incorrect. Unless there's something else I'm missing.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, from the data, each ten-fold dilution caused a drop of about 3.3 in Ct. So the dilution is exactly matching the 3.3 cycles. So a ten-fold corresponds to a 3.3 cycle change. So if the slope is -3.3, that's correct. So Option C says the ten-fold is more than 3.3 cycles, but in this case, it's exactly 3.3. So C is not correct.

Option D: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the data, each triplicate has a variation of about 0.3. For example, 33.9,34.2,34.5: the range is 0.6, but the average deviation from the mean is probably around 0.3. Wait, the standard deviation is a measure of how much they vary. But in
