Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given information is that the angular size of its event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. The options are A to D, all in the range of 10^50s or higher.

Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I think is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. So the entropy depends on the area of the event horizon.

Wait, but first, I need to find the radius of the black hole to get the area. The event horizon's radius is given by the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2 G M / c². But I don't have the mass directly. Instead, I have the angular size. So I should probably use some trigonometry to find the size of the event horizon, which would let me find the radius, and then the mass, and finally the entropy.

Let me think. The angular size θ is given in degrees. But for small angles, the approximation θ (in radians) ≈ opposite side / adjacent side holds. So θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius of the event horizon, and d is the distance to the black hole.

Wait, but wait. The distance d is in parsecs, which is a huge unit. I should convert that to meters, maybe, because the standard units for physics formulas are in meters, kilograms, seconds.

So first, let's convert d from parsecs to meters. I remember that 1 parsec is approximately 3.086 × 10^16 meters. So d = 10^10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

But wait, since we're dealing with orders of magnitude, maybe I can approximate 1 parsec as about 3e16 meters, so d ≈ 3e26 meters.

The angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. I need to convert that to radians because the small angle approximation formula (θ ≈ R/d) uses radians.

Conversion from degrees to radians: θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). So 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * π / 180 radians. Let me compute that approximately.

π is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So θ_rad ≈ 1.75e-19 radians.

Using the small angle approximation, θ ≈ R / d → R ≈ θ * d.

So R ≈ 1.75e-19 rad * 3e26 m. Let me calculate that.

1.75e-19 * 3e26 = 5.25e7 meters. So R ≈ 5.25e7 meters.

Wait, that's the Schwarzschild radius. So R_s = 2 G M / c² → M = (R_s c²) / (2 G)

Let me compute M. I can plug in the values for G and c.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

c is 3e8 m/s.

So R_s = 5.25e7 m.

So M = (5.25e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 ) / (2 * 6.67e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Calculate numerator: (5.25e7) * (9e16) = 5.25e7 * 9e16 = 4.725e24.

Denominator: 2 * 6.67e-11 = 1.334e-10.

So M = 4.725e24 / 1.334e-10 ≈ 3.54e34 kg.

Wait, that's the mass of the black hole. Now, the next step is to find the entropy.

The entropy S is (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon, which is 4 π R_s².

So A = 4 π (5.25e7 m)^2.

Calculating A:

5.25e7 squared is (5.25)^2 = 27.56, times 1e14 m² → 27.56e14 = 2.756e15 m².

Multiply by 4 π → 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. So 12.566 * 2.756e15 ≈ 3.465e16 m².

So A ≈ 3.465e16 m².

Now, plug into the entropy formula:

S = (A c³) / (4 ħ G k_B )

Let me write down all the constants:

ħ (hbar) is approximately 1.055e-34 J s.

G is 6.67e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B (Boltzmann's constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Now, let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: A * c³ = 3.465e16 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

Compute (3e8)^3 = 27e24 = 2.7e25 m³/s³.

So 3.465e16 * 2.7e25 = (3.465 * 2.7) e(16+25) = approx 9.35e41 m^5/s³.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

Compute each term:

4 = 4.

ħ = 1.055e-34 J s.

G = 6.67e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K.

Multiplying them together:

4 * 1.055e-34 * 6.67e-11 * 1.38e-23.

First multiply 4 * 1.055e-34 = 4.22e-34.

Multiply by 6.67e-11: 4.22e-34 * 6.67e-11 ≈ 2.82e-44.

Multiply by 1.38e-23: 2.82e-44 * 1.38e-23 ≈ (2.82 *1.38) e-67 ≈ 3.89e-67.

So denominator ≈ 3.89e-67.

So S ≈ (9.35e41) / (3.89e-67) → 9.35e41 / 3.89e-67 = (9.35 / 3.89) e(41 +67) ≈ 2.4e108 J/K.

Wait, that's 2.4e108 J/K, so the order of magnitude is 1e108. But
