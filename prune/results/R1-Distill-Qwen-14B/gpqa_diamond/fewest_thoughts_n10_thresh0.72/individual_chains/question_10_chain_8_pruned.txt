Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question asks which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to one of the four exoplanet scenarios.

Let me break down each option. I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So I need to figure out both the mass and the radius (which helps determine volume) for each planet.

Starting with option a: It's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So its density would be the same as Earth's. I think Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. I remember that from school.

Option b: This planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, density is given directly here. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth. But wait, wait, could that be right? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5. So that's given, so that's straightforward.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition implies same density, right? Because composition affects both mass and radius. So if it's made of the same stuff as Earth, then density is same as Earth. So density is 5.5. But wait, the mass is higher. Since density is mass/volume, if the mass increases but the radius doesn't scale the same way, the density changes. Wait, no—if the composition is same, the density should be same, because density is a function of material composition. So for same composition, density is same as Earth, 5.5. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. If a planet has the same composition as Earth, but is more massive, how does that affect its radius and density? Let me think about Earth's density. If a planet is more massive, but same composition, it would have a larger radius, but the density (mass/volume) would be the same. Because same composition. So the mass increases, but the volume increases proportionally, keeping density the same. So option c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So same reasoning. The radius would be smaller, but the density remains the same as Earth,
