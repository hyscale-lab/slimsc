Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we've got a compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the manufacture of the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, the Hunsdiecker is for breaking down peroxides to make iodides. Oh wait, another reaction comes to mind. Oh right, the Kurz reaction? Or maybe it's the reaction where an alkyne is converted into an iodide. Wait, no, another possibility: when an alkyl chloride, bromide, or iodide is treated with a metal like sodium or something. Or wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used for dehydrohalogenation, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another thought: when an alkyne reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it forms an iodide. Oh right, the reaction of alkynes with HI and red phosphorus produces a vicinal diiodide. But wait, maybe that's when the alkyne is protonated first. Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

So the reaction conditions are Compound X with red phosphorus and HI. I think this is a type of dehydrohalogenation or maybe a substitution. Alternatively, wait, I think the reaction is the hydroiodination of an alkyne. Oh, right! When an alkyne is treated with HI and a catalytic amount of red phosphorus, it undergoes hydroiodination. For terminal alkynes, it adds HI once, and for internal, maybe twice. But wait, for symmetric alkynes, it can add twice. So the product would be a diiodide or an iodoalkane, depending on the starting material.

But wait, let's look at the structure of compound X first. We have IR and NMR data. Let me parse that.

The IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1—that's a broad peak, probably O-H or N-H stretch. But 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and aromatic rings.

Looking at the NMR:

The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10. Also, for carboxylic acids, the O-H is usually broad around 10-12. But in the IR, 1720 cm-1 could be an ester, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But in the NMR, the 10.5 is a broad signal, which is more like a carboxylic acid O-H. Wait, but in the IR, the 1720 could be a carbonyl from an acid, but carboxylic acids typically have a broad peak around 2500-3300 for O-H, but the IR data given is 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak. Wait, the first IR peak is 3400–2500, which is a broad region, possibly an O-H stretch (like in an alcohol or acid) or maybe an N-H. But the 1720 is a strong peak, which is more likely a carbonyl, like an ester or ketone. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, so 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or maybe a ketone.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which suggests a single proton. So maybe it's an aldehyde. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but can be up to 10.5. But aldehyde protons are typically deshielded and appear around 9-10 as a singlet, and the signal is often split into a doublet due to coupling with adjacent protons. But in this case, it's a broad singlet, which makes me think it's an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but the 1720 in IR might be a carbonyl, which would fit a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm-1). So perhaps we have a benzoic acid derivative.

But then, let's look at the rest of the NMR. 

The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest an aromatic ring with substitution. The doublets of 2H each could indicate a para-substituted benzene, like two substituents in the para positions. Wait, wait, no—if it's a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split into a doublet. For example, if the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, then protons in 2 and 6 would be meta to substituent in 1, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with substituents in the 4-position, but wait, looking at the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted ring, but the doublets would be more complex. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, like a substituent in position 4 and another in position 1. Wait, but the two doublets sum up to four protons, so perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, but let's think of a substituent in position 4 and another in position 1. Or maybe it's a substituent in position 4 and another in position 2? No, that would complicate the NMR.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituent is in the para position, but the ring is part of a larger structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a toluene derivative, with substituents in the para position.

Wait, the aromatic signals in the NMR are 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). The downfield peak (8.0) suggests more deshielded protons, which could be next to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. The 7.2 ppm would be more shielded, maybe next to an electron-donating group. So perhaps the benzene ring has two substituents, one at position 4 and another at position 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent at position 4, like a ketone or an ester group, and a substituent at position 1, like an alkoxy group or something else. Hmm.

Looking at the lower field NMR peaks: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be adjacent to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH3 group attached to a CH2. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, maybe part of an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents: one at position 1 and another at position 4. The substituent at position 4 could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. The substituent at position 1 could be a chain. Let me imagine putting a carbonyl group at position 4 (like a para-substituted benzene). Then, maybe the substituent at position 1 is a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group or something similar.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde, but if that's the case, then why the IR has a 1720 cm-1? Aldehydes have a carbonyl around 1720, so that fits. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group attached to the benzene ring. So perhaps it's benzaldehyde with some substituents. But wait, let's see.

Wait, another possibility is that the 10.5 ppm is a carboxylic acid, and the 1720 is from the carbonyl. So the structure could be a benzoic acid derivative. Let's think: benzoic acid has a carbonyl, and the O-H would be around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Then, the substituents on the benzene ring would explain the other NMR signals.

So, if the ring has a substituent at position 4 (like a carbonyl group, making it a para-substituted benzoic acid), and another substituent at position 1, which is an alkyl chain.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH adjacent to oxygen, perhaps, and the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 group next to that. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2 group (like a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 that is itself adjacent to something else). The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group or something else. Or perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Let's imagine the benzene ring is para-substituted with a carbonyl group (like a ketone or acid) and another substituent which is a propyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group attached.

Wait, but looking at the substituent chain, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, maybe as a (CH2)2CH3 group. Hmm. Let's try to build the structure.

The NMR shows:

- The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group, which would be an ethyl group. Wait, no, a triplet at 0.9 is usually the end of an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So perhaps the structure has an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m,1H) might be a CH group between two CH2 groups. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be adjacent to that, perhaps a -CH2-CH2- group.

So putting it together, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, but then the 0.9 ppm would be the end of the propyl chain, but that's a triplet with 3H, which would be consistent with a -CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but the triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. So maybe the group is -CH2CH2CH3, which would make the end CH3 a triplet. But wait, in a propyl group, the end CH3 is attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2, which is attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene-(CH2)2CH3.

Wait, but then the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH group. Hmm, that doesn't fit with a propyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's see: a butyl group could have a structure like -(CH2)3CH3, but the NMR doesn't show a quartet for the second CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, that would complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which we think is a carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is a ketone, ester, or carboxylic acid.

If it's a ketone, then the substituent would be a group like Ar-(CO)-R. But then, how does that fit into the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acyl group attached to the benzene, like an ester. Let's say the structure is benzene with a COOR group attached. But then the NMR would show the ester protons, but there's no integration for that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzyl ketone, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with an ethyl group attached elsewhere. So, benzaldehyde has a CHO group, which would account for the 10.5 ppm peak as the aldehyde proton. Then, the substituents would be a CHO and another group, perhaps an ethyl group in the para position.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The aromatic signals are two doublets, each 2H. So if the substituents are in the para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to the substituents. Let's say substituents are at positions 1 and 4. So the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to the substituent at 1, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the substituent at 4. If substituent at 1 is a CHO group (benzaldehyde), and substituent at 4 is an ethyl group or another group, then the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets.

But wait, if substituent at 4 is an ethyl group, then the protons at positions 3 and 5 would be more deshielded or shielded, depending on the substituent's electron-donating or withdrawing nature.

Wait, but in our case, the aromatic peaks are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each integrating to 2H. So the substituents are likely electron-withdrawing groups, making the adjacent protons more deshielded (higher ppm) and electron-donating groups making them more shielded (lower ppm). So, perhaps one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like -COOH or -CHO) and the other is an electron-donating group (like -OCH3 or -CH2CH3).

Wait, in our case, the substituent at 1 is the aldehyde (CHO), which is electron-withdrawing. Then, the substituent at 4 is perhaps an ethyl group, which is electron-donating. So the aromatic protons adjacent to the aldehyde (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded (higher ppm, around 8.0), and those adjacent to the ethyl group (positions 3 and 5) would be more shielded (lower ppm, around 7.2). That makes sense with the NMR data.

So the structure would be p-ethylanisole? No, wait. It would be p-ethylbenzaldehyde? But wait, the substituents would be at positions 1 (CHO) and 4 (CH2CH2CH3)? No, wait, the substituent in position 4 would be a longer chain based on the NMR.

Wait, let me think again. The substituent in position 4 (or wherever) could be an ethyl group, but in our NMR, we have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is typical for a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps that's the substituent.

But then, the substituent in position 1 is the CHO group. So the structure would be benzaldehyde with an ethyl group in the para position.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the other signals (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, etc.) don't fit an ethyl group. Wait, because the ethyl group would have a triplet at 1.3 ppm (for the CH2 next to the benzene) and a triplet at 0.9 ppm (for the terminal CH3). But in our NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which doesn't fit the ethyl group.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is longer. Let's think about a propyl group. The CH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet at 0.9, and the middle CH2 would be a quartet around 1.6 ppm. But in our NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which might fit that, and the 1.4 is a doublet, which is more complex. Maybe it's an isopropyl group.

Wait, an isopropyl group would have a CH(CH3)2. The central CH would have a triplet, but the CH3 groups would be a septet. Hmm, but in our NMR, the 1.4 is a doublet (3H), which fits a CH3 attached to a CH2. So perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the structure would be benzene with a substituent like that. Let's see: in that case, the CH(CH2CH3) would have a CH group, which would show up as a multiplet. The adjacent CH2 would have protons that could be split into a quartet or multiplet.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group attached to a CH2, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact substituent.

Let me try to reconstruct the possible structure based on the NMR:

The aromatic ring has two substituents, one at position 1 and another at position 4. The substituent at position 1 is a CHO group (so, benzaldehyde). The substituent at position 4 is a longer chain, perhaps an isobutyl group or something similar.

The chain's structure could be: the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Let me think of the chain as CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that's more like an isopropyl group, but perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent might be a propyl group attached to the benzene ring. So, benzene-(CH2)2CH3. But then, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH3 at 0.9 ppm, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet around 1.6 ppm, and the next CH2 would be a triplet around 2.5 ppm. Hmm, but our NMR doesn't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the signals at 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H), and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) could correspond to a propyl chain attached via a CH group. So, something like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-C(H)(something). Hmm, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a pentyl group, but I don't think so because the NMR doesn't show enough splitting for that.

An alternative idea: perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached to a CH group. So, for example, the substituent is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't fit the NMR either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)2. Wait, but that would give a CH group with adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, let me think about the substituent structure. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) indicates a terminal CH3 group, which is part of a longer chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 group attached to that CH. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH attached to both the CH3 and the CH2.

Putting that together, the substituent could be a CH(CH2CH2CH3)(CH3) group. So, the structure would be benzene with a substituent like CH(CH2CH2CH3)(CH3). Wait, that's a neopentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a benzyl group connected to a carbonyl and a chain. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like 4-(propyl)benzaldehyde. Then, the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, and the aldehyde is in the para position. But let's see the NMR of that.

In that case, the aldehyde proton would be at 10.5 ppm as a singlet (but wait, aldehyde protons are usually split into a doublet because they're adjacent to the CH group). Hmm, but in the NMR here, the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which might not fit an aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would be benzoic acid with substituents. So, the substituent would be a chain attached to the benzene ring in the para position. For example, the structure would be 4-(some chain)benzoic acid.

So, the substituent would be a chain like -CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, but looking back, the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), which is a CH3 attached to a CH2, perhaps. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 group attached to that CH3, and the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) would be a CH group attached to the CH2 and perhaps another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group. A secondary butyl group would be CH(CH2CH2CH3)2. But that would give a CH group with two adjacent CH2 groups. Hmm, but the NMR shows a 1H in the 2.9 ppm region, which could be that CH.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. The protons on the CH(CH3)2 would be a multiplet, but the CH2 attached to the benzene would be a quartet. But in our case, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which could correspond to a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

Wait, perhaps the structure of the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. But that would require more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that might be overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a CH group, which is itself attached to the benzene. So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)-. Then, the NMR would show the CH3 at 1.4 ppm as a doublet (since it's attached to a CH), the CH2 at 1.7 ppm as a multiplet, and the CH at 2.9 ppm.

Putting it all together, the substituent would be a propyl group attached via a CH group, making it a secondary carbon. So, the structure would be benzene with a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid or ketone) and a substituent like CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3. Wait, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)2 group, making it a tertiary butyl group. Then, the substituent would be a tert-butyl group attached to the benzene, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's a neopentyl group. Wait, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, perhaps I'm getting the terminology wrong. The structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, making it a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a benzene ring, and the chain is -(CH2)3CH3. Then, the NMR would show the CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t), the middle CH2 at 1.6 ppm (quartet), and the CH2 adjacent to the benzene at 2.6 ppm (triplet). But in our data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H, which could fit a CH adjacent to two CH2 groups.

Hmm, maybe it's a cyclopropane or something, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's imagine it's a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would show:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) for the terminal CH3.
- 1.4 ppm (maybe a quartet for the CH2 adjacent to the terminal CH3)
- 1.7 ppm (maybe a triplet for the next CH2)
- 2.9 ppm (maybe a triplet for the CH2 attached to the benzene)

But in our case, the 1.4 is a doublet (3H), which doesn't fit a butyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3 group, making it a tertiary butyl group. Then, the CH3 groups would be at 1.4 ppm, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Then, the CH3 would be at 1.4 ppm, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Then, the CH3 would be attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the reaction. The reaction is Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. We thought earlier that this is a hydroiodination of an alkyne. So if X is an alkyne, then the product would be an alkyl iodide. But if X has a triple bond, then after reaction, we get a diiodide.

Wait, but let me reconsider. Another possibility is that Compound X is a benzene ring with an alkyne substituent. For example, a benzene ring with a propargyl group. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across the triple bond, converting it into a diiodide.

But then, looking at the NMR, the aromatic signals would be as before, and the alkyne signals would change. Hmm.

Wait, the IR data has 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl. So perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Then, upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, which I'm not exactly sure about, perhaps it would undergo some substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a Fries rearrangement, but that's under different conditions, typically with a metal like AlCl3, and it's for esters.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the leaving group is replaced by iodide. So, if the substituent is a halide, like a bromide or chloride, the reaction would substitute it with iodide.

But looking back, the IR has a peak at 1720, which might not fit a halide group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a nitrile, but the IR for nitrile is around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present here.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of the options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, so the reaction is Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So, the product is one of these options.

Looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, the benzoic acid is at position 2, with a phenyl group at position 4 that's ethyl-substituted.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, toluene derivative with a sec-butyl substituent.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So, a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group.

Wait, but our initial analysis of the NMR and IR suggests the presence of a carbonyl, which is present in options A and C (benzoic acids).

But looking at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, which would be present in benzoic acids (as carboxylic acids have carbonyls around 1700 cm-1, but maybe a bit higher if conjugated).

The NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which would fit a carboxylic acid O-H. So, options A and C are possible.

Now, looking at the substituents in options A and C.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the benzoic acid is at position 4, and the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. Wait, no, the substituent would be at position 4 relative to the COOH group. So, the COOH is at position 1, and the sec-butyl at position 4.

Wait, so the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH.

The NMR would then have the aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H. So, the substituent being a sec-butyl group would affect the aromatic protons.

In the NMR, the aromatic signals are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H), which would make sense if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like COOH) in the para position, making the adjacent (ortho) protons more deshielded (higher ppm), and the meta protons more shielded (lower ppm). So the 8.0 would be the ortho protons (next to COOH), and 7.2 would be the meta protons (next to the substituent at position 4).

Wait, but in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position relative to COOH. So, the structure would be:

COOH at position 1, and sec-butyl at position 4.

Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH), which would be more deshielded (higher ppm, around 8.0), and positions 3 and 5 (meta to COOH, ortho to the substituent), which would be less deshielded, around 7.2 ppm. That fits the NMR data.

Now, looking at the substituent's NMR signals. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's a neopentyl group. No, the sec-butyl group is a four-carbon group where the branching is on the second carbon.

Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's not correct because that would be a pentyl group. Wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think: the butyl groups are:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3
- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)2?

Wait, no, the correct structures are:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3
- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2 (the branching is on the first carbon after the point of attachment)
- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH3)CH2- (but this would be a pentyl group).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

A butyl group can be:

1. n-butyl: -CH2CH2CH2CH3
2. iso-butyl: -CH2CH(CH3)2 (the branching is on the second carbon)
3. sec-butyl: -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- (but this is not possible as a substituent without another substituent)

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, I think I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a secondary butyl group, which is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)2. No, that's a tertiary butyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which would have the structure CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that's a four-carbon substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is an iso-butyl group. Then, the NMR would have a singlet for the two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon. But in our data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group, not a CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH3 would be at the end of a three-carbon chain, attached to a CH, which is attached to the benzene.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH3 at the end (0.9 ppm, triplet)
- The adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (quartet)
- The central CH at 2.9 ppm (multiplet)
- The CH3 attached to the CH (1.4 ppm, doublet)

Wait, that seems to fit. So, the substituent would be a propyl group attached via a CH group, making it something like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

But in option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group, making it a secondary butyl group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but let's proceed.

If option C is correct, then the product after the reaction would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But what's the reaction here?

The reaction is Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative with an alkyne substituent, and the reaction adds HI across the triple bond.

Wait, but if Compound X is a benzene ring with a propargyl group (an alkyne substituent), then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would add HI to the triple bond, converting it into a diiodide.

Wait, but in that case, the product would be a diiodide attached to the benzene. But the options given don't show any diiodides. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For example, if Compound X has a bromide substituent, the reaction with HI would substitute it with iodide. But the options don't show any iodide substituents.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a hydroboration or some addition to a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Michael addition or some conjugate addition, but I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. If the substituent in Compound X is a leaving group like a bromide, then the reaction with HI would replace it with iodide.

But looking at the product options, none of them have iodide substituents. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm. Another possibility: the reaction is the addition of HI to an alkyne, producing a vicinal diiodide. Then, the product would have two iodine atoms adjacent to each other. But the options don't show any diiodides either.

Wait, but the options are for the product after the reaction. So, perhaps Compound X is a benzene ring with an alkyne substituent, and the reaction adds HI to the triple bond, making a diiodide. But again, the options don't have diiodides.

Another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a halogen is replaced by iodide. For example, if Compound X has a substituent like a bromide attached to the benzene ring, then the reaction would replace it with iodide. But the options don't seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the Staudinger reaction, but that's for azides. Alternatively, they can be used to make iodoalkanes from alkynes.

So, if Compound X is an alkyne, the reaction would add two HI molecules across the triple bond, producing a diiodide. But let's see:

R-C≡C-R' + 2 HI → R-CH2-I + I-R' ?

Wait, no, actually, the addition of HI to an alkyne (with red phosphorus as a catalyst) would produce a vicinal diiodide. So, an internal alkyne would become a diiodide, whereas a terminal alkyne would become a monoiodide.

Wait, for a terminal alkyne, the reaction would add one HI, giving an iodoalkane. For an internal alkyne, two HIs would add, giving a diiodide.

But in our case, the product options are all benzene derivatives without any iodide substituents. So perhaps the reaction is not an addition but a substitution.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the cleavage of a triple bond to form a carbonyl group. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester or nitrile group, but the IR doesn't show peaks for those.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the leaving group is part of the substituent. For example, if the substituent is a bromide attached to a benzene ring, the reaction would replace it with iodide.

But looking at the options, none of them have iodide substituents. So perhaps that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the product, then what's the starting material? It would have a substituent that, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, becomes a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a bromide substituent in the para position relative to the COOH group. Then, the reaction with HI would substitute the bromide with iodide. But the product would be 4-iodo-benzoic acid, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an alkyne group that, upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, is converted into a substituent with a longer chain.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think differently. The reaction is likely an addition, perhaps to a triple bond, converting it into a single bond with iodide substituents.

If the starting material has a propargyl group attached to the benzene, then after adding HI, it would become a CH2I group. But that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the hydroiodination of an alkyne to form a trans diiodide. Then, the substituent would have two iodine atoms adjacent to each other. But the options don't show any such structures.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the reaction is a substitution, and the substituent is a halide that's replaced by iodide. But again, the options don't have iodide groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus and HI can sometimes be used for reductions, but I'm not sure in what context.

Wait, another thought: the reaction between red phosphorus and HI is sometimes used to make hydrogen iodide gas, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I can't think of any.

Hmm. Perhaps I should look back at the NMR and IR data to better determine the structure of Compound X.

The IR shows a broad peak in 3400–2500 cm-1, which could be an O-H (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an N-H. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak indicating a carbonyl, likely from a carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are aromatic C=C stretches.

So, the compound is likely a benzoic acid with substituents.

The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm (1H), which would fit a carboxylic acid O-H proton. The aromatic region has two doublets (2H each), indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.

The other NMR signals (2.9, 1.7, 1.4, 0.9) suggest a chain attached to the benzene, perhaps an ethyl group or a longer chain.

Looking at the options, options A and C are benzoic acids. Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have the structure:

- Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

In this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The NMR would then show signals for the substituent.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's an iso-butyl group. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

A sec-butyl group has the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3, but that would be a tertiary butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But that would make it a four-carbon group, which is correct for a butyl group.

In that structure, the substituent would have a CH2 group attached to the benzene, then a CH group attached to two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. That would be an iso-butyl group, not a sec-butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, making it a pentyl group. But that doesn't fit the option.

Wait, option C says 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But that can't be right because it would be a four-carbon group, and the substituent would be a primary group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the NMR of the substituent. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal CH3, which would be the end of a propyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) is a CH2 adjacent to something, and the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH adjacent to both a CH3 and a CH2.

Putting that together, the substituent could be a CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- at position 4. Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene. Then, the NMR would show the CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t), the adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm (m), and the CH at 2.9 ppm (m), along with another CH3 attached to the CH, which would be at 1.4 ppm (d).

This structure would fit the NMR data.

So, the substituent is a propyl group attached via a CH group, making it a secondary carbon. So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

But in option C, it's a sec-butyl group, which would be a four-carbon substituent. So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is an iso-butyl group.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group, which is a secondary butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, which is a propyl group attached to a CH. That would fit the NMR data as follows:

- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)
- The CH2 adjacent to the CH at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- The CH attached to the benzene and the CH2 at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- The CH3 attached to the CH at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)

So, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, which would be a butyl group with a branch.

But in that case, the substituent would be a tertiary butyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is an iso-butyl group. Then, the NMR would show:

- The two CH3 groups attached to the same carbon would be a septet around 1.4 ppm, but that's not what we have. In our data, the 1.4 is a doublet (3H), which suggests a single CH3 attached to a CH.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck on the exact structure, but given the options, option C seems plausible.

Now, considering the reaction. If the starting material is a benzene ring with a propargyl group (an alkyne substituent) and a COOH group in the para position, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond with two iodine atoms. But that would produce a diiodide, which doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the alkyne is converted into an iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydroboration, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone. But that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the alkyne is converted into a single bond with iodide.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have the structure where the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl group is at position 4. The substituent's NMR would show:

- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t)
- The CH2 adjacent to the CH at 1.7 ppm (m)
- The CH attached to the benzene and the CH2 at 2.9 ppm (m)
- The CH3 attached to the CH at 1.4 ppm (d)

Which matches the NMR data.

Therefore, the starting material, Compound X, must have a substituent that, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, becomes a sec-butyl group.

Wait, but how would that happen? Perhaps the starting material has a bromide substituent, and the reaction replaces it with iodide. But that doesn't change the structure, only the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a triple bond in the substituent, and the reaction adds HI across it.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a propargyl group attached to the benzene. Then, adding HI would convert it into a CH2I group.

But that would change the substituent from a propargyl group (-CH2C≡CH) to a CH2I group, which doesn't match the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the triple bond is replaced by an iodide.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the NMR and IR data pointing towards option C.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### IR Analysis:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: A broad peak, likely due to an O-H stretch (carboxylic acid).
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong peak, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a substituted benzene ring.

### NMR Analysis:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, consistent with the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl or aromatic ring.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: A multiplet, likely from a CH₂ group adjacent to a CH.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A doublet, likely from a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, likely from a terminal CH₃ group in an alkyl chain.

### Structural Interpretation:
The IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative with a para-substituted benzene ring. The substituent at the para position is a branched alkyl group, as indicated by the NMR signals:
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to a terminal CH₃ group.
- The **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** corresponds to a CH₂ group adjacent to the CH.
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to a CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** corresponds to the CH group connecting the aromatic ring and the alkyl chain.

This suggests the substituent is a **sec-butyl group**.

### Reaction Analysis:
The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is consistent with hydroiodination, where an alkyne is converted into a vicinal diiodide. However, the product options do not include diiodides, implying the reaction involves substitution or rearrangement. Given the data and the product options, the reaction likely results in the formation of a benzoic acid derivative with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the substituent is an ethyl group, which does not match the NMR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Correct, as it matches the IR and NMR data. The benzoic acid group explains the carbonyl and O-H signals, and the sec-butyl group matches the alkyl chain signals.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as this is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
