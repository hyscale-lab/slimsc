Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. We're asked what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait. Radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and this is modeled by an exponential decay law. I remember that the decay constant is involved here, and the formula is something like N(t) = N0 * e^(-Î»t). But wait, in this case, they're talking about probabilities, not the number of atoms remaining.

So the decay probability given is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes is 32%. That must mean that the probability of it not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%, because 100% minus 32% is 68%. Oh, right, because if there's a 32% chance it decays, then 68% it doesn't.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." I think that refers to the probability that the atom will decay at some point within that time frame. So
