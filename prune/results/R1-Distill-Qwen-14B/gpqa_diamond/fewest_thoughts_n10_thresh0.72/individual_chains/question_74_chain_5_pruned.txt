Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. We're asked what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait. Radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and this is modeled by an exponential decay law. I remember that the decay constant is involved here, and the formula is something like N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt). But wait, in this case, they're talking about probabilities, not the number of atoms remaining.

So the decay probability given is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes is 32%. That must mean that the probability of it not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%, because 100% minus 32% is 68%. Oh, right, because if there's a 32% chance it decays, then 68% it doesn't.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes." I think that refers to the probability that the atom will decay at some point within that time frame. So

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, so the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the initial decay probability was given for 100 minutes. I think this has something to do with the decay law.

I remember that the decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is given by e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So, the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, but in the question, the given probability is 32% (0.32) within 100 minutes. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). I can solve for λ here.

Let me rearrange that. e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logs on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = ( - ln(
