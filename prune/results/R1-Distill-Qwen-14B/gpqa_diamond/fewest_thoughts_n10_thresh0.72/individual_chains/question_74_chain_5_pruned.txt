Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet, we need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, so the total time from the start is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the initial decay probability was given for 100 minutes. I think this has something to do with the decay law.

I remember that the decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is given by e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So, the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, but in the question, the given probability is 32% (0.32) within 100 minutes. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). I can solve for λ here.

Let me rearrange that. e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logs on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = ( - ln(
