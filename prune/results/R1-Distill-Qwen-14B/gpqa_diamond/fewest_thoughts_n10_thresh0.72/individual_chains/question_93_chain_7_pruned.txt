Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the setup is that a scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He's using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in a series and ran qPCR on three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect—so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² is 1, which implies a perfect correlation, meaning the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope is -3.3, which I think is the standard value because I remember that a 100% efficient reaction gives a slope around -3.3 or -3.326. 

Looking at his results, the Ct values are as follows:

- 100,000 copies: Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2, maybe. 
- 10,000 copies: Ct's are 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average around 31.
- 1,000 copies: Ct's are 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Avg 27.6.
- 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Avg 24.3.
- 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Avg 21.

Wait, but how do Ct values relate to the copy numbers? I remember that Ct is inversely proportional to the amount of target. Lower Ct means more copies because the DNA reaches the threshold quicker.

Now, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. What's the issue here? The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. That doesn't make sense because qPCR is used for quantification. So it's probably not A.

Option B: Ct values don't agree with the target amount. But wait, the data seems to follow a clear trend. Each tenfold dilution (i.e., each step is 1/10th the concentration) leads to an increase in Ct by about 3.3 cycles. The slope is -3.3, which aligns with a 100% efficient reaction. So Ct is inversely proportional—so higher copy number leads to lower Ct. So the Ct values are in agreement, so B might not be the right answer.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, in a 100% efficient qPCR, a tenfold dilution would result in a Ct increase of approximately 3.3 cycles. Because each cycle doubles the DNA. So starting from 100,000, each 10x dilution (10,000; 1,000; etc.) would lead to an increase of about 3.3 in Ct. Let's check the data. The difference between 100,000 and 10,000 is 3.3 (34.2 - 31 = 3.2, which is close). Between 10,000 and 1,000, 31 to 27.6 is 3.4. 1,000 to 100: 24.3 - 27.6 is -3.3 (so the Ct goes down by 3.3 when concentration goes up tenfold). Similarly, 100 to 10: 21 -24.3= -3.3. So each tenfold increase in copies decreases Ct by ~3.3, which is correct. So C says tenfold is more than 3.3 cycles. But in reality, it's exactly that. So C isn't explaining a discrepancy.

Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The data seems consistent, but perhaps the options are pointing out something else.

Option D: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Let's look at the technical replicates. Each sample has three Ct values. For 100,000 copies, the Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The differences are 0.3, 0.6. So the maximum deviation is 0.6. Similarly, 10,000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. The differences are 0.3 each (30.9-30.6=0.3, 31.2-30.9=0.3). So the deviation between replicates is 0.3. Another sample, 1,000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Similarly, 0.3 between each. 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Same 0.3 difference. 10 copies: 20.7, 21.0, 21.3. Again, 0.3 each.

So for each replicate, the maximum deviation is 0.3. So the deviation between technical replicates is exactly 0.3. So D says the deviation is more than 0.3. But in reality, the maximum is exactly
