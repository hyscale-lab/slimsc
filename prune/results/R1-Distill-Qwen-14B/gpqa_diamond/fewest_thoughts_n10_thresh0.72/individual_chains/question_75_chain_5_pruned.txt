Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's go through the problem step by step.

The researcher is using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which are commonly used for protein expression because they're easy to transfect and grow. They used Lipofectamine, which is a common reagent for transfecting plasmids into cells. The plasmid was modified to include the coding sequence for GADD45G, and they added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. The HA tag is often used for protein detection, so that should help in purification.

After transfecting and selecting for antibiotic resistance, they couldn't express the protein as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of the construct and noticed something. Let me analyze the DNA sequence provided.

Looking at the sequence, it's written 5' to 3'. The first part is the start codon, which is ATG. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the HA tag is a specific sequence. HA is typically a peptide from the influenza virus, and the coding sequence for the HA epitope is usually something like YPYDVPDYA. Let me check the start of the provided sequence.

The first few codons after ATG are TAC (Y), then CC (Pro?), but wait, how is that possible? Oh wait, wait. Let me see. The HA tag sequence is usually added as a peptide, so the DNA sequence would be the coding strand. So the HA tag's nucleotide sequence is important here.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence is typically: ATG TAC CCC ATC G... because the amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. Let me think: the nucleotide sequence for Y (TAC) followed by P (CC), then another Y (TAC), etc. But in the given DNA sequence, the HA tag is introduced at the N-terminus. So the construct starts with ATG, then the HA sequence.

Wait looking at the provided sequence: starts with ATG TAC C... so ATG is the start codon, then TAC is the first amino acid, which is tyrosine. But the HA tag's first amino acid is Y (TAC), which is correct. So the next codon is CCC (Pro), which is the second codon in the HA tag (since the HA is YPYDVPDYA, so the second amino acid is Pro). So next comes ATG, which is methionine? Wait, no, wait, the third codon after ATG is TAC (Y), then CCA (Pro), then ATG (M) as the next codon. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the HA tag doesn't start with Methionine. Let me think about the HA tag.

The HA epitope is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza
