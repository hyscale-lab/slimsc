Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh right, expectation value, that's like the average value you'd measure if you measured this operator many times on the same state.

Wait, expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, right? So for an operator O, the expectation is the inner product of the state with O acting on the state.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I can probably split this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx, then add them together.

Let me think about each part separately.

First, for σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The expectation value of σz in this state is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, σz has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right? Because σz |↑⟩ = +|↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So the given state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me compute the coefficients first. The coefficient of |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient of |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So the expectation value of σz is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, 10 times the expectation of σz would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for σx. Oh wait, σ
