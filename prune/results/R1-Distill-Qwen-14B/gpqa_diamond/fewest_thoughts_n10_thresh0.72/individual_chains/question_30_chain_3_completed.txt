Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when something emits light, it's because it's releasing energy. But wait, I'm a bit confused about emission and absorption. Oh right, when a substance absorbs light, it's because that light has the right energy to excite the electrons. But in this case, the question says the dye emits light with a certain energy. Oh wait, wait, no, wait: the question says the dye emits light. So emission is when energy is given off, like when an electron drops from a higher energy level to a lower one, right?

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. Oh, right! Because when a material absorbs certain wavelengths, it doesn't emit that color. The complementary color is what it emits. I think. So if something emits green, it's probably because it absorbed the complementary color, which is magenta or something. But wait, I might be mixing things up.

So the emitted light has an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to find out which color that corresponds to. Then, the absorbed color would be the complementary one.

Wait, colors and their energies: I remember the visible spectrum goes from violet (~3 eV) to red (~1.8 eV). Wait, is that right? Because higher energy photons are violet, and lower are red. So 2.3393 eV is somewhere in the middle.

Let me think about the energy levels. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength. But I might not need exact values; probably the question expects me to know the approximate energy ranges for colors.

Wait, let me see: visible light has wavelengths roughly between 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). The energy in eV can be calculated using E (eV) ≈ 1240 / λ (nm). So for example, 400 nm is about 3.1 eV, 500 nm is about 2.48 eV, 600 nm is about 2.07 eV, 700 nm is about 1.77 eV.

So the given energy is 2.3393 eV. Let's calculate the wavelength. λ = 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm. Wait, 530 is in the green range, right? Because green is around 500-570 nm. So the emitted light is green. So the dye emits green, which means it absorbed the complementary color, which would be magenta or something. Wait, but the options given are red, violet, blue, yellow. Hmm, wait, maybe I got this wrong.

Wait, the question is a bit confusing. It says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). So the color it emits is green, but the question is asking what color is absorbed. Or wait, no, the question says, "what color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?" So if the dye emits green, that's because it absorbed the energy that excited it, and then emitted the green. Or wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

In fluorescence, the dye absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light and emits lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. So the absorbed light would be higher energy than 2.3393 eV. Let's see, what's higher? If green is 530 nm, the absorbed photon would have a shorter wavelength, higher energy. So let's calculate that.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because when a molecule absorbs light, the energy of that light must match the energy gap between the molecular orbitals. The energy difference determines the wavelength absorbed. So if the molecule emits at a lower energy (longer wavelength) than the absorbed, that suggests that during fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted.

So the emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon would have higher energy, which is shorter wavelength. What's the color with higher energy than green? Blue is around 450-495 nm, or higher energy. So if emitted is 530 nm (green), the absorbed would be blue or violet.

Wait, but wait, in the case of fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So for example, a substance might absorb UV light (high energy, low wavelength) and emit visible light (lower energy, longer wavelength). But in this case, the question says the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, which is visible (530 nm). So it must have absorbed a photon with higher energy than that. So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet range.

Looking at the options, the options are red, violet, blue, yellow. The absorbed color would be higher energy than 2.3393 eV, which is around 530 nm. So higher energy than green would be blue or violet.

Wait, let me calculate the energy of blue. Let's say blue is around 450 nm. Then E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.756 eV. That's higher than 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon could be blue, but wait, blue is 450-495 nm. Alternatively, violet is about 400-440 nm, so E would be around 2.82-3.1 eV. So 2.3393 is less than that, so if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed either blue or violet.

Wait, but which one? Because the question is about the color absorbed. So the compound absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. So if the emitted is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed must be a higher energy, which is blue or violet.

Looking at the options, option B is violet, option C is blue.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. So I need to figure out which color corresponds to higher energy than 2.3393 eV. Since 2.3393 is about 530 nm (green), the absorbed light must be at a shorter wavelength. Let's see, 530 nm is green. The color with shorter wavelength than green is blue (around 450-495) and violet (400-440). So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than 2.3393 eV.

Which of the options has higher energy than 2.3393 eV? The options are A) red (~1.8-2.0 eV), B) violet (~2.8-3.1 eV), C) blue (~2.5-2.75 eV), D) yellow (~2.07-2.25 eV). So, the absorbed photon must be either violet or blue, as those have higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm. So a photon with higher energy (shorter wavelength) would be absorbed. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than 2.3393 eV. So what's the color that corresponds to higher than 2.3393 eV?

Violet is about 3.1 eV, blue is about 2.5-2.75. 2.3393 is between blue and green. So the absorbed photon would be blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed?

Wait, I think I have this backwards. If the dye emits that energy, that's the energy of the photon emitted. The energy absorbed would be the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state, right? So the absorbed photon's energy equals the energy difference between the states.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy levels. When a molecule absorbs a photon, its electron jumps from a lower energy level to a higher one. The energy of the photon must match the energy difference. Then, when it emits, it drops back down, perhaps through a different transition, emitting a photon with a different energy. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted.

So in this case, the emitted photon has energy 2.3393 eV. Therefore, the absorbed photon would have higher energy than that. So the absorbed color must have higher energy than green; that is, blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

But which one is higher? Let me think: blue is around 2.5 eV (450 nm), violet about 3 eV (400 nm). So the absorbed photon would be either blue or violet.

But how do I determine which one?

Wait, the dye emits green (530 nm). The absorbed photon must have higher energy than that, so it's either blue or violet. The question is, which option among the given choices is the absorbed color. The options are A) red (lower than 2.3393, so no), B) violet (higher than 2.3393), C) blue (higher), D) yellow (lower than 2.3393, since yellow is around 2.25 eV).

So the absorbed color must be either B or C. So which is correct?

I think the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states. So, if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

Wait, but in fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, which corresponds to a shorter wavelength (higher frequency).

So the absorbed photon would be in the blue or violet region. Now, looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

But I don't have enough information to know whether it's blue or violet. So perhaps the question expects me to know that the emitted color is green, which is in the middle of the visible spectrum. The absorbed color would be towards the violet or blue.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the complementary color. If the dye emits green, it absorbs the complementary color, which is magenta. But magenta is not an option. So perhaps that line of thinking isn't helpful.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. The energy absorbed is the energy that caused the transition. So the energy absorbed is the energy difference between two levels. The emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited state and a lower state.

But perhaps the molecule could absorb a higher energy photon than emitted. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, so its wavelength is shorter (blue or violet).

So the question is, which color is absorbed? The absorbed color is the one with higher energy than the emitted. So the options for absorbed color are violet (B) or blue (C). Now, what's the exact energy of blue and violet?

Blue is around 2.5-2.7 eV (for 450-495 nm). Violet is about 3.0 eV (400 nm, E = 1240/400 = 3.1 eV). So 2.3393 is between blue and green.

Wait, if the absorbed energy is higher than 2.3393 eV, then the options would be B or C.

But I don't know the exact energy. However, the question says the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. Now, which color is the absorbed one?

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted light is the same as the absorbed. But no, because when something emits, it's usually at a lower energy than what it absorbed. So I'm back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy of the emitted and absorbed photons. The energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state. The emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited state and a lower state (maybe a triplet state, depending on fluorescence mechanism).

But without more details, I can't calculate the exact energy of the absorbed photon. So perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The emitted photon is about 2.3393 eV, which is green. The absorbed would be higher, so either blue (2.5-2.7) or violet (3.0-3.1). So looking at the options, which one is higher than 2.3393?

Option B is violet (approx 3.1 eV), which is higher. Option C is blue (approx 2.5 eV), which is also higher.

But which one is the case here? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is reversed. The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed energy is 2.3393 eV. But that doesn't make sense because in fluorescence, the absorbed energy is higher.

Wait, no. The energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy. So the absorbed color is of higher energy than 2.3393 eV, which is green.

So the only options that fit are blue and violet.

Wait, the question says the dye "emits" that energy. So, the emission is green. So the absorption must be in a higher energy region, which is blue or violet.

So, the question is which color is absorbed. So the answer is either B or C.

But how to decide? Maybe I should look for an example. Let's think about GFP (green fluorescent protein). GFP absorbs blue light (around 480 nm, which is about 2.58 eV) and emits green (around 510 nm, about 2.43 eV). So in that case, the emitted energy is lower than the absorbed. So the absorbed is blue, emitted is green.

In the current problem, the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed would be blue (2.5ish) or violet (3ish). But in GFP's case, the absorbed is higher than the emitted.

In this example, 2.3393 is the emitted. So the absorbed would be higher, either blue or violet.

So if the absorbed is blue (2.58 eV), which is 480 nm, and emitted is 2.43 eV (510 nm), that's lower.

So perhaps in the current problem, the absorbed is blue, but wait, 2.3393 is lower than 2.58, so the absorbed would have higher energy.

Wait, in the current problem, the emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is lower than GFP's emission. So the absorbed would have to be higher than 2.3393 eV. So in that case, blue is about 2.5 eV, which is higher. So the absorbed would be blue (option C) or violet (option B).

But without knowing the exact energy, I can't be certain. So among the options, which one is higher than 2.3393 eV?

Well, blue is around 2.5 eV, so yes, it's higher. Violet is 3.1 eV, which is higher too. So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But the options are A) Red (no), B) Violet (yes), C) Blue (yes), D) Yellow (no). So the choices are B and C.

Hmm, but I can't choose between them. Maybe I can think about the position of green. Green is in the middle of the visible spectrum. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed would be towards the blue or violet, which are higher energy. But which one is more likely?

Wait, maybe the other way: the emitted color is the complementary color of the absorbed. For example, if something absorbs blue, it emits orange. But that's for dyes, right? Because if a dye absorbs blue, it doesn't emit blue, so the color we see is the remaining colors, which would be orange (complementary to blue). Wait, but in fluorescence, it's a bit different.

Wait, no, because in fluorescence, the emitted photon is lower energy than the absorbed. So the emitted color is not necessarily the complementary. Instead, the color we see is the emitted color.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the question is, the compound emits light at 2.3393 eV. So the compound emits green. Which color is it absorbing? Because the dye appears in the color it emits when it's fluorescent. But in reality, the dye would appear dark unless it's illuminated with the absorbed wavelength.

Wait, no. When you shine light on the dye, it absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. So the color you see when it's lit is the emitted color. But the question is, what color is absorbed? So the absorbed color is the one that triggers the fluorescence. So the dye absorbs light of a certain color (higher energy than emitted), which causes it to emit green.

So the color absorbed is higher energy than the emitted green (2.3393 eV). So that's either blue (higher than 2.3393) or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet (3.1 eV) and C is blue (2.5 eV). Both are higher than 2.3393.

But how to choose between them?

Wait, perhaps the energy of 2.3393 eV is closer to blue or violet.

Wait, 2.3393 is approximately 530 nm, which is green.

So the absorbed energy must be higher than that. Let's calculate for blue:

Blue is around 450 nm: E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.755 eV.

Violet is around 400 nm: E ≈ 3.1 eV.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is in between blue and green.

So the absorbed energy would be either blue (2.755 eV) or violet (3.1 eV). So the absorbed color is either blue or violet.

But the question's options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact energy gap, I can't know for sure. However, perhaps the question expects me to know that 2.3393 eV corresponds to blue emission. Wait, no, 2.3393 is green.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the knowledge that when something emits in the green range, the absorbed is blue or violet. But which one is more likely?

Wait, another angle: the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted is the energy gap. The difference would be E_absorbed - E_emitted.

If the absorbed is blue (2.755 eV), the difference is about 0.4157 eV.

If the absorbed is violet (3.1 eV), the difference is about 0.7607 eV.

Which is more reasonable? Not sure. But perhaps in many dyes, the energy gap isn't that big. So maybe the absorbed is blue.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. The question is, which color is absorbed? The absorbed color has higher energy than emitted (green), so it's either blue or violet. The options are B and C.

Looking at the answer options, the correct absorbed color must be either B or C. But which one?

Wait, maybe I should think about the wavelength of the absorbed photon. The emitted is 530 nm. If the energy difference is small, the absorbed photon could be in the blue, say 450 nm. So E_absorbed would be 1240/450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

E_absorbed - E_emitted = 2.756 - 2.3393 ≈ 0.416 eV. That's about 0.4 eV. Which is a reasonable energy gap.

Another possibility, if the absorbed is violet (400 nm), E_absorbed = 3.1 eV. Then the energy gap is 3.1 - 2.3393 ≈ 0.76 eV. That's a bigger gap. But it's possible.

But without knowing which is correct, I'm stuck. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the problem says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps because the molecules can have longer wavelengths (lower energy) absorbed. Wait, no, more conjugation leads to longer wavelengths (lower energy) being absorbed. Because the energy gap between the molecular orbitals decreases as conjugation increases.

Wait, that's right. The more conjugated the molecule, the lower the energy of the absorbed photon, because the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller. So in this case, the dye has extensive conjugation, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. Wait, but that would mean the absorbed photon is lower in energy than what's emitted. But wait, no, in fluorescence, the absorbed photon is higher energy than emitted.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things. Let me think again.

In conjugated systems, when you add more conjugation (longer chain), the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO decreases. That means the energy of the absorbed photon (which is the energy difference) is lower. So the absorbed photon would have lower energy, meaning longer wavelength.

Wait, but in fluorescence, the emitted photon is lower in energy than the absorbed. So if the dye has extensive conjugation, the energy gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon would be lower in energy (longer wavelength) than the emitted.

Wait, that can't be, because in fluorescence, the absorbed photon must be higher in energy than the emitted. So the energy gap is the difference between the absorbed and emitted.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the energy levels.

The molecule has an initial state (ground state) at a certain energy. It absorbs a photon, which takes it to an excited state (higher energy). Then, it emits a photon when it goes to a lower excited state (like singlet to triplet state), and then possibly back to the ground state.

Wait, but the absorbed photon's energy is the energy difference between ground state and first excited state. The emitted photon's energy is the difference between first excited state and another state (like triplet state). So the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So, the dye with more conjugation has a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. So the energy of the absorbed photon is lower. Hmm, but that would mean that the absorbed photon is of lower energy, which contradicts the fluorescence principle. Wait, no, if the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, then the absorbed photon has lower energy.

Wait, but if the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, the absorbed photon has lower energy. But in fluorescence, the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed. So that's consistent.

So, if the dye has extensive conjugation, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller. So the absorbed photon has lower energy (longer wavelength) than if the conjugation were less.

But in this question, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green). The absorbed photon must be higher than that. But with extensive conjugation, the HOMO-LUMO gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon's energy is lower than it would be without conjugation. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, more conjugation → lower energy of absorbed photon. Because the energy difference between HOMO and LUMO is smaller. So if the molecule has a large HOMO-LUMO gap, it absorbs higher energy (shorter wavelength) light. So with more conjugation, the gap is smaller, so the absorbed photon is lower energy (longer wavelength). But wait, in the case of the dye, the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted.

So if the emitted is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher (shorter wavelength). But with more conjugation, the absorbed wavelength is longer (energy lower), which would be conflicting because it would mean the absorbed is lower than emitted. But that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

In a molecule with more conjugation, the HOMO-LUMO gap decreases. So the energy of the photon absorbed (which is the HOMO-LUMO gap) is lower. So the absorbed photon has lower energy than it would without conjugation.

But in fluorescence, the emitted photon must have lower energy than the absorbed. So if the absorbed photon's energy is lower than without conjugation, but the emitted is lower than absorbed, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is also lower.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just proceed with the given data.

The dye emits green (2.3393 eV). So the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength) than that. So the options are B (violet, higher) and C (blue, higher).

Which color is it? Blue is about 2.5-2.75 eV, which is higher than 2.3393. Violet is higher still.

The question is, which is the correct answer? The options are B and C.

But looking at the answer options: the question asks for the color absorbed. So if the compound emits green, it must be absorbing either blue or violet.

But without more info, it's hard to choose. Perhaps the question expects me to know that the energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to blue emission. Wait, no, 2.3393 is green.

Alternatively, perhaps the absorbed color is blue, and the emitted is green. So the answer would be blue (option C).

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing a different concept. Wait, perhaps the emitted color is the same as the absorbed, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: when a substance emits light, the color we see is the emitted one. The absorbed color is the one it doesn't emit. So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed some other color, which is not green.

But that's not directly helpful; because the absorbed color is the one that causes emission.

Wait, perhaps the question is trying to trick me. The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. The energy that is absorbed is the same as the energy emitted. But that can't be, because in fluorescence, the energy absorbed is higher.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the absorbed color based on the energy gap. But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct approach is to calculate the wavelength of 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green), and the absorbed photon is higher in energy, so blue (450 nm) or violet (400 nm).

But the question is, which one is the correct option. Looking at the options, B is violet, C is blue.

Wait, maybe the energy difference is such that the absorbed is blue. 2.3393 eV is green, and the absorbed is blue (2.5 eV), which is a close match.

Alternatively, I can think of the colors as:

Red: ~1.8-2.0 eV

Orange: ~2.0-2.1 eV

Yellow: ~2.1-2.2 eV

Green: ~2.2-2.4 eV

Blue: ~2.4-2.8 eV

Violet: ~2.8-3.1 eV

Wait, so 2.3393 eV is just above green. So it's in the blue range.

Wait, no. No, 2.3393 is green. Blue is about 2.5 eV. So perhaps if the emitted is green, the absorbed is blue.

Wait, but then the energy of the absorbed would be higher. So the absorbed is blue.

So the answer would be option C) Blue.

But earlier, I thought that in GFP, blue is absorbed and green is emitted. So perhaps the correct answer here is blue.

So, putting it all together, the answer is B or C. But according to GFP's example, blue is absorbed and green emitted. So in this case, the emitted is green, the absorbed is blue.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm, placing it in the green region of the visible spectrum. 

In fluorescence, the energy of the emitted photon is always lower than the energy of the absorbed photon. This means the absorbed photon must have a higher energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted photon. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where \( E \) is the energy, \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength. Using this relationship, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV, corresponding to a wavelength shorter than 530 nm.

The visible spectrum ranges from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Based on the energy levels:

- Violet light corresponds to energies around 3.1 eV (wavelengths ~400 nm).
- Blue light corresponds to energies around 2.5–2.7 eV (wavelengths ~450–495 nm).
- Green light corresponds to energies around 2.2–2.4 eV (wavelengths ~500–570 nm).
- Yellow light corresponds to energies around 2.0–2.2 eV (wavelengths ~570–590 nm).
- Red light corresponds to energies around 1.8–2.0 eV (wavelengths ~620–700 nm).

Since the emitted light is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed light must have a higher energy, corresponding to either blue or violet. Among the options provided:

- **Option A (Red):** Red light has lower energy (~1.8–2.0 eV) and cannot be the absorbed light, as it is lower than the emitted energy.
- **Option B (Violet):** Violet light has higher energy (~3.1 eV) and could be the absorbed light.
- **Option C (Blue):** Blue light has higher energy (~2.5–2.7 eV) and could also be the absorbed light.
- **Option D (Yellow):** Yellow light has lower energy (~2.0–2.2 eV) and cannot be the absorbed light.

Given that the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher. Between violet and blue, blue light (2.5–2.7 eV) is closer in energy to the emitted green light, making it the more likely candidate for the absorbed light. This aligns with examples like green fluorescent protein (GFP), which absorbs blue light and emits green light.

Thus, the color of light absorbed by the organic compound is **blue**.

Answer: C
