Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's a vector d from where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. The velocity at that time tr is v. We're supposed to find the expressions for V and A at time t when t is greater than tr.

Wait, so V is the scalar potential and A is the vector potential. Right, I remember from Maxwell's equations that the potentials are related to the fields via B = ∇×A and E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t. But how does that tie into the moving charge scenario?

Oh, right, when charges are moving, you have to consider their velocity because it creates magnetic fields as well. So the potentials would depend on both the charge's position and velocity. 

The options are A to D. Let me look at each option.

Option A: V is the usual Coulomb potential, which makes sense for the scalar part. The vector potential A is v squared over c squared times V. Hmm, that seems off because the units might not match. Vector potential A has units of (velocity * charge)/(something), but I'm not sure. Also, why v squared? Maybe not.

Option B: V is the same as Coulomb, and A is v over c squared times V. So A has units of velocity (since V is potential, which is energy per charge, so units of volts). Wait, but vector potential A should have units of volts·seconds or something. Let me think: V has units of J/C, so (v, which is m/s) times (J/C) divided by c^2 (m²/s²) would give (J·s/C·m²). Hmm, not sure. Maybe the units are correct, but I'm not certain.

Options C and D involve more complicated expressions with d and v. The denominator is dc minus or plus the dot product of d and v. So d is the vector from where the charge was at time tr to r. So that would be like the displacement. So the denominator is d*c - (d·v). Wait, that would be a scalar because d·v is a scalar. So the denominator has terms with c times a distance (d is a vector, but multiplied by c, a scalar) and a term involving velocity. This is looking more like the Lorentz contraction or something relativistic, perhaps.

Wait, I think when a charge is moving, the potentials are affected by its velocity. The potentials are not just the static Coulomb potentials because the moving charge has a current, which contributes to the magnetic field.

The general expressions for potentials due to a moving charge are given by the Liénard potentials, I think. Let me recall. The scalar potential is the same as Coulomb's law divided by (1 - (v·r')/c² r'), or something like that. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, more precisely, the scalar potential V is given by q/(4πε₀) times (1/(r' - (v·t)/c² + ... )) Hmm, I might need to think in terms of retarded time. Because the fields at a point r are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is the retarded time. So the vector d would be r - s(tr), where s(tr) is the position of the charge at time tr.

But in the expression for potentials, perhaps we have to account for the motion. For the scalar potential, it's similar to Coulomb's law but adjusted for the motion. The vector potential is proportional to the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the standard expressions for potentials due to a moving charge are:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / ( |d| - (v·d)/c² ) ]

Wait
