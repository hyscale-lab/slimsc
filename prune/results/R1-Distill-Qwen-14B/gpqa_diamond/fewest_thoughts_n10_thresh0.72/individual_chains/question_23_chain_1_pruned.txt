Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

The problem states that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. The question is asking which of the given options could be the products.

Hmm. So, first, I need to figure out what reaction is happening here. The starting material is this benzene ring with an ether group attached. The substituent on the oxygen is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw that structure mentally. The butenyl group is four carbons long, with a double bond starting at the third carbon. Wait, but the substituents matter.

Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. That would be benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me break it down. The substituent is a butenyl group. But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is:

O

O-benzene-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no. Wait, but the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? No. Wait, let's number the butenyl group from the oxygen. So substituent is -(O)-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2? No, wait. The butenyl is but-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is:

The butenyl group is four carbons, with the double bond starting at C3. So structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, but wait
