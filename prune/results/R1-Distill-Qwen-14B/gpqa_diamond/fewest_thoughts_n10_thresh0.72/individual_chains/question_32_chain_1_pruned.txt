Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that RHIC collides heavy ions, which are nuclei of heavy atoms. The problem says the nucleus is X, which is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. So, let me figure out what that is. Lithium typically has 3 protons, right? And if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me double-check. The problem states X is Li with 3 neutrons. Natural lithium has isotopes, but the most common is Li-7 (4 neutrons) and Li-6 (3 neutrons). So in this case, X is Li-6. Got it.

Next, I need to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. So the question is about relativistic energy. I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by the gamma factor multiplied by its rest mass energy.

The formula for total energy E is E = gamma * m0 * c², where m0 is the rest mass. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Let me compute gamma. So v = 0.96c. Then v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me do that more accurately. 0.0784's square root: Let me think. 0.28² is 0.0784, correct. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me compute it more precisely. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784: let's see, 0.28 is correct because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

But maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 0.96 divided into the formula.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1 / sqrt(0.0784) = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857 approx.

So that's gamma. Now, what's the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus?

Wait, the rest mass energy of a nucleus is approximately the mass of the nucleus times c squared. But to get that, I need the mass of Li-6. Let me think, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, more accurately, one atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But perhaps I should look up the exact value.

Wait, but for precise calculation, I should probably use the precise value. Alternatively, maybe I can find the mass of Li-6 in terms of u and then convert to kg.

Alternatively, I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be found by the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the binding energy, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the molar mass.

Wait, but maybe for the purpose of this problem, the mass of the Li
