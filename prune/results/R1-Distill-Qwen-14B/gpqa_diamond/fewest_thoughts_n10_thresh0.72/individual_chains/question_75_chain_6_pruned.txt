Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the Chinese hamster ovary cells. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

So, the setup is that they're creating a transgenic mouse model where they overexpress the GADD45G gene, which is induced. They want to look at its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To do this, they've modified the gene's coding sequence to add a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. Then, they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into CHO cells. After selecting the antibiotic-resistant colonies, they tested the expression but couldn't overexpress the protein.

They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and found an issue. The options given are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me think about each step. First, the construct includes a coding sequence with an HA tag at the N-terminus. HA is a common epitope tag used for detection, usually added to the beginning or end of a protein. So the sequence of the construct should start with the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Looking at the provided sequence, it starts with ATG, which is the start codon, Met. Then the next few codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), etc. Wait, that's the beginning of the coding sequence. The HA tag is a specific sequence, typically YPYDVPDYA or something similar. So the first few amino acids should be HA's sequence.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, which is Tyr. HA starts with Tyr, Pro, Tyr, etc. So maybe the HA sequence is correctly incorporated. But wait, the problem states that the HA is introduced at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA sequence followed by GADD45G's coding sequence.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So if they added the HA tag before, the sequence would start with the HA's coding sequence, then the ATG for GADD45G. But here, the sequence starts with ATG. Hmm, that might be the problem. Wait, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is added in frame, so it's part of the same ORF before the ATG. But wait, ATG is the start codon. So if the HA is before, then the start codon for the HA would be before the ATG of GADD45G? No, that's not possible because the HA would be part of the same open reading frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is added after the ATG. So the construct would have HA coding sequence but after the start codon. But that would mean the HA is part of the same protein. Wait, that's not possible because the HA is added at the N-terminus, which would be before the start codon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the HA is added as a sequence at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the coding sequence would start with the HA sequence, then the start codon (ATG) for GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the starting is ATG. So perhaps the HA was not correctly added before the ATG.

Wait, no, the question says they introduced the sequence for the HA determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the HA coding sequence would be before the ATG of GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is the start. So that suggests that the HA sequence is missing, or perhaps not included upstream. So maybe the plasmid was constructed incorrectly, and the HA sequence is not present. But why would that cause the lack of expression?

Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence was added in a way that causes a frame shift or a premature stop codon. Let me look at the given sequence.

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC... So the first few codons are Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Phe, etc.

Wait, the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. So the corresponding DNA would be TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTA (Val), CCT (Pro), TTA (Leu), GGT (Gly), TTA (Leu), GAA (Glu), ATT (Ile), TTA (Leu), etc. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact HA tag sequence. Let me think. Oh, wait, the HA tag is often derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus, and a common version is HA1. The HA1 epitope is YPYDVPDYA. So the amino acid sequence is Y P Y D V P D Y A.

Translating that into DNA (nucleotide sequence), considering it's the coding (sense) strand, each codon is:

Y: TAC
P: CCA or CCG (depends on the organism)
Y: TAC
D: GAT or GAA (depends on codon usage)
V: GTA
P: CCA or CCG
D: GAT or GAA
Y: TAC
A: GCT, GCA, etc.

So the DNA sequence for YPYDVPDYA would be TAC C[CA or CG] TAC [GAT or GAA] GTA C[CA or CG] [GAT or GAA] TAC [GCT or GCA or etc.].

But looking at the given sequence, the first few codons are TAC, CCC, TAC, CGA, TGT, TCC, etc. Wait, the third codon is TAC, which is Tyr. The first codon is ATG (Met), then TAC (Tyr), so maybe the HA sequence should be before the ATG. If the HA sequence isn't there, then the construct would start with ATG, making the HA tag not present. But wait, the problem states that they introduced the HA sequence into the coding sequence. So the plasmid should have the HA coding before the ATG.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, which suggests that the HA sequence isn't present. So maybe the plasmid was constructed incorrectly, and the HA sequence isn't in the construct. But that might not prevent expression, unless the HA sequence was needed for purification.

Wait, but the reason the protein isn't overexpressed could be due to a premature stop codon or a frame shift. Let's look through the sequence for any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).

Looking at the given sequence:

It starts with ATG (Met), then TAC (Tyr), CCC (Pro), TAC (Tyr), CGA (Arg), TGT (Cys), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), CAA (Gln), ATG (Met), ACT (Thr), CTG (Leu), GAA (Glu), GAA (Glu), TCC (Ser), GCG (Ala), GCC (Ala), AGG (Arg), etc.

Wait, I'll go through each codon step by step.

1. ATG - Met (start)
2. TAC - Tyr
3. CCC - Pro
4. TAC - Tyr
5. CGA - Arg
6. TGT - Cys
7. TCC - Ser
8. AGA - Arg
9. TTA - Leu
10. CGC - Arg
11. CAA - Gln
12. ATG - Met
13. ACT - Thr
14. CTG - Leu
15. GAA - Glu
16. GAA - Glu
17. TCC - Ser
18. GCG - Ala
19. GCC - Ala
20. AGG - Arg
21. CGG - Arg
22. GAC - Asp
23. ACA - Thr
24. CTG - Leu
25. CGG - Arg
26. AGT - Ser (but wait, AGT is Ser, but in the plus strand, it's AGT? Or wait, the sequence is 5' to 3', so when written as given, the codons are read in triplets from the start.

Wait, perhaps I should look for in-frame stop codons. Let me scan the sequence.
