Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, okay, so I remember that angular momentum in quantum mechanics is represented by matrices, and these operators have eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The problem states that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I think S is the Pauli Y-matrix. Wait, no, the Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Oh yeah, the Y Pauli matrix is [0, -i; i, 0], right? So S here must be the sigma_y matrix.

So, the operator Ay is c times sigma_y. Since c is h/(4π), we can write Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. 

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - aI) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. Let's set up the matrix Ay - aI.

So, Ay is (h/(4π)) times the sigma_y matrix. Let me compute that. Multiply each element by c = h/(4π):

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π)) ],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

So, the matrix is:

[ 0, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), 0 ]

So, the characteristic equation is determinant of [ [ -a, -i h/(4π) ], [i h/(4π), -a ] ] equals zero. 

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (-i * i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) ]

Wait, let me compute that term. The product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i h/(4π))*(i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²). 

But (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - [ (h²)/(16 π²) ) ] *1 = 0.

So, the equation is a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π). 

Wait, but wait, I thought the eigenvalues for sigma_y would be ±1, since Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. Then, when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues should be c * (±1). So, c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues would be ± h/(4π). That makes sense with what I just calculated.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). So they are real numbers, right, no imaginary parts. Because the determinant calculation gave real eigenvalues. 

Wait, looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or something, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real. So options A and B have imaginary parts, which would not be correct.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Hmm. Well, I remember that A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. In quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum J² commutes with any component of J (like Jx, Jy, Jz), so their eigenfunctions are the same. Wait, but in this case, Ay is a component of the angular momentum, so if a state is
