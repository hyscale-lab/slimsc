Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude B. The average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. The question is about the oscillation frequency of this average.

Hmm, I remember that the magnetic moment mu interacts with a magnetic field, so the Hamiltonian for that interaction is given by the dot product of mu and B. So when the field is along +Z, the Hamiltonian would be proportional to Sz. But when the field changes direction, the Hamiltonian changes too.

Wait, when the field is turned off in Z and on in Y, the magnetic moment's interaction will switch from depending on Sz to depending on Sy. So the Hamiltonian after the change is probably proportional to Sy, right? Because the field is now along Y.

I think the energy levels of a spin-1/2 particle depend on the direction of the magnetic field. When the field is along Z, the energy levels are E = ±(gamma * B / 2). But when the field is along Y, the energy levels would still be ± (gamma * B / 2) because the magnitude of B is the same. But wait, the actual form of the Hamiltonian changes, which affects the time evolution of the state.

The initial state is the spin aligned with the magnetic field along Z. So the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +1/2 (since spin-1/2, so Sz = ħ/2 * sigma_z). Let's think in terms of eigenstates. When the magnetic field is along Z, the state is |+z>, which is (1, 0) in the Sz basis.

But when the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. Sy is (ħ/2) times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. So the eigenstates of Sy would be different. The eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

So the state of the system before the field change is |+z>. After the field change, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Therefore, the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in observable quantities.

The question is about the average of the z-component of the magnetic moment, which is related to the expectation value of Sz. The magnetic moment mu is gamma * Sz, so the average of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of Sz.

Since the state is evolving with time, the expectation value of Sz will oscillate with some frequency. I need to find that frequency.

I recall that in such cases, the oscillation frequency is related to the energy difference between the states involved. So, when the system is in a superposition of energy eigenstates, the time evolution will lead to beats at the frequency corresponding to the energy difference divided by Planck's constant.

Wait, actually, the time dependence comes from the phases of the eigenstates. For a state that's a superposition of two eigenstates with energies E1 and E2, the time evolution leads to oscillations at a frequency proportional to (E2 - E1)/ħ.

In the initial situation, after the field is turned to Y, the Hamiltonian is H = gamma * B * Sy. So the eigenvalues of H are gamma*B*(ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of Sy. The eigenvalues of Sy are ±1/2 * ħ. Wait, no, Sy is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So the eigenvalues of Sy are ±ħ/2. So E = gamma * B * (ħ/2) * (±1).

Wait, no, let me think again. The magnetic moment mu is gamma * S. So the energy is U =
