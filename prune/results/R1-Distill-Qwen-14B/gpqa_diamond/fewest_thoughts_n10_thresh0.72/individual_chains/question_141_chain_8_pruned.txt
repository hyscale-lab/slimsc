Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to identify what the starting material is. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, right, benzene rings with substituents are often numbered based on the substituents' positions. So 1-bromo-2-d... wait, the "d" probably stands for something. Oh, wait, sometimes in such questions, the substituents are numbered with letters, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Hmm, no, perhaps the "d" is a typo. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. Or wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-aminobenzene? Because sometimes "d" is used to denote a substituent, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-nitrobenzene. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm. Maybe I should focus on the reaction conditions instead.

The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it can be used for dehydrohalogenation
