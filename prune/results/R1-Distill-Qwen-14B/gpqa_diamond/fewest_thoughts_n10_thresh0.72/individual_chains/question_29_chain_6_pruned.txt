Alright, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some mutations caused by EMS. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Okay, the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They've done some mutagenesis with EMS and are looking at the target gene sequences.

The question is asking which mutation will eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think that means we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably a loss-of-function mutation. So, the idea is that the mutant gene doesn't produce the compound anymore.

Looking at the given sequences:

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing to the intact, I see that the third and fourth nucleotides are changed. Original is TTT, mutant is TCT. So positions 3-4: T->C, maybe a point mutation. Then, I notice the sequence after that, like at position 7-9 in the original: CGC, in mutant 1 it's CAC? Wait, let me count the letters.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for where the changes are. Let me line them up:

Intact: A-T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G...
Mutant 1: A-T G T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G...

So in the first part, the third T is changed to C (ATGTTT to ATGTTCT... no, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look again.

Wait, the entire first part:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

So the third T is changed to C in the third position. So the first six nucleotides in the intact gene are ATGTTT. In mutant 1, it's ATGTTCT? No, wait, the first part is ATGTTT vs. ATGTTCT? Wait, perhaps I should write the sequences as they are.

Wait, the intact is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…T
