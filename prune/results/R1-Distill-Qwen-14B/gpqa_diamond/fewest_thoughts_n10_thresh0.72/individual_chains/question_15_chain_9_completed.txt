Okay, so I've got this question here about astronomers trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets. They have limited time, so they need to choose which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, right, the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the planet's orbit and the size of the star, I think.

The question says both planets have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right? Because of Kepler's third law. Oh wait, yes, the period depends on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. So a shorter period means a smaller a (semi-major axis).

The host stars have the same radii, but the star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as that of Planet_2. Wait, but stars with higher mass are usually larger, but here both have the same radius. That's interesting. So the host of Planet_1 is more massive but same size as Planet_2's host. Hmm, that's something to note.

The probability of a transit happening is given by the formula (R_star + R_planet) / a, but I think for Earth-like planets, the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, so sometimes it's approximated as (R_star) / a multiplied by something. Wait, no, the probability formula is actually (R_star / a) * (something), or maybe it's (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (1 / something else? Wait, I think the correct formula is (R_star / a) * (something else, maybe 1 over the impact parameter or something else? Wait, maybe the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by the solid angle or something, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a transit is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by ( (R_star + R_planet) / a ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the geometric probability of a transit is (R_star / a), because the planet's orbital plane must be aligned within a certain angle. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

The transit probability depends on the relative size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. The probability is approximately (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis. But actually, the exact formula for the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star / a. Wait, but wait, another factor is the inclination of the orbit. For the transit to happen, the orbit must be edge-on. The probability of that is given by (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is just right. Oh, wait, no, the transit probability is the same as the chance that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. So for a circular orbit, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (something else?)).

Wait, maybe the transit probability is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (something else like the orbital distance factor)). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So P = (R_star) / (a).

But wait, that can't be the whole story because another consideration is the observer's point of view and the star's size relative to the planet's orbit. So if the semi-major axis is bigger, the probability is lower.

Wait, the formula I remember is: the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 - e²))), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), this factor is 1. So the probability simplifies to R_star / a.

Wait, so the transit probability is (R_star / a) * (some factor depending on the orientation). Oh wait, no, actually, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by a factor that accounts for the angle. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (R_star / a) * (1 / (something else)).

Alternatively, I think the probability is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by the ratio of the orbital velocity perpendicular to our line of sight. Hmm, that might complicate things. But perhaps in this problem, since both stars have the same radius, and the planets have the same mass, we can focus on the a (semi-major axis) and the star's radius.

Wait, but the host stars have the same radius. So R_star for both is the same.

So, the transit probability is (R_star / a), right? Because higher a (i.e., larger orbit) leads to lower probability.

Wait, so if a is larger, the planet is farther from the star, so the chance it blocks our view is lower.

So for Planet_1, with a shorter period, it's closer to its star, so a is smaller. So R_star / a is larger, meaning a higher probability.

So which planet has a smaller a?

Because Planet_1's period is shorter (three times shorter) than Planet_2's, which implies a smaller a, because a is related to the period via Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says (P^2) / (a^3) = 4π²/(G(M+m)), but since M >> m (planet's mass is negligible), it's approximately P² = (4π² G M)⁻¹ a³. So a³ is proportional to P² M.

Wait, more accurately, the formula is a³ = (G(M + m) P²)/(4π²). Since M >> m, it's a³ ≈ (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1, M1 = 2 M2 (since the host is twice as massive as Planet_2's host). So M1 = 2 M2.

The period of Planet_1 (P1) is P2 /3.

So a1 / a2 = [ (M1 * P1²) / (M2 * P2²) ) ]^(1/3)

Substituting M1 = 2 M2, P1= P2/3.

So (2 * (P2/3)^2) / (1 * P2^2) ) = (2 * (P2²/9)) / (P2²) ) = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So a1 / a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2.

Thus, a1 is smaller than a2.

So the transit probability P is R_star / a. Since R_star is the same for both, and a1 is smaller, R_star/a1 is larger than R_star/a2.

So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

But let's compute the exact probability ratio.

P1 / P2 = (R_star/a1) / (R_star/a2) ) = a2 / a1.

From earlier, a1 is 0.606 a2. So a2/a1 is approximately 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

Wait, but wait, the transit probability is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (sqrt(1 + (R_planet/R_star)^2) )) ) or something? No, I think that's the depth of the transit, not the probability. The probability is just (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is correct. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the star (π R_star²) divided by the area of the sphere (4π a²) times a factor because it's a 2D cross-section. Or perhaps the probability is (R_star / a) * (1/(something)).

Wait, I think I've read that the probability that a planet transits is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but in this case, e=0. So it's (R_star + R_planet)/a. Since R_planet << R_star, it's approximately R_star/a.

So with that, the probability for each planet is P1 = R_star / a1, P2 = R_star/a2.

Since a1 is smaller than a2, P1 is larger than P2.

So P1 / P2 = a2 / a1.

Earlier, we found a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

But looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says ~2.7 times.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of a1 and a2. Let me recheck.

From Kepler's third law, a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1, M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So a1^3 = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4π²)  ... but wait no, the formula is a1^3 = (G M1 P1²)/(4π²), a2^3 = (G M2 P2²)/(4π²). So to find a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ (M1 P1²) / (M2 P2²) ) ]^(1/3)

M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2/3.

So M1/M2 = 2, P1²/P2² = (1/3)^2 = 1/9.

So (2 * 1/9 ) = 2/9.

So (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of 0.2222 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

Thus, a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2.

So P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) ) = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So Planet_1's transit probability is about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.

So the researchers would choose Planet_1. So looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but I thought the probability was (R/(a)) and since R is same for both, and a1 is smaller, P1 is higher.

But let me make sure about the formula again. Is the transit probability P = (R_star / a) * (R_star / a) multiplied by some other factor? Or perhaps I mixed up the formula.

Another way: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the orbit's cross-section. Wait, that would be (π R_star²) / (π a²) ) = (R_star/a)². But that can't be right because if a is 10 R_star, the probability would be 1/100, which is 1%, which seems too low.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The correct formula for the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by the ratio of the semi-major axis to the distance from the observer. Wait, no, that seems off.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the fraction of the orbit where the planet is in front of the star from our perspective. Since the orbit is circular, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by the fraction of the orbit where the planet is within the cone of our line of sight. So the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (something else?)).

Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So P = (2 R_star) / (2 a) ) = R_star / a. Because the planet must pass within the star's disk, which has a diameter of 2 R_star. The planet's path is a circle with diameter 2 a (from our perspective), so the area where a transit can occur is a chord. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis.

So yes, P ≈ R_star / a.

So with that, since a1 is smaller, P1 is larger.

So the ratio is 1.65 times higher for Planet_1.

Looking back at the options, option C is "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit." That's correct.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}
\]

where \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\(R_{\text{star}}\)), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis (\(a\)) of the planet's orbit. A smaller \(a\) (closer orbit) results in a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis Relationship
From Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis (\(a\)) is related to the orbital period (\(P\)) and the mass of the host star (\(M_{\text{star}}\)) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \(M_1 = 2M_2\) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

Substituting these values into the relationship for \(a\):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet_1's orbit is smaller than Planet_2's.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to the semi-major axis (\(P \propto \frac{1}{a}\)). Therefore, the ratio of the transit probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Given the higher transit probability of Planet_1, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1. The correct option is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
