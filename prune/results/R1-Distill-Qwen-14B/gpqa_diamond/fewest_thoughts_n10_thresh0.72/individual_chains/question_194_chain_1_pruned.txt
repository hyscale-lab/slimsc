Okay, so I've got this problem about spins and the partition function. Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), where beta is 1/(kT). Right, but wait, in this case, the energy is given as E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. So each term is the product of two spins. 

Each spin can be +1 or -1. So each S_i can be +1 or -1. And there are three spins, so the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Wait, but some states might have the same energy, so I can group them by their energies.

Let me think: for each state, I need to compute E. Let's write down all possible states and calculate their energies. But that might take a while, but since there are only 8 cases, maybe manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the possible values of each S_i S_j term. Since each spin is ±1, the product S_i S_j is also ±1. So each term S_i S_j can be +1 or -1.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be... let's see. Each term is ±1. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Wait, adding three ±1 terms.

Wait, for three terms, the maximum sum is 3 (all +1), and the minimum is -3 (all -1). But wait, can the sum take every odd integer between? Let me think: 3, +1, -1, -3. So possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me see: 3, 1, -1, -3 are the possible sums. Because, for example, all three terms being +1 gives sum 3. Two terms +1 and one -1 gives sum 1. Two -1 and one +1 gives sum -1. All three -1 gives sum -3.

So the total energy E is -J times this sum. So E can be -3J, -J, +J, +3J.

Now, I need to find how many states correspond to each possible sum value.

Let me list all 8 possible states. Each spin is either +1 or -1.

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of +1 spins. Wait, but no, because the energy depends on the products of pairs. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, think about the possible values for the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me calculate for each possible state:

But wait, maybe it's easier to note that the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is equal to (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 +
