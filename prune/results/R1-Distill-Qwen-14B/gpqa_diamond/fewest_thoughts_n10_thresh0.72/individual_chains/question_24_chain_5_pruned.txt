Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The problem talks about two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes some reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. 

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, and it's a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. Additionally, mixture X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds.

Hmm, let me start by thinking about what kind of reactions are happening here. The initial mixture X, when treated with Pt and heat, undergoes disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation means a single substance is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids, and Y is also a mixture of two. So perhaps each component of X undergoes a disproportionation reaction?

Wait, but X is a mixture of two, so when each is treated, maybe each undergoes a reaction. But since Y is formed from X, maybe each component of X is converted into two substances in Y. But since Y has two liquids, perhaps each of the two components in X becomes one component each in Y.

Wait, maybe I should think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give the same product Z. So, perhaps the hydrogenation of each component in X and Y leads to Z.

Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7 of the molecule. So, the rest is carbon, which would be about 85.72%.

Assuming Z is a hydrocarbon, so it's CnHm.

The mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) = 1/7.

So, 1/(12n + m) = (1/7) * (m) → Wait, let me write it correctly. (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 14.28/100 = 1/7.

So:

m / (12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So, the formula of Z is CnH2n. That suggests it's an alkene or maybe an alkyne, but wait, when Z is formed via hydrogenation, then Z must be the fully hydrogenated product. Hmm, unless the starting materials were triple bonds or something more unsaturated.

Wait, but Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which suggests it's a saturated compound. So, Z is an alkane? But CnH2n can't be an alkane unless n=1 (methane), because alkanes are CnH2
