Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that two compounds A and B are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. The result is two different diketones. I need to find out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are often used in certain reactions. Oh wait, I think this is related to the formation of diazonium salts, but wait, that's usually with aromatic amines. Or maybe it's something else. Oh wait, another thought: maybe it's the Beckmann rearrangement? Because I remember that when you have a hydroxylamine (NH2OH) reacting with ketones, you get a rearrangement. But wait, the reagents here are NaNO2, HCl, and water. Oh, wait, right, that's the conditions for the formation of a diazonium salt from an aromatic amine, but those aren't in the products here. The products are diketones, so maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the Stephen reduction? No, that uses a different setup. Or perhaps the Robinson annulation? Hmm, not sure. Wait, another thought: the treatment of a carbonyl with HCl and nitrous acid. Wait, maybe it's the formation of a gem-dialdehyde from a gem-dihydroxy compound? Oh wait, no. Or perhaps it's the oxidation of an alcohol. Wait, or maybe it's the von Braun degradation? I'm a bit confused, but let me think.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the treatment of a secondary or tertiary alcohol with HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh! I think I remember now. That's the reaction where an alcohol is converted into a ketone or aldehyde. How does that work?

Right, the process is the Stephen reduction? No, wait. Oh, wait, wait! The reaction where an alcohol is treated with HCl, sodium nitrite, and water is called the Haworth reaction. Wait, no, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Criegee glycol oxidation. Wait, Criegee is when a diol is oxidized to a diketone with periodic acid. Oh, that's right! So when a vicinal diol (a 1,2-diol) is treated with HIO4 (periodic acid), it cleaves to form two carbonyl groups. So for example, if you have HO
