Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually used in the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to form an acid. Wait, no, wait. Or maybe that's another reagent. Wait, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of acid chlorides, right? So if the compound has an acid chloride group, reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would convert the acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. So the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But wait, maybe I should look at the IR and NMR data first to figure out what Compound X is. Because knowing what X is will help me figure out what happens when it reacts.

Looking at the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region usually indicates an OH stretch, like from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, wait. Also, there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. I think that's a carbonyl group. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe in other compounds like esters it's higher. Alternatively, if it's an acid chloride, the carbonyl is around 1800. But 1720 seems more like an ester or a ketone or maybe a carboxylic acid. Hmm. Wait, the 1720 could be an ester because carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 3000-2500 (O-H stretch) and a strong peak around 1700 for the carbonyl. But in the IR, there's also 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound has a benzene ring.

In the NMR, let's look at the signals:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, wait— no, wait. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but as a triplet
