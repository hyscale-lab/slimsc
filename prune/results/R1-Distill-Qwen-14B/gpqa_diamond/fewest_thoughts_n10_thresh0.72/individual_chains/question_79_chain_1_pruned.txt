Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The question is about identifying a compound X based on an NMR analysis of its product after a reaction. The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and we have to choose from four options.

Hmm, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent. I remember it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors. Oh right, Sharpless epoxidation typically converts an allyl ether into an epoxide. So, compound X is likely an allyl ether that, after reaction, forms an epoxide.

So the options are all epoxide-related structures. Let's look at each option:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure-wise, that's an epoxide with a styryl group (a vinyl benzene) attached. The substituents would be at specific positions.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So, the oxirane has a substituent that's a propenyl group with a phenyl on the first carbon. That would make the substituent a trans- configuration perhaps.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. The oxirane has a methyl group and a styryl group on adjacent carbons. So, the substituents would be on carbons 2 and 3 of the epoxide.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That sounds like a simple styryl group attached to the 2-position of an epoxide. So the substituent is directly on one of the epoxide oxygens' adjacent carbons.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's focus on the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR shows:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an aromatic ring or an electronegative atom.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): another methyl, possibly in a similar environment as the first, but maybe a different substitution pattern.
Wait, or maybe they're part of different groups. Hmm.

Wait, styryl groups are like benzene rings connected by a double bond. So in styryl, we have Ph-CH2-CH2- or Ph-CH=CH-. No, wait, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2, I think. So in the product, which is an epoxide, perhaps the epoxide is formed between two carbons that were part of a double bond in the starting material.

So the starting material X is an allyl ether. After epoxidation, the double bond becomes an epoxide, with two new oxygen atoms.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the aromatic signals are:

6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H).

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about splitting. So, for aromatic protons, the coupling depends on neighboring Hs. If we have a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be two doublets each integrating to 2H. But here, the H NMR has four signals: a 1H, a 2H, another 1H, and another 2H. So maybe it's a substituted styryl group where the substituents are in positions that split the aromatic protons into these patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic ring has substituents that cause different shifts. Let me consider the possible structures.

In the 13C NMR, there are signals from 21.3, 28.4, 126.9, 127.1, etc. The 21 and 28 ppm are likely for CH3 groups. The 126-130 region is for sp2 carbons, like in aromatic rings or double bonds. The 141 and 144 ppm are probably carbons attached to oxygen, like the epoxide carbons. The 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, but wait, the product is an epoxide, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, no, the epoxide has two adjacent carbons each attached to an oxygen. Wait, the epoxide carbons are typically around 60-70 ppm, but maybe the 13C NMR is for the starting material? Wait no, the problem says the product's NMR is given. So the product would have an epoxide, which is two adjacent carbons each attached to an oxygen. But 197.7 is a high value, more like a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. That's odd because the product should be an epoxide.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the 13C NMR data.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

- 21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s): these are probably two different methyl groups.
- 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, 197.7 is a carbonyl, so where does that come from? Maybe the starting material had a carbonyl that's preserved, but the reaction is epoxidation. Alternatively, perhaps the product has a carbonyl, but that doesn't fit with epoxide.

Wait, maybe compound X is an allyl ether, and the reaction forms an epoxide, but perhaps another functional group is present.

Alternatively, maybe the 197.7 is an epoxide oxygen-bearing carbon? No, I don't think so. Epoxide carbons are usually around 50-60 ppm. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let's think about the structure of the product. An epoxide would have two adjacent CH2 groups each attached to O. But in the product, the 13C NMR shows a carbonyl, which suggests maybe the starting material was a ketone, but that doesn't fit with the reaction reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but not an epoxide. But the reaction reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclooctane, which is used for epoxidation, so the product should be an epoxide.

Hmm, confusion arises. Let me re-examine the options.

All options are epoxides. The question is which starting material would form the product with the given NMR.

Wait, perhaps the product's NMR data
