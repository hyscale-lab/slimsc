Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. So, there's an electron and a positron moving towards each other. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Both are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has a Lorentz factor of 2. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. The photons have the same energy, and one is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're an electron and a positron, their rest mass is the same, so the energy involved should come from their kinetic energies plus their rest mass energy.

Wait, the question says the photons have the same energy. That probably means they have equal energies but opposite momenta? Or maybe not. Since energy is a scalar, same energy, but their directions are opposite in some way.

Wait, but both photons are moving to the right. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. So they're both moving in the right direction but in opposite vertical directions.

I think I should consider conservation of momentum here. Because the initial particles have momentum, so the photons must carry off momentum in such a way that the total momentum remains the same.

Let me think. The system consists of an electron and a positron. So their momenta and energies need to be calculated.

First, the electron is moving from the left. Its Lorentz factor is gamma_e = 4. The positron is moving from the right, so its direction is opposite. Its gamma_p = 2.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), so it's always greater than or equal to 1. So the electron is moving much faster than the positron.

I think I need to find the total momentum of the system before annihilation.

The momentum of each particle is gamma * m * v, but perhaps it's easier to work in terms of gamma and the rest mass.

But wait, the rest mass of electron and positron is the same. Let's denote m as the rest mass (like, m_e for electron, same as positron).

So, the momentum of the electron is gamma_e * m * v_e. But since gamma is known, perhaps I can express momentum
