Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me read through it again. Hmm, the question gives a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find its kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh right, so this looks like a Yukawa coupling kind of interaction, where the boson X couples to fermions with a coupling strength λ. The term v is probably the vacuum expectation value, but maybe I don't need that for the decay.

So X is a boson, and it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decay products depend on the available energy and the masses of the fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. For a decay to be allowed, the total mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X. Since X is a boson, it's either a scalar or vector, but that probably doesn't matter here for decay into fermions.

Now, the possible fermions that X can decay into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So the individual fermion mass would be half of that, right? Because each fermion would have mass m, and the pair would be 2m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Fermions come in different generations. Let me list out the known fermion masses.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses (approximate):

- Up: ~2 MeV
- Down: ~4-5 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV

Leptons: electron, muon, tau, their masses:

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV
- Muon: ~105.7 MeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV

So, the fermions that have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV would include all except the top quark and tau and maybe some others? Wait, the tau is ~1.78 GeV, so 2m would be ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed because 2*1.78 = 3.56 <6 GeV. Wait, no—wait, 1.78 GeV each, so 2*1.78 is 3.56 GeV. That's less than 6, so yes, tau can be a decay product.

Similarly, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. Then 2m would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So a pair of b quarks would require the X to have mass at least 9 GeV, which it doesn't. So X cannot decay into b quark pairs.

Wait, but wait. Wait, X has mass 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where each has mass less than 3 GeV would be allowed. Because 2m ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

So let's see:

Leptons:

- Electron: 0.5 MeV → yes
- Muon: ~105 MeV → yes
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV → 1.78 < 3 → yes

Quarks:

- Up: 2 MeV → yes
- Down: ~5 MeV → yes
- Strange: ~100 MeV → yes
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV → yes
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → no
- Top: way too heavy → no

So possible fermion pairs are e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u, d, s, c quarks and their anti-particles. So the decay products could be any of these.

But looking at the options, some of them include b quarks, which I think are not allowed because 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So any option that includes b quark pairs is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But b's mass would require 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV, so this decay isn't allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e pairs.

Wait, c quark is about 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 =3 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed. So c cbar is allowed.

But wait, wait, the X has a mass of 6 GeV. So do the fermions include all quarks up to charm?

Yes, because charm is 1.5 GeV, 2m=3 GeV, which is allowed.

So option B's decay includes c cbar, which would
