Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, two reactions to consider here, and I need to pick the major products from the options given. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First reaction is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water, giving product B.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure mentally. It's a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. So numbering the ring, position 1 is the ketone. Then at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl would imply two methyl groups at 2 and 6; wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group? Or maybe it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Hmm, no, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So on the cyclohexane ring, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group as substituents. Wait, but 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl, and position 6 has a methyl. So, two substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl), and a methyl at C6.

So, the ring looks like this: position 1 is the ketone (O=C-). Position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl. Position 6 has a methyl. Now, when reacting with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions, I think it's a Diels-Alder reaction. Oh wait, but wait, the starting material is a ketone. Oh! So maybe the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates to form an enolate,
