Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their observations in the electromagnetic spectrum, and I need to figure out the comoving distance based on some cosmological parameters. Hmm, let's break this down.

The question says that when they observe a quasar in the near infrared and optical spectrum, they see a peak at about 790 nm. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes have a characteristic peak. But how does this relate to the distance?

Wait, the peak at 790 nm—oh, wait, that's in the near infrared. But the key here might be that the flux drops below that. I think this relates to the Lyman-alpha forest or something like that. Oh right! The Lyman-alpha emission line is at about 121.6 nm in the rest frame. But if that line is observed at a longer wavelength, it's due to redshift. So if the observed wavelength is longer, the object must be moving away from us, causing redshift.

Wait, but in this case, the peak is at 790 nm. That's much longer than 121 nm. So the Lyman-alpha line would be redshifted if the quasar is at a high redshift. But wait, the question is about the comoving distance, so it's about how far away the quasar is.

But wait, the peak at 790 nm and flux drop below that—could that be the Lyman break? Oh yes! The Lyman break is the transition from the Lyman series to
