Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra, which should help in determining the structure of Compound X first. Then, I have to predict the product after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Alright, let's start by analyzing the spectral data.

First, looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range. That usually suggests the presence of either an O-H stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or an N-H stretch (amines). But looking at the other IR peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. That's a carbonyl (C=O) group. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching or maybe something else. But the 1720 peak is significant. So maybe it's a ketone, aldehyde, or ester? Or perhaps a carboxylic acid? Wait, but the 1720 is more in line with a ketone or ester. Carboxylic acids typically have a broader O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but their carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1 as well, but maybe a bit higher. Wait, but the first IR peak is from 3400 to 2500. If there was a strong O-H stretch, it would be in that range. But I'm not seeing a very strong peak around 3000-3300. Wait, the first part is 3400–2500 as a range, but the individual peaks are 3400–2500 (broad, maybe O-H?), 1720 (C=O), 1610, and 1450.

Wait, the 3400–2500 could be an O-H stretch or an N-H stretch. But another possibility is that this is an alkyne C-H stretch, which appears around 3300 cm-1. No, wait, alkynes have two strong absorption bands around 3300. Hmm. Or maybe it's an amine, but let's think about the NMR.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a broad singlet, probably an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, which fits. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Another peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The two doublets each integrating for 2H suggest a symmetrical substitution. Like two substituents in the para positions causing the doublets. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a group that's causing the splitting. So perhaps a substituent on the benzene that has ortho and para protons, but in this case, the splitting suggests coupling between the aromatic protons. Wait, but for a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituent would be equivalent, so the splitting would be as doublets. So maybe the substituent is at the para position, and the two sets of doublets are the two ortho protons and the two meta protons? Or wait, perhaps it's a substituent that's in the para position, making each pair of protons (ortho and meta) split into doublets. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is something else.

Wait, the integral is 2H each, so there are four aromatic protons in total. That suggests a disubstituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, making each substituent flanked by two protons. So the substituents are on carbons 1 and 3? No, wait, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para), then the ring would have two sets of two equivalent protons each. But wait, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the ring would have protons at 2, 3, 5, and 6. Those would split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches the NMR data.

So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. But wait, the integration is 2H each for the two doublets, so four aromatic protons in total. So the substituents are in the para positions, each substituent having two adjacent protons. Wait, but if it's a single substituent in the para position, like a methyl group, then the ring would have four equivalent protons, but in the case of a single substituent, the aromatic protons would be two doublets each integrating 2H. So that's possible.

But wait, the substituent could be something else. Let's think about the other NMR peaks.

The next peak is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet integrating for
