Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and titration calculations can get tricky. But let's break it down step by step. I remember that when dealing with titrations, especially weak acids with strong bases, there are a few key concepts I need to apply.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when we mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (20 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40 cm³ = (1/40) / 2, so maybe 0.025 M? Wait, let me compute that. 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles of acetic acid initially are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, total volume is 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. I think 25% means that 25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH. So first, I need to find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration.

So, moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1 (acetic acid + NaOH → acetate + water), the moles of NaOH added would be 0.00025 mol.

Next, I need to find the volume of NaOH added. The concentration is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 mL. So at 25% titration, 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Now, to find the pH, I think I should calculate the concentrations of the species present. After the reaction, some of the acetic acid will have been neutralized to form acetate ions.

So, the initial moles are:
Acetic acid: 0.001 mol
NaOH added: 0.00025 mol

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, the moles after reaction:
CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol
CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol

The total volume of the solution is the original 40 mL plus the NaOH added, which is 2.5 mL. So
