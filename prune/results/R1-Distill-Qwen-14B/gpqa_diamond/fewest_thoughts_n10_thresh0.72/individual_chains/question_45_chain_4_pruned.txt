Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each giving different combinations of energies.

Wait, first, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula is En = (n²)E, where E is the base energy (n=1), so n is an integer. So each particle's energy is proportional to the square of its quantum number.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, which means they're fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since the particles are in the same potential well, their quantum numbers (n) must be unique, but because they have spin, each state can hold two particles (spin up and spin down).

So here's the thing: each energy level can hold two particles, one for each spin state. So the filling of the energy levels will depend on how many particles we have and the order of their energy levels.

Let me write down the steps:

1. The particles are spin-1/2 fermions, so each energy level (each n) can hold 2 particles (spin up and spin down).

2. The energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, 25E, etc., since En = n²E.

3. We have four particles to place into these energy levels, filling them according to the Pauli exclusion principle.

So the first step is to figure out how the four particles fill the energy levels.

Let's list the energy levels in order:

n=1 → E
n=2 →4E
n=3 →9E
n=4→16E
n=5→25E
and so on.

Each n can hold 2 particles. Since we have four particles, let's see how they fill.

Ground state: All particles are in the lowest possible energy states.

Starting from n=1: it can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold the next 2. So n=1 has 2, n=2 has 2. So four particles in total. So the configuration would be (n=1: 2 particles), (n=2: 2 particles).

Wait, but wait: in the
