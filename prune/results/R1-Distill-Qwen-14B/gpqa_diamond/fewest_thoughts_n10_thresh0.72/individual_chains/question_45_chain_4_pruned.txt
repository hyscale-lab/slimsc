Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each giving different combinations of energies.

Wait, first, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula is En = (n²)E, where E is the base energy (n=1), so n is an integer. So each particle's energy is proportional to the square of its quantum number.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, which means they're fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since the particles are in the same potential well, their quantum numbers (n) must be unique, but because they have spin, each state can hold two particles (spin up and spin down).

So here's the thing: each energy level can hold two particles, one for each spin state. So the filling of the energy levels will depend on how many particles we have and the order of their energy levels.

Let me write down the steps:

1. The particles are spin-1/2 fermions, so each energy level (each n) can hold 2 particles (spin up and spin down).

2. The energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, 25E, etc., since En = n²E.

3. We have four particles to place into these energy levels, filling them according to the Pauli exclusion principle.

So the first step is to figure out how the four particles fill the energy levels.

Let's list the energy levels in order:

n=1 → E
n=2 →4E
n=3 →9E
n=4→16E
n=5→25E
and so on.

Each n can hold 2 particles. Since we have four particles, let's see how they fill.

Ground state: All particles are in the lowest possible energy states.

Starting from n=1: it can hold 2 particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can hold the next 2. So n=1 has 2, n=2 has 2. So four particles in total. So the configuration would be (n=1: 2 particles), (n=2: 2 particles).

Wait, but wait: in the

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula given is E = (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), and each particle's energy depends on their quantum number, n.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, that means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n, right? But wait, since the particles are spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states (up or down). So for each energy level n, there can be two particles with the same n but different spins.

So the system is a four-particle system. Let's think about the ground state first. Ground state is the lowest energy configuration. The first energy level is n=1. Since each n can hold two particles (due to spin), the first two particles can be in n=1 with opposite spins. The next two need higher energy levels.

So what's the next available n? n=2. But wait, n=2 can accommodate two particles, but since we have four particles, we need to fill up until four. So the first two go into n=1, the next two into n=2. Wait, but for identical particles, do I have to arrange them in a way that their quantum numbers are all unique? Or do I just fill the lowest levels first with as many as possible?

Wait, for fermions, each state (defined by n and spin) can hold one particle. So each n can have two particles (two spin states). So four particles would fill the first two energy levels.

Wait, n=1 can have two particles, n=2 can also have two. So all four will be in n=1 and n=2. So the ground state's total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Each particle's energy is E_n = (n²) * E, because E scales with n². So for n=1, E1 = E. For n=2, E2 = 4E.

So two particles in n=1: their energy is 2 * E. Two particles in n=2: 2 * 4E = 8E. Total ground state energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but looking at the options, option B and C have 10E as the first excited state. Hmm, maybe I missed something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in the ground state, perhaps the particles are arranged in the lowest possible energy with the minimal possible energy, considering the exclusion principle. Let me think again.

Each particle in the ground state is in the lowest possible state. So for four particles:

- The first particle is n=1, spin up.
- Second: n=1, spin down.
- Third: n=2, spin up.
- Fourth: n=2, spin down.

So the energies are 2E (for n=1) and 8E (for n=2), adding to 10E. So ground state energy is 10E? But looking at the options, none have 10E as the ground state. Let me check.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let's check each option's first energy.

Option A: 30E, 39E, 50E.

Wait, probably not, because 30E is much higher.

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E.

So ground state is 4E, first excited is 10E, second excited is 50E.

Option C: 4E, 10E,15E.

D: 10,15,18.

So according to my previous calculation, the ground state energy is 10E. But none of the options have that as the first option. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that for each particle in the same n, their spins are different. So for four particles, maybe the first two are in n=1 with spin up and down, and the next two must go into n=2, each with spin up and down. So the energies are 1E each for two particles, and 4E each for the other two.

So total energy is (2*1E) + (2*4E) = 2E +8E = 10E. So ground state is 10E. But looking at the options, the only option where the first energy is 10E is option D, which says first is 10E, but that's the first excited state.

Wait, no, the question is about the
