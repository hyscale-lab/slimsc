Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let's try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup: there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and then it's turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic moment mu is related to the spin. For a spin-1/2 particle, Sz can be ± ħ/2, right? So mu = gamma * Sz. Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, I think. But the exact expression might not matter for the frequency part.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with the field. The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by U = -mu · B. So when the field is along Z, the energy levels would be based on the Sz component.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off, the particle is in a state with definite Sz. But then the field is turned on along Y. So the Hamiltonian changes. Before, the Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz, and after, it's proportional to Sy. Because the magnetic field is now along Y, the new Hamiltonian H would be proportional to Sy.

Wait, the system is prepared in an eigenstate of Sz before the field change. After the field changes, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to Sy. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in the expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment. Hmm. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, the z-component is gamma Sz. So the average of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of Sz.

So to find the oscillation frequency of <Sz>, I need to look at how the expectation value of Sz evolves over time when the system's Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

I remember that when a two-level system is subjected to a Hamiltonian that's off-diagonal in the basis of the original states, the expectation values oscillate with a frequency related to the energy splitting.

Wait, the energy splitting in the original (Z) direction was determined by gamma B h-bar? Wait, no, the energy levels are given by E = -mu · B. So for Sz, E = -gamma Sz B. Since Sz can be ± ħ/2, the energy difference between the two states is gamma B ħ. But wait, when the field is along Y, the energy levels will be determined by Sy, which has eigenvalues ± gamma B ħ/2.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the energy levels play into the oscillation frequency. Let me think about the time evolution.

The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz. After the field is turned along Y, the new Hamiltonian H' is proportional to Sy. Let
