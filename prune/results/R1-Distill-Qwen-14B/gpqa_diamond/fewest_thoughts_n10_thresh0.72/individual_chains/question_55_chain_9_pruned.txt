Okay, so I've got this NMR question to tackle. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, the compound is an organic one, and the options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

The NMR data provided is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

Alright, so I need to figure out what this structure looks like based on the signals.

First, let me recall what each part of the NMR tells me. The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is probably an acetyl group, like the ester in acetate. So the molecule is likely an acetate ester.

Then, looking at the other signals. There's a doublet at 7.0 ppm. That's a high ppm, so aromatic or maybe an alkene. Wait, in acetates, the substituent is usually an alkyl group, but if it's a propenyl or butenyl, there's a double bond.

Wait, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq) for 1H. That suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe that's a vinyl proton, part of a double bond.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) might be a methyl group attached to something, perhaps a double bond. Like a CH2CH2CH3 group, but wait, the butenyl would have a longer chain. Or maybe a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

Let me think about the structure. The molecule is an acetate, so the structure is something like R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, wait. No, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3, but as an ester, it's R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, correction: Acetate esters are usually R-O-COCH3, where R is the substituent. So the structure is R-O-COCH3.

Wait no, wait, actually, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkyl from the acid (like acetic acid) and R' is the other part. Wait,
