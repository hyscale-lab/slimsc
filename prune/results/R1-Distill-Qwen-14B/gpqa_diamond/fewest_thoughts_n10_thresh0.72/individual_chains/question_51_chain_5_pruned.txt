Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to calculate the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, so the sphere is conducting and it's grounded. Oh right, when a conducting sphere is grounded, it means it's in contact with the Earth, so any excess charge can flow to or from the Earth. But wait, in this case, the charge q is outside the sphere, so what happens to the sphere?

I remember that for a conducting sphere, the charges reside on the surface. Since it's grounded, any induced charges will adjust accordingly. But wait, the sphere is initially neutral, right? Because the problem doesn't mention any other charge on it. So when we place a charge q near it, the sphere's electrons will be attracted or repelled, creating an induced charge.

Wait, when you have a charge outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute. If the charge is positive, the sphere's electrons (negative) will be attracted to the near side, leaving the far side positively charged. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced negative charge can flow into the ground, making the sphere's near side less negative, but wait, actually, the ground provides a path for the charges to move.

Wait, no. Wait a second. If the sphere
