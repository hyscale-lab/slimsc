Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what I remember from my classes. Hmm, I think radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? But wait, how does that apply here?

The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that means if we have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed. But wait, the problem is about a single atom. Oh, right, in radioactive decay, each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and the law is memoryless. That's the key point.

So the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, what does that mean for the next 150 minutes? Oh, wait a second, the total time after 50 minutes would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But no, wait, the question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 have already passed without decay.

Wait, no. The initial condition was that the probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that sets the decay constant or the half-life or something. But how?

I think the decay probability in a small time interval is proportional to the time. But maybe I should model it using the decay equation. The decay law
