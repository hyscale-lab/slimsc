Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question gives three different reactions labeled A, B, and C, each involving Michael additions. We need to determine the products of these reactions from the given options.

First, I'll try to understand each reaction individually.

Starting with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a malonate ester, which can easily form the enolate under basic conditions. Sodium ethoxide is a strong base and would deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would have the acrylate group (CH2=CHCOO-) attached to a methyl group and a p-tolyl group. Wait, actually, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)O-Me, but the substituent is at the 3-position. Hmm, maybe it's more like the structure is CH2-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the double bond. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, the structure of acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the acrylate part as CH2=CHCOO-Me, but the substituent is at the third position, which would be the alpha position to the carbonyl. So maybe it's more like CH2=C(p-tolyl)COO-Me. Wait, no, wait. The numbering could be a bit tricky. Let me think. For acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me. So if it's
