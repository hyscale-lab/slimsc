Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

Wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. And the state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

But wait, first, I should make sure I understand the setup. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That probably means that the state we're given is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. So the state is already diagonal with respect to P_z, which might make things easier.

Wait no, actually, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state is expressed in the P_z basis. So in this basis, the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I can just calculate the expectation value of P_z in this state. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, because the basis is its eigenvectors, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities. 

Wait, let me think again. The matrix for P_z is given as diag(ħ, 0, -ħ), right? So the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. So the state is a vector in this basis. So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of each component squared multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

So let's compute that. The state components are a = -1/2, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = -1/2.

So the probabilities are |a|², |b|², |c|².

Calculating |a|²: (1/2)^2 = 1/4.
|b|²: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.
|c|²: (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Wait, but wait. Since the state is a vector in the P_z basis, the expectation value is the sum of (probability) * (eigenvalue). So the components (a, b, c) are the amplitudes, so the probabilities are |a|^2, etc.

So the first term is 1/4 * ħ (since the first eigenvalue is ħ), the second term is 1/2 * 0 (since the middle eigenvalue is 0), and the third term is 1/4 * (-ħ). So yes, 1/4 -1/4 is zero.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Well, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will just have the squares of the eigenvalues on the diagonal. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. Squared, they become ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So then, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2 ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, that's one of the options. Option B is ħ/sqrt(2).

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps.

So, the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Compute |a|², which is ( (-1/2)^2 )= 1/4.

Same for |c|²: 1/4. |b|² is 1/2.

So the expectation is correctly calculated.

As for P_z squared, yes, each diagonal term is squared. So for the first term, it's ħ², third term is ħ². So the expectation value is indeed (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

So the correct answer is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The system is in the state $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, and the operator $P_z$ is diagonal in the basis of its eigenvectors with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where $|a|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$, $|b|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$, and $|c|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal in the same basis, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + |b|^2 \cdot 0 + |c|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting $|a|^2 = 1/4$, $|b|^2 = 1/2$, and $|c|^2 = 1/4$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
