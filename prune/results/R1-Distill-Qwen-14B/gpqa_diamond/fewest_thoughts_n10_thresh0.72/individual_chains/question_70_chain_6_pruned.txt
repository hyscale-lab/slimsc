Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's go through it carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions, and ultimately, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are all point groups from molecular symmetry, like in the crystal field theory or VSEPR theory.

Let me break down the information given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. So, A + 8B → C. What could this be? Bright red products often make me think of certain transition metal compounds. Maybe something like sulfur? Or perhaps a transition metal oxide or sulfide?

Wait, another thought: The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. E is dangerous, like maybe a toxic gas or something reactive.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So, when C is in water, it breaks down into A, and two acids. Since F is strong and G weak, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G H2SO3 (weak, which is sulfurous acid) or something similar. But wait, if C is a salt, maybe when it reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into a strong acid and a weak acid.

Wait, what kind of compounds hydrolyze into two different acids? Maybe an sulfite or sulfate? Alternatively, maybe a nitrate? Wait, no. Let's think about possible salts.

Wait, let's think about the third reaction first. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is strong, G is weak. So, maybe C is a sulfite salt because when sulfites react with water, they can produce H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak) and possibly another acid. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate or something else.

Wait, but if C is a sulfite, then the acids would be H2SO3 and maybe another one. Or perhaps C is a bisulfate or something else.

Wait, another possibility
