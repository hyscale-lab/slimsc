Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. And we need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when an electron transitions from the second energy level to the first. But in this case, it's about absorption, right? So, the clouds are absorbing this light.

Redshift comes into play here because the observed wavelength depends on how much the universe has expanded since the light was emitted. The formula I think is the redshift z is (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. So z = (λ_obs - λ_emit) / λ_emit.

But wait, the quasar emits light at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. But when this light travels through the hydrogen cloud, the cloud's motion (or the expansion of the universe) affects the wavelength. Oh, right! So if the cloud is moving away from us, the wavelength gets stretched, which is redshifted. But wait, the question is about detecting the absorption line using optical telescopes. Oh, wait, optical telescopes detect visible light, which is longer wavelength than UV. So if the Lyman alpha is originally in UV (1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is UV), but if the cloud is at a high enough redshift, the absorbed light might shift into the optical range where ground-based telescopes can see it.

Wait no, the quasar emits the Lyman alpha line, but if the cloud is at a redshift z, then the observed wavelength would be λ = 1216 * (1 + z). But for the absorption to be in the optical range, λ should be around 400 nm to 700 nm or so. Because optical light is roughly 400-700 nm.

Wait, let me get this straight. The quasar's light has the Lyman alpha at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm, which is in the UV). But if the cloud
