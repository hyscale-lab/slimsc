Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen signals are in the NMR spectrum of the final product. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions leading to product 4. I'll need to figure out the structure of each product to determine the structure of product 4. Only then can I analyze its NMR.

Starting with the first reaction: acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when acetic acid is treated with bromine in the presence of pyridine and an acid anhydride, it's usually a bromination reaction. Pyridine acts as a catalyst here, right? So the acetic acid would undergo bromination. Wait, maybe it's more like the formation of an acyl bromide. Oh wait, I think bromine (Br2) in pyridine can act as a reagent for forming acyl bromides. So acetic acid reacting with Br2 and acetic anhydride... wait, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type situation? Or perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, acetic acid has an -OH group. But under these conditions, maybe it's forming a bromide. Alternatively, maybe it's the benzoylation? Wait, no, acetic acid is CH3COOH. Wait, perhaps when treated with Br2, it's undergoing substitution. Wait, but in acetic acid, the hydroxyl is on the CH3. So maybe it's an acetylation or substitution.

Wait, another thought: when you have Br2 and pyridine, it's often used for the bromination of alcohols. But wait, acetic acid is a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, maybe it's more about forming an acetyl bromide. Acetic anhydride can act as a source of acetyl groups. So perhaps the reaction is acetic acid reacting with Br2 and acetic anhydride to form an acetylated bromide.

Wait, let me think about it. Another possibility is that the reaction is introducing a bromine into the acetic acid. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. If it's brominated, perhaps the -OH is replaced by Br? But substitution on a carboxylic acid would lead to CH3COBr. Oh right! So in
