Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem says that a chemist does two reactions using (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each is treated with mCPBA, then aqueous acid. Both reactions go to completion. Then the products are mixed and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation adds an oxygen atom across the double bond, forming an epoxide. So, each reaction forms an epoxide.

Wait, but the stereochemistry might matter here. For epoxidation with mCPBA, the reaction typically proceeds via a cyclic transition state, which leads to the formation of an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. No, actually, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry of the starting alkene is retained in the epoxide. Like, for trans addition or something like that.

Wait, no. Let me correct myself. The epoxidation using mCPBA is a peracid reacting with an alkene in a concerted manner. The oxygen is added to the same face of the alkene, so the stereochemistry of the double bond affects the structure of the epoxide.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene: the double bond is trans. When mCPBA adds an oxygen, the epoxide will have the same stereochemistry as the double bond. So the two carbons where the oxygen is added will have the opposite configuration. Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it out mentally.

Wait, (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on each end of the double bond opposite each other. So, for example, imagine CH2CH2 groups on either end, but in the trans configuration. When mCPBA adds the epoxide, the oxygen comes in from the same face, leading to a trans arrangement in the epoxide. Hmm, no, wait, maybe the epoxide ring will have the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the transition state. The reaction is a
