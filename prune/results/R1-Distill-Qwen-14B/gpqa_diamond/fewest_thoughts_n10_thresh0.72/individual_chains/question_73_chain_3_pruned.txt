Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, the question is about finding their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Alright, let's break this down.

So, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just add them normally because of relativity. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. I think it's something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so I should subtract their speeds.

Let me write that down. So astronaut A is at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. The relative speed, v_rel, would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²]. Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c.

Now, the energy part. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I need to calculate their energies using E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass is 2m, velocity 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 mc².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc², which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is too low. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.
