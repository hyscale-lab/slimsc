Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think through it.

The question involves two reactions, I and II, each starting with different compounds and using different reagents. After both reactions are done, their products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

First, I need to understand each reaction and determine the products formed.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one is a ketone, so LAH would reduce the ketone group to a secondary alcohol. But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration, so the stereochemistry might matter.

Let me draw the structure. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Let me correct that. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3, but the 5 position has a methoxy group. So structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Hexan is six carbons. So numbering from one end: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So position 3 is the ketone. So structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2-? Wait, perhaps I should write it more clearly.

The structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but maybe that's not correct. Let me count. Carbon 1: CH2-, carbon 2: CH2-, carbon 3: C=O, carbon 4: CH-OCH3, carbon 5: CH2, carbon 6: CH3. So hexan-3-one is correct.

So when LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is used to reduce a ketone, it becomes
