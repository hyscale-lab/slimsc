Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated. I think I should first figure out the structure to count the number of each type of bond.

The problem gives me some bond energies. Oh right, enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula is something like: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of products) - (sum of bond energies of reactants). Wait, no, wait. No, I think for the molecule, the formation from elements would involve breaking bonds in the reactants (like C and H2) and forming the molecule's bonds.

Wait, no. The standard approach for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is to consider the reaction where elements in their standard states (like CO2, H2O, etc.) form the compound. But in this case, maybe it's treated as forming the molecule from its constituent atoms, but since it's a hydrocarbon, it's probably assumed to be formed from C and H2.

Wait, but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right! The enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to form isolated atoms. For carbon, that's the bond energy of C-C in graphite
