Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe their masses aren't directly relevant except perhaps for other factors like their lifetimes or evolution. Hmm, but the problem says to use the EW method with LTE, which are about measuring abundances, so maybe the masses don't factor into the calculations here.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex and [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. I remember that these are logarithmic abundance ratios. The subscript denotes which star they belong to, right?

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. Wait, how do I interpret that? Oh, because 12 is a standard value, so for the Sun, log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12? No, wait, I think it's the other way around. The equation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value, where X is an element. So for Fe, it's 7.5, so log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH)=7 -12= -5.

Wait wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh no, wait, perhaps the formula is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) + 12. So if that's the case, then for the Sun, [Fe/H] would be 7.5-12? No, no, because the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 0, but in the question, the Sun's [Fe/H] is 7.5? Wait, no, the question says the Sun's photospheric composition is 12 + log
