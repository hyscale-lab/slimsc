Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So, I'm picturing something like HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but wait, it's a cis-alkene. Oh right, the double bond is between two carbons, and the groups on each carbon are on the same side. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH with the double bond in the middle. No, wait, that's a single bond. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the middle carbons. So like HOOC-CH2-CH₂-CH2-COOH, but that can't be because the double bond would be in the middle, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, wait, dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene—so perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond, meaning it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with the CH₂ groups being adjacent, but that can't have a double bond. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the substituents on the same side, so cis. So the dicarboxylic acid is like HO₂C-CH₂CH₂-CO₂H but with a double bond, so it's HO₂C-CH₂CH₂-CO₂H but wait, that's a single bond. Oh wait, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene, so perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that can't be, because that's single bonds. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond, so it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's not right. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond, making it a diene. Wait, no. Maybe the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So, HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond, so it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not possible. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond in the middle, so it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but the middle bond is a double bond, like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with the CH₂ groups as CH₂=CH. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with the central two carbons being a double bond. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH becomes HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not correct because a double bond would be between the two CH₂ groups, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? Wait, no, that can't be. I think I'm mixing up the structure here. Let me think again.

The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. So the structure is probably something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with the middle CH₂ groups having a double bond. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with the CH₂ groups being CH₂=CH. So the correct structure would be HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that's not a double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the CH's, so it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH—no, that's a single bond. I'm getting stuck here, but maybe I should move on and see if the rest of the problem helps.

The dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its 1H NMR and two peaks in its 13C NMR at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about what that could be.

The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a downfield shift. So, maybe it's an aromatic proton? But wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Wait, but when it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride structure would have two carboxylic anhydride groups connected by the former double bond. So, the dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid would form a cyclic anhydride. Wait, no, because if the starting material is a cis-alkene, when dehydrated, it would form an anhydride with a double bond in the ring. Wait, maybe it's a five-membered ring, like maleic anhydride. Oh right, maleic anhydride is formed from
