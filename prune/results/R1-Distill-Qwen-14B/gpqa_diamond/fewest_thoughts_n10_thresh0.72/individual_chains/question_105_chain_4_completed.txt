Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, we'll see brightness variations due to these spots. The problem says this situation can look like an exoplanet transiting the star. We need to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same light curve amplitude as the spots do. So, the question is asking for Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness (the transit depth) is proportional to (Rplanet / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star, and brightness is proportional to area.

But wait, the star in this problem isn't just a simple case. It has spots, and when the spots rotate into and out of view, the observed brightness changes. So the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is different from that of a planet.

Let me think about how the spots contribute. The star's total brightness is the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% of the star's area is spots, and those spots are cooler.

The star's total flux without spots can be considered as F = sigma * Teff^4, where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But when spots are present, the flux from the star is F_total = F_unspotted * (1 - filling factor) + F_spotted * filling factor.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the surface is spots, and 0.8 is normal. The flux from the spots is F_spotted = sigma * (Teff - delta T)^4? Or wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots are 5000 K. So F_spotted = sigma * (5000)^4.

So, the total flux from the star (F_total) when spots are visible on one hemisphere would be F_total = 0.8 * F_normal + 0.2 * F_spotted.

But wait, the star's rotation means that the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then moves away, causing a periodic change in brightness. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the observed flux changes compared to when they're on the back.

Wait, but the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spotted half comes into view, and then it goes away. So the maximum and minimum brightness depends on how much of the spotted area is visible as the star rotates.

Wait, no, the star is a sphere, so when it rotates, we see different parts. But the spots are on one hemisphere. When the center of the hemisphere is facing us, we see the most spots. As the star rotates, the spots come into view more or less. Wait, perhaps the effect is that as the star rotates, the spots go from being on the far side (so we don't see any) to being on the near side (so we see all of them). But since it's a hemisphere, perhaps the maximum coverage is when the spot center is directly facing us.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's rotation makes the spots move across our line of sight, causing the observed brightness to vary as they pass in front.

Wait, but the problem says that the rotational modulation causes periodic brightness variations. So as the star spins, the spots come into and out of the field of view. The brightness variation amplitude depends on how much of the star's surface is spotted and the temperature difference between the spots and the rest.

But in the problem, the setup is that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is similar to that of an exoplanet transit. So the idea is that the observed change in brightness over time (the light curve) when the star has spots is similar in amplitude to when a planet transits. We need to find the planet radius that would produce the same amplitude.

So let's model both cases.

First, the star with spots: when the spotted hemisphere is not visible, the star's flux is at maximum. As the spots come into view, the flux decreases. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum flux.

For the planet transit: when the planet is in front of the star, it blocks some of the flux, so the flux drops. The amplitude is the difference between the normal flux and the flux during transit.

So, for both scenarios, the amplitude is the same. We need to compute the amplitude from the spotted star and set it equal to the amplitude from the planet transit, then solve for Rplanet/Rstar.

Let me compute the amplitude due to the spots first.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4.

When the spots are present, the total flux depends on how much of the star's surface is covered by spots. The filling factor is 0.2, so 20% of the surface is cooler.

So, the star's flux when spots are visible is F_spotty = 0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * (F0 * (T_spot / Teff)^4 )

Wait no, actually, each part of the star's surface emits flux based on its temperature. The unspotted regions are at Teff =6000 K, spots are at 5000 K.

So the total flux without spots is F0 = sigma * Teff^4.

The total flux with spots would be F_spotty = (1 - filling factor) * sigma * Teff^4 + filling factor * sigma * (Teff - deltaT)^4.

In this case, delta T is 1000 K, so spots are 5000 K.

So F_spotty = 0.8 * sigma * 6000^4 + 0.2 * sigma * 5000^4.

But when the star rotates, the spots are either visible or not. Wait, no. The star is one half spotted, so only when the spotted hemisphere is facing us do we see the spots. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, and the flux would be F0 again, because the visible hemisphere is unspotted.

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere, and one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the star is viewed face-on, the spotted hemisphere is either facing us or not. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots, so the flux is F_spotty. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the back, so we see the unspotted hemisphere, which has flux F0, because the entire hemisphere is at Teff.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So when the star is viewed face-on, and the spotted hemisphere is facing us, then 20% of the star's surface (the entire star) is spots, but when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the back, so 20% of the entire star's surface are spots, but none are visible. So the flux would be F0 when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and F_spotty when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Wait no, that can't be right. Because the spotted hemisphere is half the star, but the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So if the spotted hemisphere is 50% of the surface, but only 20% of the entire surface is spotted, that means each hemisphere (each 50% of the surface) has 10% of the surface covered in spots. Because 20% is for the entire star.

So when the spotted hemisphere (50% of the surface) is facing us, 20% of the entire surface is spots, which is 10% of the current hemisphere we're viewing. So in that case, the flux would be 0.9 * F0 + 0.1 * F_spotted.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The entire star has 20% spots. The star is a sphere, so when viewed from the front, the front hemisphere is 50% of the surface. The spots are spread over the entire star's surface, so if 20% is covered, then in the front hemisphere, 10% is covered, and the back hemisphere has 10% covered as well.

So, when the front hemisphere is visible, 10% of that hemisphere is spots, so 10% of the total surface area. So the flux when the front hemisphere (with spots) is facing us is F = (0.9 * F0) + (0.1 * F_spotted), where F_spotted is sigma*(5000)^4.

Similarly, when the back hemisphere is facing us, the front hemisphere is covered with 10% spots, but those are on the far side, so not visible. So the flux is F = (0.9 * F0) + (0.1 * F0) ) = F0 * (0.9 + 0.1) = F0.

Wait, that can't be right because when the back hemisphere is viewed, the front has 10% spots which are on the far side, so we don't see any spots. So the entire visible hemisphere is unspotted, so flux is F0, the same as the star's normal flux.

So when the front hemisphere (with 10% spots) is visible, the flux is F = 0.9 * F0 + 0.1 * F_spotted.

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me structure it again.

The entire star has a surface area of 4π R^2.

20% (0.2) of this is covered by spots. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 4π R^2.

The star is a sphere, so when viewed face-on, the visible area is 2π R^2 (the front hemisphere).

So when the front hemisphere is entirely unspotted, the flux is F0.

But the spots are spread over the entire star. So when the front hemisphere is viewed, some of the spots are on the back hemisphere, so not visible, and some are on the front.

Wait, if the entire star has 20% spots, then in the front hemisphere (which is 50% of the star's surface), how much of it is spotted?

The front hemisphere has 2π R^2 area. The total star is 4π R^2, with 0.2 of that being spots, so 0.8 is unspotted.

So in the front hemisphere, the percentage of spots is (0.2 / 4) ) * 100% = 5%. Wait, no, because the total spots are 0.2 of the star's surface, which is 4π R². So the front hemisphere (2π R²) would have 0.2/(4π R²) * 2π R² = 0.1, which is 10% of the front hemisphere covered in spots.

Ah, okay. So when the front hemisphere is facing us, 10% of it is spots, so 10% of 2π R² is spots. The rest is unspotted.

So the flux when the front hemisphere is visible is F = (0.9 * F0) + (0.1 * F_spotted).

Similarly, when the back hemisphere is visible, none of the front is spotted, so the entire front is unspotted. Wait, no. Wait, the back hemisphere is the one we're viewing. So the back hemisphere could have 10% of its area (which is 2π R²) covered in spots. So wait, the entire star has 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8 π R² of spots.

When the front hemisphere is viewed, the spots that are on the front hemisphere (0.1 * 2π R²) contribute to the flux. The rest are on the back, not visible.

When the back hemisphere is viewed, the front is not visible, so any spots on the back hemisphere (0.1 * 2π R²) contribute to the flux, but the front has no spots visible.

Wait, perhaps the way to think about this is that, regardless of which hemisphere is viewed, the flux from the spots is always 0.1 * F_spotted + 0.9 * F0, because the spots are spread across the entire star.

But no, that's not right. Because when the star rotates, the visible hemisphere changes. The spots that are on the opposite side (the back) are not visible. So when the front is viewed, the visible area is 2π R², of which 0.2 * (2π R²) is the front's spot coverage? Wait, no: the total spot coverage is 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8π R². So when looking at any hemisphere (front or back), the spot coverage on that hemisphere is 0.8π R² / 2 = 0.4π R², which is 0.4π R² / 2π R² = 20% of the visible hemisphere. Wait, wait, perhaps.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of it this way.

The entire star has 20% spots. So when we look at any hemisphere (front or back), the fraction of spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere) / (area of hemisphere) = 0.2. Because the spots are uniformly distributed.

Wait, no. If the spots are covering 20% of the entire star's surface, then when looking at any hemisphere (front or back), the fraction of spots in that hemisphere is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) / (hemisphere area) ) = 0.2. Wait, that can't be because the entire star is 100%, and 20% is spots.

Wait, no. The entire star's surface is 4π R². Spots cover 0.2 * 4π R² = 0.8π R².

When we look at one hemisphere (2π R²), the number of spots on that hemisphere depends on the distribution. But if the spots are spread uniformly, then the fraction of spots on any given hemisphere would be the same as their overall fraction. So 20% of the hemisphere is spots.

Wait, but that would only be the case if the spots are uniformly distributed across the entire star. So when you look at any hemisphere, 20% of that is spots.

Wait, that's an assumption. If the spots are all on one hemisphere, then when that hemisphere is viewed, the spots are 20% of the viewed hemisphere. When the other hemisphere is viewed, the spots are 0% of the viewed hemisphere.

But in the problem statement, it's said that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, so the spots are all on one side. So when that hemisphere is facing us, 20% of the area we see is spots. When the other hemisphere is facing, no spots are visible.

So in this case, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = (1 - 0.2) * F0 + 0.2 * F_spotted.

F_spotted is sigma * (5000 K)^4.

So F = 0.8 * sigma * (6000)^4 + 0.2 * sigma * (5000)^4.

When the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = sigma * (6000)^4, because none of the spots are visible.

So the variation in brightness when the star rotates is the difference between F and F0.

Wait, but F0 is the flux when no spots are visible. So when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F0. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F.

So the change in flux is F - F0 = [0.8 * sigma * 6000^4 + 0.2 * sigma *5000^4 ] - [ sigma *6000^4 ].

Which simplifies to F - F0 = sigma (0.8*6^4 + 0.2*5^4 - 6^4 )

= sigma (6^4 (0.8 -1) + 0.2 *5^4 )

= sigma (6^4 (-0.2) + 0.2 *5^4 )

= 0.2 sigma [ -6^4 +5^4 ]

Hmm, let's compute this.

6^4 = 1296.

5^4=625.

So 0.2 sigma [ -1296 + 625 ] = 0.2 sigma ( -671 ) = -0.1342 sigma.

The amplitude (the change in flux) is the maximum variation. But wait, since when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F = (0.8 *6^4 + 0.2*5^4) sigma.

Let me compute F:

F = 0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4) = 0.8 * 1.296e13 + 0.2 * 6.25e11.

Wait, in terms of sigma units:

F = sigma [0.8*(6^4) + 0.2*(5^4) ] = sigma [0.8 * 1296 + 0.2 *625 ].

Calculate each term:

0.8 * 1296 = 1036.8

0.2 * 625 = 125

So F = sigma (1036.8 + 125 ) = sigma * 1161.8.

F0 is sigma * 1296.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F = 1161.8 sigma.

When the unspotted hemisphere is visible, F = 1296 sigma.

So the amplitude is (1296 - 1161.8) sigma = 134.2 sigma.

Wait, but wait, when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is less than F0. So the amplitude is the difference, which is 134.2 sigma. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the brightness variation is similar to that of a planet transiting. So for the planet transit scenario, the amplitude is the drop in flux when the planet is in front.

The transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2 * F0.

So the amplitude for the planet is (R_planet / R_star)^2 * F0.

Wait, no. The star's flux without the planet is F0. When the planet transits, it blocks some of the flux, so the observed flux is F0 - (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) F0.

So the amplitude is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) F0.

So in the problem, the two amplitudes (from spots and from planet) are the same.

So (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) F0 = amplitude from spots.

The amplitude from spots is 134.2 sigma.

Wait, but F0 is sigma * 6000^4 = sigma * 1296.

So 134.2 sigma is 134.2/1296 F0.

Wait, no, because F0 is sigma * 6000^4. So 134.2 sigma is (134.2 / 1296 ) * F0.

Wait, so the amplitude from the spots is 134.2 sigma, and the amplitude from the planet is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) F0.

But F0 = sigma * 6000^4, so (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) * sigma * 6000^4 = 134.2 sigma.

We can cancel sigma on both sides.

So (R_planet^2 / R_star^2 ) * 6000^4 = 134.2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because F0 is 6000^4 sigma, and the amplitude from the spots is 134.2 sigma.

Wait, the planet's amplitude is the drop in flux, which is (R_planet/R_star)^2 * F0 = (R_planet/R_star)^2 * sigma * 6000^4.

Set this equal to 134.2 sigma.

So,

(R_planet/R_star)^2 * sigma * 6000^4 = 134.2 sigma.

Cancel sigma,

(R_planet/R_star)^2 * 6000^4 = 134.2.

So,

(R_planet/R_star)^2 = 134.2 / (6000^4).

Wait, but 6000^4 is 6^4 * 1e4^4 = 1296 * 1e16? Wait, no, 6000 is 6e3, so 6e3^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Wait, no, 6000^4 = (6*10^3)^4 = 6^4 *10^(12) = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

So,

(R_planet/R_star)^2 = 134.2 / (1.296e15 ) = approximately 1.035e-13.

Taking the square root,

R_planet/R_star = sqrt(1.035e-13) ≈ 1.017e-6.5.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 1e-6 is 1 millionth, which is way smaller than any of the options given.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate the amplitude.

Wait, let's re-calculate the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

F = 0.8 * (6000^4) + 0.2 * (5000^4) = 0.8 * 1296 + 0.2 * 625 = 1036.8 + 125 = 1161.8.

F0 = 6000^4 = 1296.

So the flux when spots are visible is 1161.8 sigma, and when not, it's 1296 sigma.

So the amplitude is 1296 - 1161.8 = 134.2 sigma.

Wait, but when the star is viewed with the unspotted hemisphere, the flux is F0 = 1296 sigma.

When the spotted hemisphere is viewed, the flux is 1161.8 sigma.

So the amplitude (the change in brightness) is 134.2 sigma.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is 134.2 sigma.

But the planet transit depth is (R_p / R_star)^2 * F0.

So set (R_p / R_star)^2 * F0 = 134.2 sigma.

But F0 is sigma * Teff^4 = sigma * 1296.

So,

(R_p / R_star)^2 * sigma * 1296 = 134.2 sigma.

Cancel sigma,

(R_p / R_star)^2 * 1296 = 134.2.

So,

(R_p / R_star)^2 = 134.2 / 1296 ≈ 0.1036.

Taking square root,

R_p / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, that's about 0.32, which is option D.

Wait, but wait a minute. I thought the amplitude from the spots was 134.2 sigma, which is the change in flux. But for the planet, the flux drop is (R_p^2 / R_star^2) F0.

Ah, but I think I made a mistake in the sign earlier. The amplitude from the spots is the difference in brightness between when the spots are visible and when they're not. So F when spots are visible is 1161.8 sigma, and F0 is 1296 sigma. So the star's brightness drops by 134.2 sigma when the spots are visible.

The planet transit causes a drop in brightness of (R_p^2 / R_star^2) F0.

So the amplitude (the drop) is the same for both cases.

So, (R_p^2 / R_star^2) F0 = 134.2 sigma.

And F0 is sigma * 6000^4 = sigma * 1296.

So,

(R_p^2 / R_star^2) * sigma * 1296 = 134.2 sigma.

Cancel sigma,

(R_p^2 / R_star^2) * 1296 = 134.2.

So,

(R_p^2 / R_star^2) = 134.2 / 1296 ≈ 0.1036.

Then,

R_p / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.1036) ≈ 0.322.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but why is the planet radius 0.32 times the star's radius? That's a huge planet. Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun. So 0.32 is about 3 times Jupiter's radius. That seems a bit large, but perhaps it's possible.

But wait, let me think again. The problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun. So R_star = R_sun. Jupiter's radius is about 0.1 R_sun, so 0.32 R_sun is a very large planet, perhaps a brown dwarf? But in exoplanet terms, such a large planet would be considered, but the question is about the calculation.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

F when spots are visible: 0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 = 0.8*1296 + 0.2*625 = 1036.8 + 125 = 1161.8.

F0 is 1296.

So the amplitude (change) is 1296 - 1161.8 = 134.2 sigma.

So setting that equal to the transit depth.

Transit depth is (R_p^2/R_star^2) * F0.

Wait, F0 is 1296 sigma. So,

(R_p^2 / R_star^2 ) * 1296 sigma = 134.2 sigma.

So,

(R_p^2 / R_star^2 ) = 134.2 / 1296 ≈ 0.1036.

Take the square root,

R_p/R_star ≈ 0.3218, which rounds to 0.32.

So the answer is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a **filling factor** of 20% (\( f = 0.2 \)).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The total flux from the star without spots is:
     \[
     F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 = \sigma (6000)^4 = \sigma (1296).
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (1 - f) F_0 + f F_{\text{spots}},
     \]
     where \( F_{\text{spots}} = \sigma (5000)^4 = \sigma (625) \). Substituting:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = 0.8 \cdot 1296 + 0.2 \cdot 625 = 1036.8 + 125 = 1161.8 \, \sigma.
     \]
   - The amplitude of brightness variation is the difference between the flux when no spots are visible (\( F_0 \)) and when spots are visible (\( F_{\text{spotty}} \)):
     \[
     \Delta F = F_0 - F_{\text{spotty}} = 1296 - 1161.8 = 134.2 \, \sigma.
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation Due to a Planet Transit**:
   - When a planet transits the star, the observed flux drop is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 F_0.
     \]
   - Setting the amplitude of the planet transit equal to the amplitude caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 F_0 = \Delta F.
     \]
     Substituting \( F_0 = 1296 \, \sigma \) and \( \Delta F = 134.2 \, \sigma \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \cdot 1296 = 134.2.
     \]
     Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \frac{134.2}{1296} \approx 0.1036,
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1036} \approx 0.322.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). This corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
