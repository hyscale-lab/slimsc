Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism, as well as optical isomerism. It's a multiple-choice question with options A to D. Let me break it down.

So, the question has two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

I'll start by tackling part A. I remember that tautomerism involves the shifting of hydrogen and electrons between adjacent atoms, usually in a molecule with an acidic proton. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a molecule can switch between a keto form (with a carbonyl group) and an enol form (with an alcohol group).

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which I think has two ketone groups. Quinones are typically involved in enol tautomerism. For instance, p-benzoquinone can tautomerize between the keto and enol forms. So benzoquinone would show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So three carbonyl groups. Does this structure allow for any tautomerism? Well, tautomerism requires a conjugated system where a hydrogen can shift. In this case, the molecule has three ketone groups in a symmetrical arrangement. Each ketone is adjacent to another, but I'm not sure if they can shift. Wait, maybe the structure is such that each carbonyl is in a position that can't form an enol because the adjacent positions are already ketones. Alternatively, maybe the symmetry prevents tautomerism.

Wait, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is at every other carbon. So each CO is at C1, C3, C5. The ring is symmetrical. For a molecule to undergo enol tautomerism, there needs to be an alpha hydrogen (a hydrogen attached to the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl) that can shift. But in this case, each carbonyl is adjacent to another carbonyl. So the carbons next to each carbonyl are either carbonyls themselves or perhaps other groups.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the structure. The ring has six carbons. Each of the 1,3,5 positions are carbonyls. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C, but in a ring. So each carbon with a carbonyl group is attached to two other carbons (since it's a six-membered ring). So each carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbons are CH groups. Wait, but each of those CH groups is adjacent to another carbonyl. So for example, the carbon at position 2 is between C1 (CO) and C3 (CO). So C2 would have two adjacent CO groups. Hmm.

Wait, if each of these positions has a carbonyl, then the adjacent carbons (like C2, C4, C6) are each connected to two carbonyl groups. So each of those would have a hydrogen attached. But for enol tautomerism, the hydrogen must be on an alpha carbon (adjacent to a carbonyl). So in this case, each of those C2, C4, C6 carbons have two carbonyl groups adjacent. So each has a hydrogen that can potentially shift.

But wait, can that happen? Let me think. For an enol to form, a hydrogen from an
