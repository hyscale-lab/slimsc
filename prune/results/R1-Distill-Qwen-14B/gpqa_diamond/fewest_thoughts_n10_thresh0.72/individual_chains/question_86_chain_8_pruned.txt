Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions with two unknown compounds, A and B. Each was treated with a different reducing agent. The products are both (R) and (S) forms of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The options give possible starting materials A and B, and I need to choose the correct pair.

Hmm... So each compound, A and B, when treated with a reducing agent, gives a specific enantiomer of the product. The key here is probably the stereochemistry of the starting material and how the reducing agents affect it.

Let me think about the reactions involved. The product is a six-membered ring, a tetrahydropyran-2-one with an ethyl group. The configuration at the chiral center is either R or S. So, the starting materials must have a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms this ring structure.

Wait, the starting materials are given as A and B. Let's look at the options. All options have the same structure for A and B except their configurations. They're all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acids. The only difference is whether they're S or R configurations.

So the starting compounds are pentanoic acid derivatives with an oxo group (a ketone) at position 5 and an isobutoxy group as well. When reduced, they form the tetrahydropyranone.

Wait, how does the reduction work here? I think the reducing agents could be LiBH4 and BH3. But wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used for ketones as well, but maybe in different conditions or in different reactions.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm thinking about something else. I remember that LiAlH4 is used for reductions, but LiBH4 is also a reducing agent. Oh, but wait, wait. Another possibility: the reducing agents are used in different conditions that lead to different stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, but both reactions produce a ring, so perhaps the starting material has an ester group which, when reduced, forms a diol or something that cyclizes into a ring. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the starting materials are
