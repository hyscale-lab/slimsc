Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's give it a shot.

Alright, the problem is about a star and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does.

First, let me jot down the given information. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but why does the Teff drop when spots are present? I remember that sunspots are cooler regions on the Sun's surface. So when a significant portion is covered by these cooler spots, the overall effective temperature of the star decreases. That makes sense.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio N1/N2, where N1 is the number in level 1 and N2 in level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near-ultraviolet range, I think.

The question asks for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So factor = (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Hmm. Since the ratio decreases when there are spots, that means (N1/N2)_no_spots is larger than (N1/N2)_with_spots. So the factor should be greater than 1.

I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy) and E is the energy difference.

So the ratio depends on the temperature and the energy difference
