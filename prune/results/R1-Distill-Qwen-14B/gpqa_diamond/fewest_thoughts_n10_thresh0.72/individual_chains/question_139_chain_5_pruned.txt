Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right starting materials that lead to two different diketones when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

The question states that compounds A and B each react under these conditions to form specific diketones. The products are 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione and 5-methylhexane-2,3-dione. So, I need to find what A and B were before the reaction.

Wait a second, the reagents used are NaNO2, HCl, and H2O. That combination rings a bell. I remember that when you treat a ketone with nitrous acid (which is generated from NaNO2 and HCl), it can lead to the formation of a geminal diol. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, another reaction. Oh right! The Stephen reduction or maybe the formation of a nitro compound? Or wait, maybe it's the cyanohydrin reaction? No, that's with CN-.

Wait, no, wait. Another thought: when a carbonyl group is treated with HNO2 (nitrous acid), it can undergo a reaction called the hydroxyamination, but that forms an oxime. Oh wait, but the conditions here are more like HCl and NaNO2, which is used in the production of diazonium salts. Oh, but wait, this is when dealing with aromatic amines. But in this case, the starting materials are aliphatic, so maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle. I recall that when a ketone is treated with a mixture of HCl, NaNO2, and water, it might undergo a reaction called the "Bayer-Villiger" oxidation, but that's not right because that involves inserting an oxygen adjacent to the ketone. No, more likely, I'm thinking about the formation of a geminal diol. Oh wait, if the carbonyl is treated with something like H2O, but under acidic conditions, maybe it's a pinacol-like reaction? Not exactly, because pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol.

Wait, perhaps it's the oxidation of an alcohol to a
