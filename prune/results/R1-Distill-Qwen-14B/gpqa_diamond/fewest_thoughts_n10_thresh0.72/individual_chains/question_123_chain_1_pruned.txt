Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's a supernova in our galaxy, and part of its ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm. So I think this is a problem involving relative velocity and maybe time dilation or length contraction? Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's just about special relativity, specifically relative motion and possibly Lorentz transformations.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, from the ejecta's perspective, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. But from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. But in reality, since both are inertial frames, the speed is the same in opposite directions.

Wait, but how do we find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame over 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame? Hmm. So, perhaps this is a case of time transformation between frames.

Wait, I remember
