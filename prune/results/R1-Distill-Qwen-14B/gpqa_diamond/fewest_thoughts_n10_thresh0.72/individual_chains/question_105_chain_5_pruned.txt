Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is about how the brightness variation caused by these spots compares to the variation caused by a planet. They want to know what the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet should be to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve.

Hmm, right. I remember that when a planet passes in front of a star (transit), it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But in this case, the star itself is variable because of the spots. So I need to figure out what the equivalent would be in terms of a planet's size.

Wait, the question says that in the case where there's no spots, what planet radius would give the same amplitude. So the spot-induced variation is similar to a planet's effect, but we need to find that planet's radius.

Let me think about the star's brightness variation due to the spots. The star's brightness comes from its entire surface, but when spots rotate into and out of view, the observed flux changes. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star looks dimmer.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so the spot temperature is 5000K. The filling factor is 20%, meaning that each hemisphere's spots cover 20% of its surface. Wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered with spots. Oh, and the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the entire star would have 10% of its surface covered by spots because only one hemisphere is spotty. Or wait, no, because a hemisphere is half the star, so 20% of a hemisphere—so 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, so 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if one hemisphere has 20% coverage, the total area covered is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere). The entire star's area is 4πR². Hemisphere is 2πR². So 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spot area is 0.4πR².

Wait, so the spots cover 0.4πR² of the star, which is 0.4/(4) = 0.1, 10% of the star's surface. Got it.

The flux from the star is normally based on its entire surface. The star emits with a certain flux, and the spots contribute less. So when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the observed flux is lower. The variation in flux depends on how much area is
