Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the given data includes phase shifts for different angular momentum states. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The problem specifies to ignore the rest, so I guess we're only considering up to l=4 here.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(lθ) ) ). Oh wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. The incident direction is θ=0 degrees, right?

So when θ is zero, what happens? Because sin(lθ) becomes sin(0) which is zero for any l. But wait, that can't be right because the amplitude wouldn't be zero. Oh wait, maybe I'm thinking of the real and imaginary parts differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that the scattering amplitude can be written in terms of partial waves. 

Wait, I think the general form is f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l [ (2l+1) (δ_{m,0} + something) ] but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, considering that the problem is asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction, which is along θ=0. So the scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 might be related to the sum of the phase shifts.

Another approach: The total cross-section is related to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. Oh wait, the optical theorem! The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to (4π/k²) times the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude f(0). 

So, σ_total = (4π/k²) * Im(f(0)). Therefore, if
