Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm going to try to think through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

Now, the question is asking: What Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls instead?

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to how much time dilation and length contraction occurs in special relativity. But wait, how does this apply to the problem here? The particles are moving from the center to the walls of the detector. So the distance they need to travel is 30 meters. The time they take to do this would determine whether they decay before reaching the wall.

I think the key here is the concept of proper time and the lab frame time. The particles have a certain proper lifetime, and in the lab frame, their lifetime is dilated by the Lorentz factor gamma. So, if the lab frame lifetime is longer, the particles can travel a longer distance before decaying.

Wait, but how does this relate to the fraction reaching the detector walls? Oh right, the particles that reach the wall are those that don't decay before traveling the 30 meters. So, the probability depends on whether the particle's lifetime (as seen in the lab) is enough for it to reach the wall.

I think the formula I need is the one involving the proper lifetime and the observed lifetime. The proper lifetime, tau, is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau.

So, the particles will reach the wall if their lifetime in the lab frame is greater than the time it takes to travel 30 meters at their speed. Let me write that down.

The time taken to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. The speed of the particles is ultra-relativistic, so I can approximate it as the speed of light, c. So, t = 30 meters / c.

But since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their speed is approximately c. So, t â‰ˆ
