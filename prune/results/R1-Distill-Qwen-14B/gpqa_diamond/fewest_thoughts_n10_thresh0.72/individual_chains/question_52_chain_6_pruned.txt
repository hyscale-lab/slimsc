Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, the scenario is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So I think this involves the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a star's atmosphere. The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp(- (E_i - E_j) / (k*T)), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels. Let me denote level 1 as the lower energy level and level 2 as the higher one. So, ratio R = n1/n2. Oh wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. Which means when the star has spots (cooler), the ratio R is lower than when it's without spots (hotter).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: in a hotter star, the atoms are more likely to be excited to higher energy levels. So if the star is hotter without spots, the higher energy level (level 2) would be more populated. So the ratio n1/n2 would be lower when the star is hotter. Wait no, because if level 2 is higher energy, then higher temperature means more atoms can be excited to it, so n2 increases, making n1/n2 decrease. So when the star has spots, it's cooler, so fewer atoms in higher levels. So n2 decreases, which means the ratio n1/n2 would increase. But the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that's conflicting with my initial thought.

Wait, maybe I got the levels wrong. Let's clarify: the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range (since 1448 is less than 4000 Å). So Ti I (neutral Ti) has a line at around 1448 Å. Let me think about the ionization balance. Neutral Ti would have some excitation levels. The transition is from a lower to a higher energy level or vice versa? Well, when an atom absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower to a higher energy level. So the transition corresponds to a photon emitted when an atom drops from level 2 to level 1. So level 2 is higher in energy than level 1.

So in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of n1 to n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Because the equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So for a higher temperature, the exponential term increases, making n1/n2 larger. That would imply that when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases. So when the star has spots (cooler), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when it's without spots (hotter). But the question states that the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, that matches because without spots, T is higher, so the ratio n1/n2 is higher. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower.

The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So factor = (n1/n
