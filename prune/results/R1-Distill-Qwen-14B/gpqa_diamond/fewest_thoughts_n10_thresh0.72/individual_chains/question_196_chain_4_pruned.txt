Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. Normally, in non-relativistic physics, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But since this is relativistic, things are a bit more complicated.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1D oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the force is like a spring. But we're considering relativity here, so energy equations will involve relativistic terms.

I remember that in special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does this apply to the oscillator?

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the potential energy at maximum amplitude A is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at maximum speed would be the same, so setting (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA² gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But relativity probably changes this.

Wait, the options have some terms involving c. So the maximum speed can't exceed c. But in the options, some have c multiplied, others have v_max expressions that might approach c.

Let me think about the energy. The
