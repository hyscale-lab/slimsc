Okay, so I need to figure out the correct products of these Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, let's look at reaction A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester, so the enolate can form easily. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so it's the Michael acceptor here.

In the Michael addition, the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. So, the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. The product would have the malonate group attached to the acrylate. The structure after addition would have the new bond formed at the beta position, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, the molecule would undergo a deprotonation and possibly some rearrangement.

Wait, but the product is a tricarboxylate. Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO2)2CH-, so when it adds to the acrylate, the structure would have three carboxylate groups. Let me imagine: the acrylate is CH2=CH-C6H4- (p-tolyl) with a methyl ester. The malonate adds across the double bond. So the product would be something like CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-C6H4-CH2-CO2Me? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)CO2Me. So when the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is the conjugate base of CH2(CO2Me)2-) attacks the beta carbon, the structure becomes CH2(CO2Me)2-CH2-C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CO2Me? Or maybe the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO2Me with a p-tolyl group on the alpha? Wait, no. The structure is probably CH2=C(p-tolyl)CH2CO2Me? No, wait, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-(C6H4-p-tolyl)-CO2Me? Wait, no. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So it's CH2=CH-C(C6H4-p-t
