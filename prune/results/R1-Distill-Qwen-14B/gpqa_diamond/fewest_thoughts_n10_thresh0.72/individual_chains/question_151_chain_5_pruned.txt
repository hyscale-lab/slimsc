Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says the state of the system is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that means the state vector is a 3x1 matrix. So, the state vector |ψ> is [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized, right? The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should equal 1. Let me check that.

So, the components are -1, 2, 1. The squares of their magnitudes are (-1)^2 =1, 2^2=4, 1^2=1. Sum is 1+4+1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). That means the state isn't normalized. But I think when calculating probabilities, we need the normalized state. So, I should normalize it first.

So, the normalized state would be each component divided by sqrt(6). So, |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1; 2; 1]. Got it.

Next, the observable is represented by matrix P. The matrix has three rows. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. I'm trying to remember, in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators, right? So I should check if P is Hermitian. Because only Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues, which correspond to possible measurement outcomes.

Looking at P:

First row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2),0]

So, for P to be Hermitian, the matrix should equal its conjugate transpose. Since all the elements are real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me check if P is symmetric.

Looking at the elements:

P[1][2] = 1/sqrt(2), P[2][1] =1/sqrt(2) → same. P[2][3] is 1/sqrt(2), and P[3][2] is 1/sqrt(2) → same. The diagonal elements are all zero. So yes, it's symmetric. So P is Hermitian. Good, that makes sense.

The question is about the probability of measuring 0 when we measure the observable P. So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which ones are zero, then find the eigenvectors, project the state onto those eigenvectors, and find the probability.

Alternatively, I remember that the expectation value of an operator P is given by <ψ| P |ψ>, but that's not directly the same as the probability. Wait, but for the probability of
