Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in three dimensions, the harmonic oscillator is often treated in terms of the quantum numbers for each degree of freedom.

Wait, the question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (eigenstates) for that energy. So I need to figure out what the energy is and how many states have that energy.

I think the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. Alternatively, since the oscillator is isotropic, it's often easier to think in terms of the total quantum number. Oh right, another way to write the energy is E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So n is the sum of the three quantum numbers.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, in 3D, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω to the energy, so the total is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2). Alternatively, n = n_x + n_y + n_z, so E = ħω (n + 3/2).

But wait, the third excited state. Oh, I need to clarify: in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which would be n=0 (n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0). The first excited state would be n=1, the second n=2, and the third would be n=3. So the third excited state is E with n=3? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing zero-based counting here. Let me think again.

The ground state is the lowest, which is n=0. The first excited state is n=1, the second is n=2, third is n=3. So yeah, the third excited state is n=3. So the energy would be (3
