Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density among the options given. The options are labeled a to d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Wait, no, the options are given as a, b, c, d, and the answer choices are A, B, C, D, each pointing to one of these. So I need to figure out which of a, b, c, d has the highest density, then see which letter (A-D) corresponds to that.

Let me parse each option:

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth in both mass and radius. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I think. So this planet would have the same density as Earth.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Oh wait, the density is given here. So this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth. So it's more massive, but same density. So its radius would be larger than Earth's, because mass scales with radius cubed (since mass is proportional to volume, which is radius^3). But density is mass/volume, so same density implies same mass-to-radius ratio.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So same composition implies same density as Earth, right? Because density is based on composition. So if it's made of the same materials as Earth, its density would be same as Earth's. But wait, does that hold? Because if the mass increases but the radius increases proportionally, but composition determines density. So if it's 5x the mass, but radius is cube root of 5 times Earth's radius? Because mass scales with radius^3. So Earth's mass is M, radius R. So 5M would be (R * cube_root(5))^3. So it would have a larger radius, but same density. So same density as Earth. So density is 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So again, same density. Because same composition. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet would also have that.
