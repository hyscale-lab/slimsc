Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, and it's radiating power. Hmm.

Alright, the setup: the charge distribution is spheroidal, so I think that implies some sort of symmetry, probably like an ellipsoid but oscillating. The oscillation makes it radiate, right? The problem mentions a wavelength lambda for the radiation. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. 

The question is asking about two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f in terms of lambda. The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a lambda dependence.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they radiate electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern depends on the type of dipole or higher-order moments involved. Since it's a spheroid, maybe it's an electric dipole or magnetic dipole? Well, spheroidal symmetry makes me think it's an electric dipole. Wait, or maybe it's a quadrupole? No, I think spheroidal shape with oscillation along the axis would make it an electric dipole. Because a dipole has two poles, and spheroidal symmetry along the axis would fit that.

In dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle depends on the angle theta. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum along the axis (theta=0 and theta=180, or theta=pi) and minimum in the plane (theta=90 degrees). Wait, no, wait a second. No, wait. For a dipole, the radiation is maximum perpendicular to the axis, right? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think. The dipole's radiation pattern in the far field: the intensity (power per unit area) depends on the angle. The intensity is proportional to (sin theta)^2, but wait, no. Wait, I think the radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at theta = 90 degrees (perpendicular to the dipole axis), because that's when the components of the dipole's fields contribute most strongly. So the
