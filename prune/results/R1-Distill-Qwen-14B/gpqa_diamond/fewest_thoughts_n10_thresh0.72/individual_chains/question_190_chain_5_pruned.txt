Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solutions. Hmm, I need to arrange these nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive. Let me think about what I remember from my ochem class.

The compounds listed are: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate. I need to order them 1 to 5.

Wait, nucleophilicity depends on a few factors. In a polar aprotic solvent, larger and less solvated ions are better nucleophiles. But since the question says aqueous solution, that's a polar protic solvent. So solvation plays a big role here. The more a nucleophile is stabilized (solvated) by the solvent, the less reactive it is.

So in polar protic solvents, the strength of the nucleophile is inversely related to how well it's solvated. So weaker bases are better nucleophiles in such solvents because they're less stabilized.

Let me list each nucleophile and think about their strength:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: This is a conjugate base of an alcohol. Alkoxide ions are strong bases. But cyclohexanol is a relatively bulky alcohol. Wait, but in this case, the cyclohexanolate is an alkoxide, so it's a strong base. But in aqueous solution, it's going to be heavily solvated because it's a strong base. So maybe it's not the strongest nucleophile here.

2. Hydroxide (OH-): Also a strong base. In water, it's very solvated, so its nucleophilicity might be lower than a weaker base but more nucleophilic? Wait, I'm getting confused. I remember that in water, iodide is a better nucleophile than hydroxide because OH- is a stronger base and gets more solvated. So OH- might not be the best nucleophile in this list.

Wait, but let's think about each one's basicity. Stronger bases are more likely to be poor nucleophiles in polar protic solvents because they're more stabilized by solvation.

3. Propionate (CH2CH2COO-): This is the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base than hydroxide or alkoxides because it's a carboxylate. Carboxylate ions are resonance stabilized, so they're weaker bases. So in aqueous solution, because they're weaker bases, they're less solvated, hence more nucleophilic.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait a second. Actually, in polar protic solvents, it's the opposite. Because the more basic the species, the more it's stabilized (solvated) by the solvent. So weaker bases are less stabilized, so more available to attack, making them better nucleophiles.

Wait, I might be mixing it up. Let me think again: in polar aprotic solvents, it's the inherent nucleophilicity, so stronger bases are better nucleophiles. But in polar protic, because of solvation, weaker bases are better nucleophiles.

Wait, so that would mean that a weaker base is more nucleophilic in polar protic solvents. Because the strong bases get heavily solvated, making them less reactive.

So let's list the nucleophiles in order of their basicity. The weaker the base, the better the nucleophile in aqueous solution.

So:

Ethanethiolate (CH2CH2S-): Thiolates are stronger bases than the corresponding oxygen ones because sulfur is larger, so the conjugate base is more stabilized? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the thiolate ion is a stronger base than the hydroxide ion. Because H2S is a weaker acid than water, so its conjugate base is stronger. Wait, no. Wait, H2S is a weaker acid than H2O. So, in water, H2O is a stronger acid than H2S. So, the conjugate base of H2O is weaker than the conjugate base of H2S.
