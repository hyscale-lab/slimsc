Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh wait, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So I should probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of energy levels in a thermal distribution. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Since we're comparing two energy levels, let's say E_2 and E_1, where E_2 is higher than E_1 (because the atoms are excited to a higher level). So the ratio would be the population of the higher level to the lower level.

In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Wait, does that mean the ratio n_upper/n_lower is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Or wait, maybe the excitation is higher when the population is higher. So perhaps the excitation level is proportional to the population in the higher state. Let me think: if in star 1, the excited state is twice as much as in star 2, then n_1_upper / n_1_lower = 2, and n_2_upper / n_2_lower = 1? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is higher than that of star_2. Let me think again. So for star_1, the population is twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So perhaps the ratio n_upper / n_lower is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2? Or wait, maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 and the same ratio for star_2 would be different.

Wait, no. Let's clarify.
