Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. Hmm, let's break it down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on my reactions.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. Then, it's treated with bromine to form product 1. Wait, bromine adding to a ketone? Oh right, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine (Br2) to a ketone, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. But wait, no, waitâ€”bromine can also undergo addition in other ways. Oh, wait! Wait a second. Oh, I think I might be mixing things up. Wait, in the presence of a base, maybe it's a different reaction. Or perhaps it's an epoxidation? No, wait, that's with peracids. Oh wait, wait, wait. Oh, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, when you have a cyclic ketone like cyclohexanone and you add bromine (Br2), I think it's a dihalogenation. Oh right! The cyclohexanone, when treated with bromine in a certain condition, undergoes a 1,2-addition. So the bromine adds across the carbonyl group. So the product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, no, wait. Let me think about the mechanism. Br2 is a dienophile in some cases, but for a ketone, it would add across the C=O. The carbonyl oxygen is electron-withdrawing, so the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are more reactive. Oh, wait, actually, in the case of cyc
