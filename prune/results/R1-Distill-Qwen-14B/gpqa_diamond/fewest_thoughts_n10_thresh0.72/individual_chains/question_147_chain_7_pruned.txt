Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about annihilation. Hmm, let's see. The reaction given is a proton and an antiproton annihilating to produce two positive and two negative particles, called A+ and A-. The antiproton is moving slowly, so I think that means its speed is much less than the speed of light, maybe non-relativistic? Or wait, no, because the products are particles, so maybe I should consider relativistic effects. Oh well, I'll think about it step by step.

The mass of particle A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. Wait, that's the rest mass energy, right? So m_A is 300 MeV divided by c squared, but maybe I don't need to compute that exactly yet.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are all fractions of the speed of light, so I think I need to find v in terms of c. 

I remember that in particle reactions, conservation laws apply: conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is not too high, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the setup.

So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Their rest masses are the same, right? Because a proton and antiproton have the same mass. So the proton has mass m_p c², same as the antiproton. Let me check, I think the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which might mean that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. But since it's an annihilation process, maybe the initial kinetic energy is small compared to the rest mass energy of the particles involved.

Wait, but in annihilation, protons and antiprotons annihilate into other particles. So the initial total energy would be the sum of their rest energies plus any kinetic energy. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. But I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial kinetic energy is considered, but I might need to set up the conservation equations.

So, the initial setup: the proton is probably at rest? Or maybe both are moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, but it doesn't say anything about the proton. Oh, wait, in the problem statement, it's
