Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. The options are A, B, C, D. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes are heated, especially with certain structures, they can undergo a reaction called elimination or perhaps a rearrangement. Wait, wait, isn't there something like the Cope rearrangement or maybe a hydride shift involved in these cases?

Let me think. The starting molecule is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Breaking that down, "nona" means nine carbons. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, nona-2,6-diene is nine carbons with double bonds at 2 and 6. So positions 2-3 and 6-7 are double bonds. The substituent is butyl at position 5. So the structure might be:

1   2   3   4   5      6   7   8   9
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, but the butyl is at position 5, which is the
