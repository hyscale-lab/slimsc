Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the net potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

So the setup is: there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of this system.

Wait, what do I know about potential energy in such configurations? I remember that when you bring charges together, the potential energy is related to the work done against the electric field. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that might change things.

Grounded means the sphere is connected to the earth, so any excess charge can go to the ground. Oh wait, but in this case, the charge q is placed nearby. So when I bring charge q near the sphere, it induces charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is conducting, the charges will redistribute. Grounding would cause any induced charges to flow away, but wait, the charge q is the one being placed, so maybe the sphere's induced charges are such that the total charge on the sphere remains zero.

Wait no, not quite. I think when you bring a charge q near a conducting sphere, the sphere's surface will have induced charges. But because the sphere is grounded, the charges can leave, so the induced charges on the sphere would adjust until the potential on the sphere is the same as the ground. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. So when I place charge q at a distance
