Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it carefully.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of different benzene derivatives with excess bromine. Each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative, but the focus here is on the weight fraction of the para-isomer in each case. We need to arrange the substances 1-6 in order of increasing para-isomer yield.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring determine where the bromine adds. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) activate the ring and direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) deactivate the ring and also direct based on their nature.

Let me list the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an EDG because of the +I effect (it's an alkyl group). EDGs are ortho/para directors. So bromine can add at ortho, meta, or para positions, but in the case of a monobromo derivative, the major product is a mixture. Wait, noâ€”wait, when the substituent is activating, the ring is more reactive, and the substituent directs the incoming group to ortho and para positions. But in the case of a single substitution, the major product might be a mix of ortho, para, and some meta, but for the purpose of this question, each reaction forms only one monobromo product. Hmm, maybe the question is about the ratio of the para isomer to the others?

Wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, perhaps each substitution leads to a single product because of the structure of the molecule. But that doesn't make sense, because for example, methyl benzene (toluene) can brominate at multiple positions. Wait, no, maybe in this case, the substituents are such that only one position is possible for substitution? Like in some cases, perhaps the substituent is such that it can only add in a specific position (maybe due to steric hindrance or directing effects making one position dominant). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps each reaction gives a mixture, but the question is about the proportion of the para-isomer.

Wait, the question says "the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer." So for each compound, when bromine is added, what's the percentage of the para product.

So, the substituents in each case:

1) CH3 (methyl): EDG, o/p director. So para is a major product, along with ortho.

2) COOEt (ethoxycarbonyl): This is an EWG because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Moreover, the ester group is a meta director. So the substituent directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. So the major product would be meta, so para would be minor. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, the substituent is -COOEt. So in that case, for substitution, it's a meta director. So when you brominate,
