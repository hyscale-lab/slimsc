Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's read it again carefully.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. I remember that the stability constant (β) indicates how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, for each complex, the β tells us how much the ions will form that complex.

The Co(II) can form complexes with thiocyanate. The possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n is the number of SCN- ions attached. The complexes are Co(SCN)^-, Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, Co(SCN)4^−, etc. Wait, but the stability constants given are β1 to β4. So, I think β1 is for the first complex (monothiocyanato), β2 for the second (dithiocyanato), and so on.

Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant βn for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For example, for the first complex, it's [Co(SCN)]+ → Co^2+ + SCN^-; the β would be [Co(SCN)]+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ). So, the higher the β, the more the complex will form.

So, the problem is about the distribution of Co species in solution. The species present are Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3]^−, [Co(SCN)4]^−, etc. But wait, the problem mentions the "blue dithiocyanato" complex. I remember that [Co(SCN)2] is blue, so that's the species we're interested in.

So, the question is to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2] (the second complex) relative to all cobalt species. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all
