Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. And the pH is ideal, temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. Hmm, right, 25Â°C is standard, so I probably don't need to worry about temperature affecting the K value.

Wait, what do I remember about EDTA and complexes? EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex must be something like CaY^2-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant K is for the reaction where Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- form the complex.

So the formation constant K is given by the equation:

K = [CaY^2+] / ( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonation states. The problem says the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its Y^4- form. Because EDTA can lose protons depending on the pH, and Y^4- is the active form for complexation. So I can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the total concentration of free EDTA. That simplifies things because I don't have to account for the various protonated forms.

But in this problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaY^2+] = 0.02 M.

Wait, but since the solution is stoichiometric, I think that implies that all the Ca^2+ is in the form of the CaY^2+ complex. So [CaY^2+] = 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] would be very low because it's mostly tied up in the complex.

The question is to find the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions in solution, right?

So the K expression is K = [CaY^2+] / ( [Ca
