Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think this through carefully.

So the compound given is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait. Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Hmm. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Oh, wait, benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, maybe the formula is written as C6H4BrD, meaning benzene with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. Or perhaps it's a benzene ring with a Br at position 1 and a CH2D group? No, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. Oh, but the way it's written, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, perhaps it's benzene with a Br at position 1 and a D (deuterium) at position 2. So the structure would have Br at position 1, and a hydrogen replaced by deuterium at position 2.

The reaction is treatment with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, what does that do? I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. In aromatic chemistry, especially for benzene rings, NaNH2 is used for various substitution reactions, maybe like in the formation of benzene rings with strong deprotonation.

Wait, but wait. If we have a benzene ring with Br and D, and we're using a strong base, perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination reaction. Or maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, but bromobenzene is usually not very reactive towards substitution unless under specific conditions. But wait, maybe it's a case of aromatic substitution. Alternatively, could this be a dehalogenation reaction? Wait, in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps an elimination occurs, but bromobenzene doesn't typically eliminate because it's not adjacent to any leaving groups or anything like that. Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring undergoing some kind of substitution. Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is playing a role here.

Wait, another thought: maybe this is a case of the benzene ring undergoing a C-H deprotonation. So, NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate certain aromatic positions. But the positions where deprotonation occurs would depend on the substituents on the ring.

Wait, the substituents in this case are Br and D. So, Br is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) which deactivates the ring. It directs incoming electrophiles to the meta positions. But deprotonation is a base-induced process, so perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's in a position that's activated for such a reaction.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the base is NaNH2, which is a strong base, but perhaps it's also a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in elimination.

Wait, another angle: when benzene has a substituent like Br and a D, perhaps in this reaction, the Br could be replaced by something else. But what? Since NaNH2 is a source of NH2^- ions, perhaps a substitution reaction occurs where Br is replaced by NH2. But wait, that would involve an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution), which requires the ring to be activated towards nucleophilic attack.

But wait, Br is an EWG, which makes the ring more susceptible to nucleophilic substitution if it's in a meta-directing position. Wait, but for SNAr to occur, the ring must be activated, which usually requires a strong EWG in the right positions.

Wait, but in 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the substituents are Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So, if the Br is at position 1 (so, let's imagine the ring with positions 1, 2, etc., as per typical numbering), then the adjacent position is 2. So, positions 3 and 5 would be meta relative to Br.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the structure: position 1 is Br, position 2 is D. So, the ring is numbered such that

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, right, that's bromobenzene with a deuterium substitution. Or wait, maybe the "d" stands for something else. Oh, perhaps it's a typo, and it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should focus on the reaction part.

So, NaNH2 is a strong base, and when it's used in ammonia, that's usually a deprotonation reaction. Wait, but where are the protons that could be abstracted here? Let me think about the structure. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, perhaps the "d" is a substituent. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2.

Wait, but 1-bromobenzene-2-d, does that make sense? Let me draw the benzene ring. Positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. So bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. So the benzene ring has Br at C1 and D (deuterium) at C2.

Now, when NaNH2 is used in ammonia, it's typically for de
