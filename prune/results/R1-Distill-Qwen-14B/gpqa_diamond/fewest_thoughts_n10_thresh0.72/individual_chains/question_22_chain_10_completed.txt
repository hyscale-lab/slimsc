Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the oxidizing strength and reaction kinetics of oxygen in different solutions—basic versus acidic. 

Let me start by recalling what I know about oxygen as an oxidizing agent. I remember that in electrochemical reactions, the strength of an oxidizing agent depends on its tendency to gain electrons, right? So the more it wants to gain electrons (be reduced), the stronger the oxidizing agent it is.

Oxygen in acidic solutions... I think about the standard reduction potentials. Oh right, the reaction for oxygen in acidic conditions is O2 + 4H+ + 2e- → 2H2O. The standard potential for this is about +1.23 V. In basic solutions, the same oxygen would react with water instead of H+ ions, so the reaction is O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-. The standard potential for that is around +0.40 V. Wait, so in acidic solution, the potential is higher, meaning the oxidizing power is stronger there. So thermodynamically, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions. But the first part of the question says, in basic solutions. Oh wait, the question says, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So in basic, it's a weaker oxidant compared to acidic. That makes sense because the E° is lower in basic. So the first blank would be 'weaker'.

Now, the second part is about kinetics. Kinetically, how does oxygen react in acidic vs. basic solutions? I remember that kinetics can be influenced by factors like concentration of ions, which might affect the reaction rate. In acidic solutions, the H+ ions are present in higher concentration. But wait, in the case of oxygen, maybe the reaction in acidic conditions is faster because the reaction might proceed more easily with the H+ present. Alternatively, I think about the role of catalysts or the rate of electron transfer. Oh, wait, in acidic solutions, oxygen can react more readily because the reaction O2 + 4H+ + 2e- → 2H2O might have a lower activation energy when H+ is available. 

But wait, another thought: sometimes, in more dilute solutions, reactions can be slower because ions are less concentrated. But in acidic solutions, H+ is higher, which could make the solution more conductive and perhaps increase the reaction rate. Alternatively, maybe the presence of H+ stabilizes intermediates or something. Hmm. Alternatively, I remember that in acidic conditions, the reaction might proceed faster because the protons help in the reaction mechanism, perhaps lowering the activation energy. So oxygen would react faster in acidic solutions than in basic.

Putting it all together: the first blank is 'weaker' (because basic has lower E°, so weaker oxidant) and the second part is 'faster' (because in acidic, the reaction is kinetically faster). So the combination is weaker and faster.

Looking at the options, option C is weaker – faster. Option C is: weaker – faster. So the correct option is C.


Thermodynamically, the oxidizing strength of oxygen depends on its standard reduction potential. In acidic solutions, the reaction is \( \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 2\text{e}^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \), with a standard potential of \( +1.23 \, \text{V} \). In basic solutions, the reaction is \( \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4\text{e}^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \), with a standard potential of \( +0.40 \, \text{V} \). Since the potential is lower in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

Kinetically, the reaction rate is influenced by factors such as ion concentration and activation energy. In acidic solutions, the higher concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions can facilitate the reaction, potentially lowering the activation energy and making the reaction faster. Therefore, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions than in basic solutions.

Combining these observations, oxygen is a weaker oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions and reacts faster kinetically in acidic solutions. The correct combination is "weaker – faster," corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
