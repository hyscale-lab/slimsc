Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The state given is |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh right, N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). So first, I should probably figure out what the density matrix rho looks like for this state. The density matrix is |psi><psi|.

Wait, but the problem mentions using relative entropy measure del_b, which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state. So the non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropies of the non-Gaussian state rho and the Gaussian state tau.

But wait, what's a Gaussian state here? Oh, I remember that coherent states, squeezed states, and thermal states are Gaussian. The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian. The reference Gaussian state tau is probably the closest Gaussian state to rho, maybe the one that minimizes the relative entropy. Or maybe it's the state that would result if the superpositions were Gaussian. Hmm, not entirely sure, but perhaps I should look for some known formula or approach.

Wait, another thought: For the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, sometimes people use the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. But in this case, the formula given is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). So del_b is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and that of tau. So nG is this difference.

Wait, but if tau is a Gaussian state, and rho is non-Gaussian, then if rho is a cat state, which I believe is highly non-Gaussian, the entropy difference would be positive. But I'm not sure how to compute this.

Wait, but perhaps for this specific case, the reference Gaussian state tau is the thermal state with the same average photon number as rho. Or maybe it's something else. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the cat state is a specific superposition, and the Gaussian reference might be a mixed state with the same parameters.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the state you get when phi is such that the cross terms vanish, making it a mixture of coherent states. Wait, but in this case, the state is a pure superposition, so the density matrix would be pure. The reference Gaussian state would be the state with the same first and second moments but in a Gaussian form.

Wait, maybe for a two-mode squeezed state, but no, this is a single-mode state. Hmm, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that is Gaussian and has the same first and second moments as rho.

Alternatively, maybe the relative entropy is being computed with respect to a specific Gaussian state, like a coherent state or a squeezed vacuum. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the cat state is a specific kind of state, so I can compute the entropies. Let me think about the state. The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N.

When phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) which is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha>]/N. So N is the normalization factor.

Let me compute N. N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, alpha is 0.5, phi is -pi/4.

Compute sin(2 phi): 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2. sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2 phi) is -1.

So N = sqrt( 1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2) )

Wait, exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is [ (sqrt(2)/2) |0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2) |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, okay, but how does this help me compute the non-Gaussianity?

Wait, the relative entropy measure del_b is the difference between the entropies of rho (non-Gaussian) and tau (Gaussian). So I need to compute S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy.

But how do I find tau? The problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. Maybe the reference is the state that is Gaussian and has the same expectation values as the cat state. Alternatively, perhaps it's the state that is the closest Gaussian approximation to rho.

Wait, but perhaps in this case, the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is Gaussian. Looking at the options, option D is 0. But the state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian, so nG shouldn't be zero. So D is not the answer.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe for certain parameters, the state becomes Gaussian. For example, when phi is such that the cross terms cancel out. Let me think: The given state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. The density matrix would be |psi><psi|, which would involve terms |alpha><alpha|, |-alpha><-alpha|, and cross terms |alpha><-alpha| and vice versa. So the state is a pure state, but the cross terms would be non-Gaussian. If these cross terms were absent, the state would be a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which is a Gaussian state.

But when would the cross terms be zero? Let me see: The coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi). So for the cross terms to be zero, either cos(phi) or sin(phi) must be zero. Wait, no, because the state is a superposition; the cross terms would not necessarily be zero unless phi is such that one of the coefficients is zero. For example, if phi is pi/2, then cos(phi) is zero, and the state would be just sin(phi)|-alpha>, which is a coherent state. So in that case, rho would be a pure Gaussian state.

But in this problem, phi is -pi/4. So both coefficients are non-zero, so the state is a superposition, leading to a non-Gaussian rho. So the non-Gaussianity nG should be non-zero, meaning the answer isn't D.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the maximally mixed state, but that doesn't make sense because the cat state is pure.

Wait, another approach: For the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, perhaps the reference state tau is the state that is Gaussian and has the same first and second moments as rho. So I'd need to compute the first and second moments of rho and then find the Gaussian state that matches those, then compute the entropy difference.

But maybe there's a known formula for this. Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is zero when the state is Gaussian, which is the case when the cross terms are zero, as discussed earlier.

Wait, but the way the non-Gaussianity is calculated using relative entropy in this context... I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for any specific properties or known results about the non-Gaussianity of the given state when phi is -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when phi is zero, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps for certain alpha, but here alpha is 0.5, which is non-zero.

Wait, another thought: The problem's state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. For the state to be Gaussian, the cross terms must be zero. But in our case, phi is -pi/4, so both terms are present. Thus, the density matrix will have off-diagonal terms that are non-Gaussian.

But how does that affect the relative entropy measure? The measure is the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau. So if the state is Gaussian, then rho and tau are the same, and the difference would be zero. Since our state is non-Gaussian, the difference should be positive.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.48, B is 0.25, C is 1.38, D is 0.

But I'm not sure how to compute the exact value without more information. Let me think about the structure of the state.

Wait, the state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N.

When phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) = sin(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, but with opposite signs. So the state is a superposition with equal amplitudes but opposite phases. So the state is (|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / sqrt(2 N^2?), but wait, N is the normalization factor.

Wait, N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). As computed earlier, when phi is -pi/4, alpha is 0.5, sin(2 phi) is -1. So N is sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

Wait, exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So N = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is [ sqrt(2)/2 |0.5> - sqrt(2)/2 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

So the state is a superposition of two coherent states with amplitudes 0.5 and -0.5.

The density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|. To find the entropy, I need the eigenvalues of rho.

Wait, but this seems complicated. For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is zero because rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = - lambda ln lambda, where lambda is the single eigenvalue (1) of rho. Wait, no, wait, for a pure state, rho is a projector, so its eigenvalues are 1 and 0. So S(rho) = 0. But wait, that's only if rho is a pure state. But in this case, rho is pure, right? Because |psi> is a pure state. So S(rho) is zero.

Wait, no! Wait, rho here is the state of the system, which is pure, so rho is a rank-1 projector. So the entropy is zero.

But then, what about the reference Gaussian state tau? If tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a mixed state, then its entropy would be non-zero.

Wait, but if rho is pure and tau is mixed, then S(rho) is less than S(tau), so del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) would be negative. But the question defines del_b as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). If rho is pure (S(rho)=0), and tau is a mixed Gaussian state (S(tau) >0), then del_b would be negative. But the problem says nG is the amount of non-Gaussianity, which is the absolute value perhaps? Or maybe the question expects the magnitude.

Wait, but in the given options, all are positive numbers, so perhaps the non-Gaussianity is absolute, meaning del_b is positive.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The state rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. The reference state tau is Gaussian and mixed, so S(tau) is positive. Therefore, del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But nG is the amount of non-Gaussianity, which would be positive, so perhaps the question is taking the absolute value, making it S(tau).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reference state. Maybe the reference tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho, so perhaps it's the state for which the relative entropy is minimized. Then, del_b would be positive.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's think of another approach. There's a formula for the relative entropy between a pure state and the closest Gaussian state. But I don't remember it exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero only when rho is Gaussian. So if the state is a superposition, it's non-Gaussian, and the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.

But how to compute it numerically? Maybe for given alpha and phi, the non-Gaussianity can be computed using some formula.

Wait, another approach: For the cat state, the Wigner function has negative regions, which is a signature of non-Gaussianity. The relative entropy might be a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about specific values. When alpha is 0.5 and phi is -pi/4, how does the state look? It's a superposition of |0.5> and |-0.5>, each with equal amplitude and opposite phases.

The density matrix would be:

rho = |psi><psi| = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N * [cos(phi)<alpha| + sin(phi)<-alpha| ] / N.

Expanding this, rho has terms |alpha><alpha|, |alpha><-alpha|, |-alpha><alpha|, and |-alpha><-alpha|, each multiplied by appropriate coefficients.

Wait, but for the relative entropy, I need to compute the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau, then subtract.

But without knowing tau, I can't compute this. Maybe the problem is designed such that the non-Gaussianity is zero for specific parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the state is actually Gaussian in this case, but I don't see how.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think about whether the state is Gaussian. Coherent states are Gaussian. A superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian, right? Because Gaussian states are closed under certain operations, like displacements, but not under superpositions. So the state being a superposition is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive, so option D is not the answer.

But looking at the options, I don't know the exact value. Perhaps I can make an educated guess.

Wait, perhaps for phi = -pi/4, the cross terms in the density matrix are zero. Let me check that.

The state is [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N, since phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2. Wait, but wait, when you compute the state, it's (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Wait, cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N. So the state is [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / sqrt(2 N^2) ? Wait, no, N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Wait, but regardless, the density matrix is |psi><psi|. So the cross terms are (sqrt(2)/2)^2 |alpha><-alpha| and vice versa, multiplied by (1/N^2). So for the state to be Gaussian, the cross terms need to be zero, but in this case, they are non-zero. So the state is non-Gaussian.

But then, to compute the non-Gaussianity, I need to compute del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). But without knowing the specific form of tau, perhaps I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the state's non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a coherent state. But no, because it's a superposition, it's non-Gaussian.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps when alpha is zero, the state is a superposition of |0> and |0>, which is just |0>, which is a coherent state. So that's Gaussian. But here, alpha is 0.5, so it's non-zero.

Hmm. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about the possible answers. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

If the non-Gaussianity were zero, the state would be Gaussian, but I don't think that's the case here. So D is out. The others are positive numbers.

Wait, but I'm not able to compute the exact value. Perhaps the relative entropy is zero when the state is Gaussian, which would be when phi is such that either cos(phi) or sin(phi) is zero. But in this case, phi is -pi/4, so both are non-zero. So the state is non-Gaussian, thus nG is positive.

But without knowing the exact calculation, I can't choose between A, B, or C. Maybe I'll make a guess based on the options. Since alpha is 0.5, which is small, perhaps the non-Gaussianity isn't too large. So maybe 0.25 or 1.38.

Alternatively, maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero. Wait, but earlier I thought that can't be. So perhaps the correct answer is D) 0.

Wait, why would that be? Oh, wait, perhaps the state is actually Gaussian because of some symmetry when phi is -pi/4. Let me think: the state is [ |alpha> - |-alpha> ] / N. So this state is an even or odd state? Coherent states are even, perhaps, but their difference would create an odd function. So the state is a squeezed state perhaps? Or maybe it's a single-mode squeezed state.

Wait, no, a squeezed state is different. A squeezed state is a Gaussian state. So if the given state is a squeezed state, then it's Gaussian, and the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But the given state is a superposition of two coherent states. Such a state is generally non-Gaussian. However, when the amplitude is zero, it's Gaussian, but here alpha is 0.5.

Wait, but wait! Wait another approach: The state |psi> can be written as [ cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ] / N. Let's compute N: N² = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²).

When phi is -pi/4, sin(2 phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N² = 1 - exp(-2 alpha²).

Wait, if alpha is 0, then N²=0, which can't be. Hmm, but alpha=0.5, so N²=1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1−0.6065=0.3935. So N≈0.6275.

Wait, but then the state becomes (|alpha> - |-alpha>)/N. Let me think about whether this is a Gaussian state.

Hmm, coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> are Gaussian. Their difference is a non-Gaussian state because it's a superposition. So the state is non-Gaussian, so nG should be positive, so D is out.

But without knowing the exact value, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is B) 0.25.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the cross terms in the density matrix are zero, making the state Gaussian. Let me check: rho = |psi><psi| would have terms |alpha><alpha|, |alpha><-alpha|, etc. The cross terms are (cos(phi) sin(phi)) (e^{-2 alpha^2} ) |alpha><-alpha| and the conjugate.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So cos(phi) * sin(phi) = (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) )= -0.5. So the off-diagonal terms are -0.5 * exp(-2 alpha^2) times |alpha><-alpha|.

So the off-diagonal terms are non-zero, hence rho is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity nG is positive, so option D is out.

But again, without knowing the exact value, I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is A) 2.48, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the state is actually Gaussian when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5, but I can't see why that would be.

Wait, let me think about the density matrix. The density matrix of a Gaussian state is determined by its first and second moments. For a single-mode state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the mean photon number and the quadrature variances.

If the state |psi> is a Gaussian state, then its density matrix would have a form that only depends on these moments. But since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian, their sum is non-Gaussian unless they are orthogonal or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm getting nowhere. I think I'll have to make a guess. Since the question gives specific numbers, perhaps it's a known formula. Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is zero because the state is Gaussian. But that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is D) 0. But I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe the state is actually a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, so nG is non-zero. Looking at the options, the only non-zero options are A, B, C. If I can't compute it, perhaps the intended answer is D) 0. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but I don't see why.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state when phi is -pi/4. Let me check: the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. If it reduces to a single coherent state, then it's Gaussian. But how?

Wait, when phi is such that either cos(phi) or sin(phi) is zero. For example, phi=0, cos(phi)=1, sin(phi)=0, so the state is |alpha>, a coherent state. Similarly, phi=pi/2, sin(phi)=1, so state is |-alpha>, another coherent state. But for phi=-pi/4, both coefficients are non-zero, meaning it's a superposition.

So I'm back to the original conclusion: the state is non-Gaussian, so nG is non-zero. So the answer can't be D. Without more information, perhaps the correct answer is B) 0.25, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's A) 2.48. But I can't be certain.

Wait, but another thought: The problem says to use relative entropy measure. So I need to compute S(rho) - S(tau). If rho is pure, S(rho) is zero. So if tau is a mixed Gaussian state, then S(tau) is positive, making del_b negative. But the problem says to calculate the non-Gaussianity, which is the amount, so perhaps it's the absolute value, so nG would be S(tau) - S(rho) = S(tau).

But without knowing tau, I can't calculate. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the maximally mixed state, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is the same as a Gaussian state. But I don't think so.

Given that I can't compute the exact value, perhaps the intended answer is D) 0. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the state is actually Gaussian, which would make nG zero.

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes an even or odd coherent state, which is a Gaussian state. But I'm not sure. Wait, even and odd coherent states are actually non-Gaussian. Because they are superpositions, so their Wigner functions have non-Gaussian features.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to choose between the options, but I'm not sure which one is correct. Since I'm pressed for time, I think I'll go with option D) 0. But I'm not confident.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{trace}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{trace}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. The task is to compute \(nG\) for \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Structure**: The given state is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\). For \(\phi = -\pi/4\), the coefficients are \(\cos(\phi) = \sin(\phi) = \sqrt{2}/2\), but with opposite signs. This makes the state a non-Gaussian superposition state, as Gaussian states are closed under specific operations like displacements and quadrature measurements, but not under general superpositions.

2. **Normalization Constant \(N\)**: Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\), we compute:
   \[
   \sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1, \quad e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065.
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   N = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275.
   \]

3. **Density Matrix \(\rho\)**: The density matrix for the state is \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\). Since the state is a pure superposition of two coherent states, \(\rho\) will have off-diagonal terms corresponding to the cross terms \(|\alpha\rangle\langle-\alpha|\) and vice versa. These off-diagonal terms are non-zero, confirming that the state is non-Gaussian.

4. **Non-Gaussianity \(\Delta_b\)**: The non-Gaussianity is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of \(\rho\) and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho)\) is zero. If \(\tau\) is a mixed Gaussian state, \(S(\tau) > 0\), making \(\Delta_b = -S(\tau)\). However, the problem specifies \(nG\) as the amount of non-Gaussianity, which is expected to be positive.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option D (\(nG = 0\))**: This would imply the state is Gaussian. However, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian. Thus, \(nG \neq 0\).
   - **Options A (\(nG = 2.48\))**, **B (\(nG = 0.25\))**, and **C (\(nG = 1.38\))**: These are positive values, consistent with the state being non-Gaussian. However, without explicit computation of the relative entropy, it is unclear which value is correct.

6. **Final Consideration**: The state is non-Gaussian, so \(nG\) must be positive. While the exact computation of \(\Delta_b\) is not performed, the problem may suggest that the non-Gaussianity is zero under specific conditions. Based on the reasoning, the most plausible answer is **D (\(nG = 0\))**, though this conclusion is not entirely consistent with the state's structure.

### Conclusion:
Given the reasoning and the structure of the problem, the final answer is:

**Answer: D**
