Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. And the question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, okay, so this is about a harmonic oscillator, but in the relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is achieved when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But with relativity, things get more complicated because at high speeds, relativistic effects come into play.

In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, that's the classical case. But this problem is relativistic, so that simple formula probably doesn't apply anymore.

Relativity introduces the concept of total energy being the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, and how energy and momentum relate. So I think I need to use relativistic equations.

In special relativity, the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, so E = gamma * mc². And gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy would then be E - mc², which is (gamma - 1) mc².

But wait, the oscillator is subject to a force F = -kx, so the potential energy is U = (1/2)k x². So in the maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, how does this energy relate to the kinetic energy?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of conservation of energy. At the maximum amplitude position (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium position (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in reality, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies oscillate. But the total mechanical energy should be conserved, considering relativity.
