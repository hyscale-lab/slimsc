Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so first I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime they experience is their proper lifetime, τ₀, but because of time dilation in special relativity, the lifetime observed in the lab frame (the lab's time) is longer. The formula for that is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. But then, the actual observed lifetime depends on the speed of the particle, right?

But the problem is about the minimum resolution of the detector. I think the detector's resolution determines how well it can measure the position where the decay occurred. The decay products will travel a certain distance before being detected, and if the detector can't resolve that distance, we can't see the decay.

So, the minimum distance that the decay products travel before detection is important. Wait, but how does that tie into the proper lifetime?

Wait, another thought. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. In the lab frame, the particle is moving, so it lives longer. The distance it travels before decaying is v * τ, where τ is the dilated lifetime. So, the maximum distance the particle can travel before decaying is v * γ τ₀. But wait, the decay can happen at any point in that path, so the minimum distance that the decay products (like Y⁺ and Z⁻) fly before we can detect them is something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to find the minimum distance that, if the detector can't resolve it, the decay would be missed. So for the detector to see the decay, the decay products must travel a distance that is less than the detector's resolution. Because if they fly too far, the tracks might not be close enough for the detector to distinguish.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. I think the idea is that the decay occurs, and the particles Y and Z will start moving from that point. The detector can only see the decay if the decay vertex is within a certain resolution. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's about the time it takes for the decay to be detected. Or perhaps it's about the length over which the decay products move before the chamber can register them.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum distance the decay products must travel so that the detector can observe them, considering the time it takes for the decay to happen and for the products to be detected.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the time it takes for the decay to be detected, and the minimum resolution refers to the spatial resolution needed to distinguish the decay point.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the minimum distance the particle can move before decaying, which would be the length that the decay products travel during their proper lifetime. But that's in the particle
