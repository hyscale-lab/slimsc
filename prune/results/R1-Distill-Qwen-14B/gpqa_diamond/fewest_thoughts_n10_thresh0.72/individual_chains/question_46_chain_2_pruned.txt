Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to find out how many possible products are formed when this compound is treated with Grubbs. And I should exclude ethene from the count.

Wait, Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions, right? Specifically, it's a transition metal catalyst that facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. So, the reaction is a ring-closing olefin metathesis, I think. But wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is an alkene, so when Grubbs is used, it can undergo ring-closing metathesis if possible.

Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. The pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, maybe I should write the structure properly.

Wait, the structure of pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would imply a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would add a methyl branch on the third carbon. So that's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, but that's four carbons after the double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, wait
