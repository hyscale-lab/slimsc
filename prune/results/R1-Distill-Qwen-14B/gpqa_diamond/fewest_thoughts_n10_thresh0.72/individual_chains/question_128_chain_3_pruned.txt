Okay, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I need to figure out which plasmid to use.

Hmm, I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid has to have the correct sequence for the gene of interest, including the right promoter and reading frame. Since P53 is a human protein, it's probably cloned into a plasmid with a suitable promoter for E. coli, like the T7 promoter, which BL21 strains use because they have the T7 RNA polymerase.

Looking at the options, each plasmid starts with 'ATG', which is the start codon methionine. So that's good because it likely means the gene is in frame. But I need to check the presence of a promoter before the start codon.

Wait, actually, the plasmid sequences provided are all the same except for some parts. Let me look more carefully. The beginning of each sequence is the same up to a point. Let's see, the first part is ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAG... So after the start codon (ATG), the next nucleotides are GAG, which codes for glutamic acid. That's correct because the amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSDPSVE... So the first amino acid is methionine (M), followed by glutamic acid (E), etc.

But I think what's important is the presence of a promoter before the ATG. E. coli uses promoters like lacZ or T7. Since BL21 strains are typically T7 polymerase-dependent, the plasmid should have a T7 promoter upstream of the gene.

Wait, looking at the given sequences, the beginning is ATG... So perhaps the promoter is already present before that in the plasmid. Alternatively, the sequences provided might only show the gene part, not the entire plasmid. That complicates things because I can't see the promoter here.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of a Kozak sequence or other E. coli-specific features is important, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is whether the sequence is complete. The given amino acid sequence is long, so the plasm
