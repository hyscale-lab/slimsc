Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when this compound is treated with Grubbs catalyst, excluding ethene. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Olefin metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. It can either be ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis. Since the starting material is an alkene, I think it's about ring-closing metathesis here.

The compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Let me count. Pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. No, wait. Wait, pent means five carbons. So position 3 in pentene would be the third carbon in the chain. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. Wait, that can't be right because that's four carbons. Oh wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Ok, the main chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH
