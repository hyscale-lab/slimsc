Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is. It's about a series of reactions starting with a specific compound, and I need to figure out the final product. Hmm, I remember that each step involves a different reaction, so I'll need to go through each step carefully.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexanone with a ketone at position 1. Then, position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a substituent where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 2. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2–C(CH2–)–, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH2– but with a substituent on the second carbon. Wait, no, the structure is CH2–C(=CH2)–, perhaps? Let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is actually (CH2)C=CH2. No, wait, perhaps it's the group that's CH2–CH(CH2–) with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I should draw this.

Wait, the structure of 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let's think:

Cyclohexanone with the ketone at position 1. Then, position 3 is a hydroxymethyl (–CH2OH), and position 5 is a propenyl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH2–CH2 group with the double bond between 1 and 2, but the substituent is on carbon 2. Wait, no. Prop-1-en-
