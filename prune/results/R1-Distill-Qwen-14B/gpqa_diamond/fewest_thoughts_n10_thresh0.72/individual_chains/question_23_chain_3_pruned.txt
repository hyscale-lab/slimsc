Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked the TLC and saw the reactant spot getting smaller with two new spots. So, I need to find out which products are formed from this reaction.

First, I should draw the structure of the starting material to visualize it better. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, it's a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether part is the but-3-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down. The but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2? Wait, no. Butene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but the numbering is from the end. But-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at carbon 3? Wait, but but has four carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between C3 and C4 in the but-3-enyl group. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, that can't be right because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2-CH2, but that's only four carbons. Wait, maybe I messed up.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2, but that doesn't make sense because for a four-carbon chain, the double bond can't be at position 3. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH=CH? No, that's but-1-ene. Wait, perhaps I should think again. The but-3-en-1-yl group has the double bond starting at carbon 3. So positions would be 1, 2, 3, 4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2... but wait, that's four carbons. So if it's but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-
