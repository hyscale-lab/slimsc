Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's break it down.

First, I need to visualize the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons, and the double bond starts at the first carbon. So it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂? Wait, no. Let me count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 1 is where the double bond starts. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the main chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. And there's a methyl group on C3. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH
