Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, so higher mass and smaller volume would mean higher density.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So its density is the same as Earth's, which is about 5.5 g/cm³. I think that's the baseline.

Option b) states it has 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if the density is the same, the mass being double would mean the volume is also double, right? Because density is mass/volume. So if mass doubles and volume doubles, density stays the same. So this planet's density is same as Earth's. But wait, the question is about which has the highest density. So this one is 5.5, same as Earth.

Option c) is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Wait, same composition implies same density as Earth, right? Because composition affects the average density. So if it's made of the same materials, its density should be same. So despite being more massive, density is same. So maybe 5.5 g/cm³.

Option d) is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same density as Earth. So same as a, 5.5.

Wait, but then all of the options a, b, c, d have
