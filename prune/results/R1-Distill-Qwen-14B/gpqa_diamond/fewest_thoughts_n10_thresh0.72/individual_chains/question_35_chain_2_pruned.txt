Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, which is a muon's. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix and is represented by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h over 4π, right? And S has a specific form: the first row is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The options are A to D, and I have to pick which statement is correct during the calculation.

First, let me write down what Ay looks like. Since c is h/(4π), and S is the matrix:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So multiplying by c, Ay becomes:

[ 0*(h/(4π)) , (-i)*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)) , 0*(h/(4π)) ]

Which is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Wait, remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are usually σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The given S matrix looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix (σ_y), except for the signs. Let me recall: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So S here is exactly σ_y.

So S is σ_y, and Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2 for their respective spin components. But wait, when you multiply a matrix by a scalar, the eigenvalues get multiplied by that scalar. So if S is σ_y, its eigenvalues are ±1 (since σ matrices have eigenvalues ±1?), no wait, no, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1? Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1? Or maybe ±i?

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. The eigenvalues of σ_y should be ±1. Let me check that. The matrix σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Let's compute its eigenvalues. The trace is 0, the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = -(i*(-i)) = -(i^2)= -(-1)=1. So the determinant is 1. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - (trace)λ + det = 0. So λ^2 + 1 = 0. So λ = ±i. Wait, that can't be right because σ matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues must be real. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the matrix. Oh wait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]], and if I compute its trace for eigenvalues, the trace is zero. The determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = (i^2)*(-1) because (-i)(i)
