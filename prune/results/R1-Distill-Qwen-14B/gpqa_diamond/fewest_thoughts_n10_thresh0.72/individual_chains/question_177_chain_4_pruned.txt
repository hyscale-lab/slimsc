Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. So, astronomers are comparing them. The given info is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are 1.5 times bigger for Star_1.

But wait, the question is about luminosity. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where L is luminosity, R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the effective temperature. So, to find the ratio of luminosities, I probably need the ratio of their temperatures as well as their radii.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember Wien's law, which states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, so T1 equals T2? Because λ_max is same for both.

Wait, but earlier I thought mass and radius are different. But if T is same, then the luminosity ratio would depend on the radius squared, since L is proportional to R² T⁴. So if T is same, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2. Since R1 is 1.5 R2, then (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would make the factor ~2.25, which is option A.

But wait, wait a second. The question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has
