Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Where β is 1/(kT). So each term in Z is the Boltzmann factor for a specific state.

First, I should figure out all the possible states of the system. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, there are 2^3 =8 possible states. Let me list them all.

But wait, maybe I can find a smarter way without listing all 8. Because each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Let me think about what the energy E depends on.

E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each of the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be +1 or -1. Let me denote each product as something else. Let me call a = S1S2, b = S1S3, c = S2S3. Then E = -J (a + b + c). 

But since a = S1 S2, and so on, each of a, b, c can be ±1. So the sum a + b + c could be -3, -1, 1, or 3. Wait, how?

Wait, for three terms each of which is ±1, the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Let me think: the maximum sum is when all three are +1: 3. The minimum is when all three are -1: -3. Then other possibilities are when two are +1 and one -1, which gives 1, or two -1 and one +1, which gives -1.

Wait, but wait. Let me check. If two are +1 and one is -1, sum is (+1 + +1 -1)
