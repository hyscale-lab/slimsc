Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Then it undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find out the structure of the final product, product 4. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, let me break down each reaction step.

First step: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent, especially in situations where you need a good leaving group. Benzyl bromide is a benzylating agent. So maybe this is an alkylation reaction.

Looking at the starting molecule: it's a cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and the 5 position has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is an isopropenyl group (–CH2–C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH2–CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH2–CH2 with the double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is CH2–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Wait no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH(CH2–). Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2–C(CH2)=CH2? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe it's CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, I think I'm getting
