Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that structure. So, cyclohexanone ring, with a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 5. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group with the double bond between C1 and C2, so it's CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring, right? Or wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Oh wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- attached through the middle carbon. Wait, no, the structure is CH2–C=CH2? No, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond starting at C1, so maybe it's CH2=CH–CH2–, but attached at the second carbon. Hmm, maybe it's (CH2)2C-CH2, but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's an isopropenyl group, which is CH2=C(CH2-), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to just proceed with the reactions and see.

The first step is treating this compound with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate compounds. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, so it's probably an SN2 reaction, where the base deprotonates a site, and then the benzyl group is added.

Looking at the starting compound, which positions have acidic hydrogens? The cyclohexanone has a carbonyl, so alpha hydrogens are acidic. The hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) is
