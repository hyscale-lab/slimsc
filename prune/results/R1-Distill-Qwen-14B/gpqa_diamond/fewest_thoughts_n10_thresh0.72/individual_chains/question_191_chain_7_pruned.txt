Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Then it undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find out the structure of the final product, product 4. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, let me break down each reaction step.

First step: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent, especially in situations where you need a good leaving group. Benzyl bromide is a benzylating agent. So maybe this is an alkylation reaction.

Looking at the starting molecule: it's a cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. The 3 position has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and the 5 position has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is an isopropenyl group (–CH2–C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH2–CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH2–CH2 with the double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is CH2–CH2–CH3 with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Wait no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH(CH2–). Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as CH2–C(CH2)=CH2? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe it's CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, I think I'm getting

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that structure. So, cyclohexanone ring, with a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and a prop-1-en-2-yl group at position 5. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group with the double bond between C1 and C2, so it's CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring, right? Or wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Oh wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- attached through the middle carbon. Wait, no, the structure is CH2–C=CH2? No, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond starting at C1, so maybe it's CH2=CH–CH2–, but attached at the second carbon. Hmm, maybe it's (CH2)2C-CH2, but I might be getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's an isopropenyl group, which is CH2=C(CH2-), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to just proceed with the reactions and see.

The first step is treating this compound with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate compounds. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent, so it's probably an SN2 reaction, where the base deprotonates a site, and then the benzyl group is added.

Looking at the starting compound, which positions have acidic hydrogens? The cyclohexanone has a carbonyl, so alpha hydrogens are acidic. The hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) is
