Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product. Let me take it step by step.

First, let's try to parse the question. The reaction sequence starts with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a mouthful. I'm picturing a norbornene structure, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the starting material is a norbornene with an oxygen substituent.

The first reaction is combining this with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, sodium iodide and elevated temperature make me think of elimination reactions or maybe coupling. But wait, the presence of dibromomethyl groups suggests possible substitution.

Wait, the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the cyclohexadiene has two substituents at positions 5 and 6. Each substituent is a dibromomethyl group. That means each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group attached? Wait, no, wait. Wait, dibromomethyl would be Br2CH- , so each substituent is a CH2Br2 group. So each of those positions has two bromine atoms attached to a methyl group.

Now, combining with sodium iodide, which is a good nucleophile source. So maybe SN2 reactions? But that's a bit tricky with such a hindered structure. Alternatively, perhaps elimination? Or maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing some kind of substitution. Wait, but if we have two equivalents of that diene and two substituents on the starting molecule, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? No, because the starting molecule is a diene itself, norbornene.

Wait, perhaps it's a [4+2] cycloaddition? But norbornene is a conjugated diene, and the other compound is a dienophile? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, but wait, the other compound
