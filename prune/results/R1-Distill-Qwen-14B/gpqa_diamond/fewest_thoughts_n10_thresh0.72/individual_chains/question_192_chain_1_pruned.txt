Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. So the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. I need to find the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So the conductor is initially uncharged. When the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in a conductor, charges rearrange themselves. But wait, the conductor was neutral before, so how does that affect things?

In the case of a conductor with a cavity, the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the charge is positive, the inner surface will have an induced negative charge. But because the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must then have a positive charge equal in magnitude to the induced negative charge. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

So the conductor was initially neutral. When +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is the sum of inner and outer charges, which would be (-q) + (+q) = 0. Oh wait, no, the conductor was initially neutral, so the total charge must still be zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it. Wait, that would make the conductor have a charge of zero. Because the conductor's own charge would be the sum of all induced charges. But the initial conductor is uncharged, so any induced charges must balance out. Wait no, the conductor's charge is the sum of inner and outer induced charges. When a charge is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface becomes -q, so the outer surface must be +q to keep the conductor's net charge zero. No, wait, the conductor is initially neutral, so it doesn't have any charge. So the inner surface has -q, then the outer surface must have +q, making the total conductor's charge (-q) + (+q) = 0. So that makes sense.

But wait, the conductor as a whole is neutral, so the outer surface has +q? Or is it that the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q, but the conductor's net charge is zero. Hmm, I think that's correct.

But when considering the electric field outside the conductor, what matters is the charge on the outer surface. Because the electric field outside a conductor is due to all the charges enclosed within the conductor. But in this case, the conductor's total charge is zero? Wait, no, because the conductor's own
