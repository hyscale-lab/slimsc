Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. So, first, I need to figure out what Compound A is. C3H6 could be either propene (which is an alkene) or propyne (an alkyne). Wait, wait, the formula for propene is C3H6? Let me check: yes, because the general formula for alkenes is CnH2n, so propene (n=3) would be C3H6. Propyne is C3H4, so no, that's not it. So Compound A is propene.

Next, Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes usually refers to adding bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacting with Br2 in CCl4 would undergo an addition reaction. Since propene is a simple alkene, the bromine would add across the double bond. Now, the addition can be either anti (like in dibromination) or maybe it's a radical addition? Wait, no, wait, in CCl4, it's a non-polar solvent, but for bromination of alkenes, it's typically an addition reaction. So propene would add Br2 across the double bond to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, or maybe it's a different structure. Propene is CH2CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it typically causes an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, the dibromide (1,2-dibromopropane) would lose HBr when treated with KOH. The reaction would produce propene
