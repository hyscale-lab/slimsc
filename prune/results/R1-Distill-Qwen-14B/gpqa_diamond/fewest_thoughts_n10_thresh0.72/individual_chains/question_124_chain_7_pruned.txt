Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles produce new types that travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reaches the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that in particle physics, the Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I'm not sure how that ties into the distance they travel. Oh wait, right, the particles decay quickly, so their lifetime is very short, and their speed determines how far they go before decaying.

Wait, but the particles are traveling from the center, so the maximum distance they can go is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. But not all particles reach the wall because they decay before that. The fraction that reach the wall depends on their lifetime and speed.

I think the key here is the relation between the particle's lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) and the distance they travel. The mean lifetime gamma times the proper lifetime (tau) determines how long they live in the lab frame, so the distance they go is velocity v multiplied by that lifetime.

Wait, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. The distance they travel before decaying is L = v * gamma * tau. Because v is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles, right? Because when gamma is high, v is very close to c. So, for calculation purposes, maybe we can approximate v as c.

So the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is L = c * gamma * tau. But if the detector's radius is 30 m, then the particles that reach the wall must have L >= 30 meters. The fraction of particles that reach the wall is the fraction that live long enough for L >= 30 m.

Wait, but the problem says that at gamma ~20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So when gamma is 20, the fraction is about 1/3. Now, we want to find the gamma where the fraction is two-thirds, so double that.

Wait, why would the fraction change with gamma? Because a higher gamma would mean a longer lifetime in the lab frame, so more particles would reach the wall. Because at higher gamma, the particles live longer, so more of them make it to the edge.

So the fraction of particles reaching the wall depends on gamma. Let me think about how this fraction is calculated.

The number of particles that reach the wall is the number that don't decay before traveling 30 meters. The decay follows an exponential probability distribution. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-t/(gamma tau)). But since they're moving at velocity v
