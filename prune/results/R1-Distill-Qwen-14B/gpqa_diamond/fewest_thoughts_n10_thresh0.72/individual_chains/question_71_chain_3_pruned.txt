Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll think it through.

So, the question says there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation, but maybe that's not too important here. The main thing is their orbital periods.

They're asking about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so I don't need to worry about that factor. Equilibrium temperature... right, the formula for that is something like T = T0 * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T0 is the star's temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. I think the equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula is T = T_star * (L_star / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), or perhaps more simply, T scales with (R_star / a)^(1/2), assuming the star's luminosity is the same for all, which I think it is in this problem because we're comparing planets around the same star.

Wait, the formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. Because the further out a planet is, the less energy it receives, so the colder it is. So the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the ratio of their distances.

But wait, the key point is that the planets are in orbital resonance, and their periods are in a ratio. So if the periods are in a ratio, the semi-major axes are proportional to the cube of the period ratio because of Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³ → a ∝ P^(2/3).

So for each planet, a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is some constant based on the star's mass and other factors, which will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). Because T
