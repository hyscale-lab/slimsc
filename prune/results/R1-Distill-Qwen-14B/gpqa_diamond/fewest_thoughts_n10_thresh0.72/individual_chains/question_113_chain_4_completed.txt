Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully and break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms. The task is to determine which formula fits the given spectral data.

First, let's look at the FTIR information. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretches. So a broad peak here suggests the presence of either an alcohol (-OH) or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids also have a broad peak, but they often show up around 2500-3300, but sometimes the peak is even broader and possibly split into two, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak is broad due to hydrogen bonding or if it's a free -OH group.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that's likely a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester, or even an acid. The 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower than the typical 1700, so maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation or maybe an amide, but amides tend to be lower, around 1650. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a C=C stretch? Wait, wait, the C=C stretch is usually around 1600-1680, so 1650 would fit that. But the 1700 is higher, so that's more likely a carbonyl.

Wait, but if there are two peaks in that region, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl would have the C=O around 1680-1700 and the C=C around 1620-1650. So maybe the compound has both a C=O and a C=C. Or perhaps one of the peaks is something else, like an aromatic ring.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are several peaks, including ones corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. So maybe an alkene is present. So the structure likely includes a double bond.

Then there's the mass spectrometry data. The fragment peak is at m/z=45. Hmm. So what fragments have a mass of 45? Let's think. 45 could be CH3CO (which is 45: 12 + 16*2 + 1*3 = 45? Wait, CH3CO is 12 + 3(1) + 12 + 16 = 12+3=15, 12+16=28; 15+28=43? Wait, no. Let me calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. CH3CO is (CH3)2CO would be more, but wait, maybe it's another fragment. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular ion of a fragment. So, I'm trying to think of what's m/z=45. Could it be (CH3)2O? Wait, that's 45? Let me compute: 2 carbons (24) + 6 H (6) + 16 O = 46. No, that's 46. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a ketone group? Like (CH2)CO. Wait, what's the m/z for a fragment with a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is something like CH3CH2O, which would be 45. Let me see: CH3CH2O has a molecular weight of (12*2)+(1*6)+(16) = 24+6+16=46. No, that's 46 again. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is one of four options. Let's list them:

A) C6H12O2 → Molecular weight is (6×12)+(12×1)+(2×16)=72 +12 +32= 116.

B) C6H10O → (72)+(10)+(16)=98.

C) C6H10O2 → 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O →72 +12 +16=100.

So, the molecular ions would be at m/z 116 (A), 98 (B), 114 (C), 100 (D).

But the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z=45. So the question is, which of these compounds, when fragmented, would produce a fragment with m/z=45.

Alternatively, maybe the base peak is the molecular ion, but the question says a fragment peak. So which of the options, when fragmented, would lose a part of the molecule to leave a 45 m/z?

Wait, 45 is a smaller fragment. Let's think about possible functional groups. For example, if the compound is ester, maybe the ester group could break. Or perhaps a methyl ester or something.

Wait, another approach: the fragment with m/z 45 could be from a ketone group. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, if we have a compound like CH3CO... something. The CH3CO group is 43 (12+16 + 12 +1 = 43?), wait no: CH3CO has 2 carbons, 3 H from CH3, 2 O. Wait, no. Let me compute: CH3CO is (12×2) + (7×1) + (16×1) = 24 +7 +16=47. Wait, that's 47. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, methyl group is 15 m/z, but 45 is three times that. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group? Or perhaps a ketone or an aldehyde.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible functional groups. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is probably O-H. So the compound has an -OH group. Then, the two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. If one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond, perhaps it's an ester. Because esters have two carbonyl groups: one from the ester (around 1740-1700) and another from the R group, maybe. Or maybe it's a ketone and an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but an ester would have a carbonyl around 1740. Here, the peak is at 1700, which is a bit lower, so maybe it's a conjugated ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl.

But let's look back. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So maybe an ester with a double bond elsewhere.

So the presence of O-H (from the IR), a carbonyl (1700), a conjugated double bond (1650), and vinyl hydrogens in the NMR. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid (since the O-H is broad), but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR might show a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but the given peak is at 3000. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the broad peak around 3300, so 3000 might be a stretch.

Wait, another thought: The 1700 peak might be from a ketone or ester. If it's a ketone, then that's another group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the IR. Let me think about the options. The options are four possible formulas. Let me see what each formula could represent.

Option A: C6H12O2. What functional groups could that be? It could be something like an ester (RCOOR'), which would have two oxygen atoms. Alternatively, a diol, but then we'd have more O-H groups, which might show different NMR peaks. But considering the IR data, we have a carbonyl, so maybe ester. Because esters have a carbonyl.

Option B: C6H10O. That would be something like an alcohol with one O, but then the carbonyl (1700) wouldn't fit unless it's a ketone. But then the O would be in a ketone and perhaps an alcohol. Wait, but C6H10O could be a cyclic ether, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Option C: C6H10O2. That's two oxygen atoms. Could be an ester (RCOOR'), a ketone and an alcohol (but that would require more hydrogens?), or a carboxylic acid with an alcohol. Hmm.

Option D: C6H12O. That's one oxygen. Maybe a ketone (RCOR'), but then where's the O in the IR.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak, which is more consistent with an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the compound is a diol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, an ester, which doesn't have an O-H group, but wait the IR says a broad peak at 3000, which would imply an O-H. So if it's an ester, then where's the O-H? Oh, wait, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H around 2500-3300, but the given peak is at 3000. Hmm, perhaps that's possible. Then, the 1700 cm^-1 would be the C=O of the acid. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring, but wait, the compound has a vinyl group as per the NMR. So maybe the acid has a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid with a double bond would have a carbonyl at around 1700 and another peak for the double bond, maybe. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have a carbonyl (around 1700-1750), but if it's conjugated, maybe it's lower. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have the carbonyl at around 1700 and the C=C at around 1650. So that fits the IR data.

If the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond, that would explain the IR peaks. Then the NMR would show vinyl hydrogens, which aligns with that.

Now, the FTIR also shows a broad peak at 3000, which would suggest an O-H group. Wait, but esters don't have O-H groups. So this is a problem. Unless the O-H is from another part of the molecule, like a diol. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the compound is a diester, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid with an ester group, but that would require more oxygen atoms.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is likely O-H. So that suggests the presence of either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

If it's an alcohol, the formula would have at least one O. Let's look at the options:

A) C6H12O2 → two O's. Could be an alcohol and a ketone, but the IR would have a C=O at ~1700, which could be the ketone.

B) C6H10O → one O, perhaps an alcohol and a conjugated double bond.

C) C6H10O2 → two O's. Could be an ester (which doesn't have O-H) unless it's a hemiacetal or something else. Or a carboxylic acid (which would have O-H) and another O elsewhere.

D) C6H12O → one O, but if it's an alcohol, then where's the 1700 cm^-1 peak? That would suggest another group like a ketone, but with only one O, that's possible.

Wait, but the IR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So if the compound has a ketone (1700) and a conjugated double bond (1650), then the O-H would have to come from an alcohol. So the formula would have at least one O for the alcohol and another for the ketone.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2 → two O's. That could be a ketone (1 O) and an alcohol (another O). So the formula fits.

Option C: C6H10O2 → also two O's. Could be an ester (no O-H), but then why the broad peak unless it's a carboxylic acid. But an ester doesn't have O-H, so the O-H must come from something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but then the NMR would show more O-H signals, perhaps. But the question states that the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens but doesn't mention O-H signals. Hmm, maybe if it's a diol, it would have broad O-H peaks, but the FTIR might show a broader, more complex peak. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, which is more typical of an alcohol O-H. So perhaps the compound is a ketone and an alcohol. So the formula would need two O's, which is options A or C.

But let's look at the mass spec. The fragment peak is at m/z=45.

So let's think about each option and how they could fragment.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structure could be an ester, like methyl cyclopentanoate or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be a diol with a ketone. But if it's an ester, the molecular formula would be RCOOR', so for example, ethyl something. Wait, the molecular formula is C6H12O2. That could be, for example, methyl cyclopentane carboxylate, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But again, I'm not sure.

If the compound is an ester, then during mass spec, it might break into the RCOO group and the R' part. Let's say the ester is RCOOR', so the RCOO would have a molecular weight of (n carbons ×12) + (m hydrogens ×1) + (o oxygens ×16). The R' part would be the rest.

But I'm not sure how that would lead to a fragment of 45. Let me think: what's the molecular formula of the fragment that could be 45? Let's see: 45 is about the mass of a methyl group with something. Wait, 45 could be CH2O2? No, that's 44. Alternatively, maybe (CH3)COO^−, but no, that's 59. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C6H12O2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: (6×12) + 12×1 + (2×16) = 72 +12 +32=116.

So the molecular ion would be at 116. But the question says a fragment is at 45, so 45 is much smaller than the molecular ion. So perhaps the molecule loses a larger fragment, leaving a smaller one.

Wait, 45 is a common fragment for a ketene group (CH2CO), which is (12×2)+(1×4) +16=24+4+16=44. Wait, close but not 45.

Another thought: maybe the fragment is a propyl group attached to something. For example, CH2CH2CO (but that's 43), but again, not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methoxy group attached to something else. Wait, methoxy is 31 (15+16=31). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is an acetyl group, which is (CH3CO) with a molecular weight of 43. Hmm, but 43 isn't 45.

Wait, what about a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH3? That's 31. Not 45.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketone group. For example, if the molecule breaks to form a ketone group, the fragment would have a carbonyl. Let's see, the ketone group would have (CO) with some carbons. Maybe the fragment is (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No, that's too big.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a smaller molecule, like ethylene oxide (which is 44). Hmm, but that's 44, not 45.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6×12 +10×1 + 2×16 = 72 +10 +32=114. So the molecular ion is at 114.

If the compound breaks into a fragment of 45, what would that mean? 45 is 45/114 ≈ 0.39 fraction of the molecular ion. So the fragment is about 40% of the molecular weight. That's a possible scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a smaller molecule that breaks off. For instance, if the compound is an ester, maybe the ester group breaks off as a smaller fragment. For example, an ester RCOOR' could lose R'COO⁻ as a fragment, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 45 m/z could correspond to (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3)+16 (O) + another CH3? Wait, no, (CH3)2O is 45. Because:

(CH3)2O is:

Carbon: 2×12=24,

Hydrogen: 6×1=6,

Oxygen: 16.

So 24 +6 +16=46. Oh wait, that's 46, not 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the possible functional groups in each formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be a diol with a ketone, which would have two O's. But would that produce a fragment of 45? Alternatively, it could be an ester, which would have two O's. If the ester breaks, perhaps the RCOO part is the fragment. For example, if the ester is a methyl ester, RCOOCH3. If the molecule breaks between R and COOCH3, the R part would be the remaining.

But I'm not getting any closer. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000, so O-H present. It also shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Let's say it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, like a beta-keto ester or something else.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, meaning a double bond is present, so the compound has a double bond.

Looking at the options, which have structures that could fit this?

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C6H12O2. The general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2O. For n=6, it's C6H14O2. So this formula is two hydrogens less, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. So a double bond or a ring.

But the NMR shows vinyl H, so a double bond is present. So the degrees of unsaturation is one (from the double bond) and possibly another from the carbonyl. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of Unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N, it's (2C +2 - H - O)/2. But wait, the formula is a bit different. Let me recall: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For our case, X and N are zero.

So for option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1.

Wait, that can't be right because a carbonyl group is a DoU of 1, and a double bond is another. So total DoU would be 2. But according to the formula, it's only 1. Hmm, that's a problem. So option A has only one DoU, but we have a carbonyl (1) and a double bond (1), which would require two DoU. So this can't be right. So option A is out.

Wait, let me recalculate. For option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 )/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So only one DoU. But the compound has a carbonyl (C=O) and a double bond (C=C), which would require two DoU. So that can't be. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Similarly, let's compute for option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0 )/2= (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two DoU. That could fit a carbonyl and a double bond. So possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Again, could fit a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So DoU 1. So that would fit a carbonyl and no double bond. But the NMR has vinyl H, so no. So option D is out.

So, from this analysis, options B, C, and A are possible, but A is out. So remaining are B, C.

Wait, no. I think I messed up. Option A was DoU 1, but requires two DoU (C=O and C=C), so it's not possible. So options B and C have DoU 2, which fit.

Option B: C6H10O. So one O. The IR has a broad peak (O-H), and a carbonyl. So this would suggest a compound with both an O-H and a carbonyl group. So possible structures: ketone and alcohol in the same molecule, which is possible. For example, cyclohexanone with a hydroxyl group.

The NMR would show vinyl H, so a double bond. But option B has DoU of 2, which could be a carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, but the compound would have O-H (alcohol), a carbonyl (ketone), and a double bond. That's possible.

But then the mass spec fragment at 45 would have to fit.

Alternatively, option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. O-H (alcohol) and a carbonyl (ketone or ester), plus a double bond. Or perhaps an ester and a double bond. But if it's an ester, it won't have an O-H, so that's conflicting with the IR's broad peak.

Wait, maybe the compound is a beta-keto acid. But that would have two carbonyl groups, but then the O-H would be from the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid with a double bond. Let's say it's a dienoic acid. But the O-H would be from the acid, and the carbonyl from it.

But let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at 45 could be a methyl ester group or something else. Or perhaps it's the loss of a larger fragment, leaving a smaller one.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula with O's that could lead to a fragment of 45.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is 98. If during fragmentation, the molecule breaks into a smaller part with 45, perhaps the remaining part is 53. Hmm, but not sure.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114. If it breaks into 45 and 69, that's possible.

Wait, 45 = 45. So what is 45 in terms of a possible fragment? Maybe a ketone group, like (CH3)CO, which is 43, but that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe CH2COOH (but that's 60?), no. Alternatively, perhaps a propyl group with something.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an ester. Let me think: if it's an ester, the formula would be RCOOR'. Suppose R is C5H9COO− and R' is methyl. Then the ester would be C6H12O2, but that would be option A. But earlier analysis said option A is not possible because of DoU.

Alternatively, thinking about option C: C6H10O2. Suppose it's a cyclic ester (lactone), like gamma-valerolactone, but that would have a different formula. Or perhaps a diester, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the ester group itself. For example, the ester fragment would be RCOO− with a molecular weight of 45.

Wait, RCOO− would be the formula (COOR). Let's see: RCOO− would have a molecular weight of 12*(n+1) + 16*2 + (2n+1), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene group, which has the formula O=C=O. Wait, no, that's O=C=O, which would be a carbonyl group with double bonds. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a formaldehyde group (HCHO, which is 30), but that's not 45.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me think again.

The possible structures that fit the IR and NMR data:

- O-H (broad peak at 3000)
- C=O at 1700
- C=C at 1650 (or conjugated carbonyl)
- Vinyl H in NMR.

So the compound could be a beta-keto acid. For example, something like CH2(CO2H)CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, that's probably not right. Alternatively, it's a dienolic acid with a conjugated carbonyl.

But another possibility: the compound is a substituted acrylic acid. For example, CH2=CHCOOH. That would have O-H (from the acid), a C=O (carboxylic acid), and a C=C (vinyl H). But the molecular formula would be C3H4O2. But the options are all C6, so maybe it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a di-substituted acrylic ester, but that's getting too vague.

Let me try to connect the mass spec. If the fragment is at 45, perhaps it's the loss of a larger group from the molecule, leaving a smaller fragment. For example, if the molecule loses a (molecular weight -45) fragment, then the remaining is 45.

Wait, for option C: molecular weight is 114. So 114-45=69. So the fragment with 45 is what remains after losing 69. But I can't think of what 69 would be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is a neutral loss. For example, losing CO (28) and something else. Hmm, but 45 is a specific fragment.

Another thought: The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Maybe it's an ester like methyl cyclopentane carboxylate. If the molecule breaks, perhaps the cyclopentane part stays, but that's not giving a 45 fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the ester breaks into two parts: RCOO- (which could be 45) and R' (the rest). Let's see: RCOO- would need to be 45. Let's compute what R would be.

RCOO- has a molecular weight of (n+1)*12 + (2n+1)*1 + 16*2. But no, wait, RCOO- is R-C-O-O-. So the formula is (n+1) carbons, 2n+1 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens. Wait, but the mass would be (n+1)*12 + (2n+1)*1 + 32. So (12n +12) + (2n +1) +32=14n +45.

Wait, that's not right. Alternatively, RCOO− has a molecular weight of (molecular weight of R) + 45. Wait, no. Let me think for a specific example.

If R is CH2CH2, then RCOO- would be CH2CH2COO-, which is C3H5O2^−. Its molecular weight is (3×12)+(5×1)+(2×16)=36+5+32=73. Hmm, that's higher than 45.

Alternatively, if R is CH3, then RCOO- is C2H5O2^−. Molecular weight: (2×12)+(5×1)+(32)=24+5+32=61. Still higher than 45.

Wait, perhaps the R is just a methyl group. Then RCOO- would be CH3COO^−, molecular weight 59. Hmm, but that's still not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is not RCOO^− but something else, like a ketone. So, for example, a fragment like (CH3)2CO has a molecular weight of 58. Not 45.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Let me think differently. The mass fragment of 45 could be the result of the loss of a larger part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule is an ester with a side chain, maybe it loses the side chain, leaving the ester group.

Wait, let's say the compound is an ester, RCOOR'. The molecular formula would be (C_nH_2nO2) for RCOOR' where R is CnH2n-1 and R' is CmH2m-1. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a propyl group attached to an oxygen. Like OCH2CH2CH2, but that's 44, not 45.

Wait, another approach: think of the possible structures in the options that could have O-H, a carbonyl, and a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. So one O. Could be a dienol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, a cyclohexenol with a ketone group. But if it's a cyclohexenol (cyclohexene with an alcohol), then the DoU would be two: one from the ring and one from the double bond. But the formula C6H10O has DoU 2. So that's possible.

Wait, but where is the ketone in that case? Because the IR shows a C=O peak. So the compound would have both an alcohol and a ketone. So the structure could be something like cyclohexenol with a ketone substituent. For example, cyclohex-2-en-1-one-ol. But that would require C6H10O2, not C6H10O.

Wait, no, because the formula would have two O's: one for the ketone (O) and one for the alcohol (O). So that's C6H10O2. Which is option C.

So, going back, option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So possible structures: a ketone (C=O) and a double bond (C=C). Plus an O-H group. So that fits the IR data.

In that case, the compound would have an O-H, a ketone, and a double bond. The NMR would show vinyl H, which fits.

Now, the mass spec fragment peak at 45. Let's think about the structure: if it's a ketone with a conjugated double bond and an alcohol group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like cyclohexenone with an adjacent hydroxyl group. But I'm not sure how that would fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a dienol, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted acrylic acid. For example, CH2=CHCOOH. But that's C3H4O2. The options are C6, but perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a di-substituted ester with an alcohol group. But that's getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group, but that would not explain the C=C.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula of option C is C6H10O2. If the structure is a beta-keto acid, such as CH2(CO2H)CH2CH2CH2CO2H, but that's longer than six carbons. Alternatively, maybe a smaller beta-keto acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclopentenone with an alcohol group. But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated beta-keto acid. For example, something like CH2=CH-CO-COOH. But again, the formula would need to be C6H10O2.

Wait, another thought: If the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an alcohol group, but that would require more oxygens.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the mass spec fragment again. The m/z=45 could correspond to a fragment like CH3COO− (methyl acetate fragment?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene fragment. A ketene has the structure R-C=C-O. The molecular weight for (CH3)C=C-O would be 58, which is too high. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a propyl group with an oxygen. For example, CH2CH2COO− would be 73. Not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a COOCH3 group. COOCH3 has a molecular weight of 15 +32 + (CH3:15 → COOCH3 is 45? Let me calculate: COOCH3 is (12×2 + 16×2) + (12 + 3×1) = 24 +32 +15=71. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a CH2COOH group. That would be 45? Let's compute: CH2COOH is (12×2) + (5×1) +16 +16=24 +5 +32=61. No, that's 61. Hmm.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a COO− group with a methyl, which would be (12 +16×2) = 44, which is close but not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CO group, which is 43. But the question says 45, so that's close but not exact.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the fragment is a propyl group with a double bond. Like CH2CH2CH2, but that's 42. Not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen with something else. For example, OCH2CH2CH3 (ethoxypropane?), but that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a cyclopropane ring with an oxygen. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a propyl group with an oxygen, like OCH2CH2CH3, which has a molecular weight of  (15 (CH2) ×3) +16 = 3×15=45? Wait, OCH2CH2CH3 is 16 + (3×15)=16+45=61. No, that's not right.

Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl group. For instance, a ketone fragment. If the molecule loses a larger group, the remaining would be the carbonyl.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Looking back, the key points:

- O-H (broad peak at ~3000 cm^-1)
- C=O at 1700
- C=C at 1650 (possibly conjugated)
- Vinyl H in NMR
- Mass spec fragment at 45.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → DoU 1 → can't have both a ketone and a double bond → invalid.

B) C6H10O → DoU 2 → could have a ketone and a double bond, but only one O → would the O-H be from an alcohol? So the compound would have a ketone and a double bond, plus an O-H. So structure: a dienol with a ketone? Not sure.

C) C6H10O2 → DoU 2 → has two O's, so could have an O-H and a ketone, plus a double bond. Structure: a compound with a conjugated carbonyl, a double bond, and an O-H group.

D) C6H12O → DoU 1 → can't have a double bond and a carbonyl → invalid.

So now the options are B and C.

But the IR also has a peak at 1650 cm^-1, which is lower than a typical carbonyl, suggesting conjugation or a C=C.

So, the structure must have a conjugated carbonyl group, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, which would have a lower wavenumber.

So, the structure could be an enone, such as a dienone.

So, the compound is an enol with a ketone group and an O-H.

But let's think of possible structures.

If the compound is a substituted cyclopentenone with an alcohol substituent, that would fit.

For example, something like 3-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone.

In that case, the IR would show:

- Broad O-H peak at ~3300 (but the question says 3000, which is a bit lower, but possible if it's an enol or something else).

- C=O around 1700, but in conjugation, perhaps lower. But the given peaks are 1700 and 1650. So the C=O is at 1700, and the C=C is at 1650, which fits the conjugated enone.

The NMR would show vinyl protons (the double bond), which aligns.

So, the formula would be C6H10O2. Let me compute: cyclopentenone has 5 carbons, plus another carbon from the hydroxyl group, making 6 carbons. The formula for 3-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone would be C6H8O2. Wait, but our options are C6H10O2 (option C) and C6H10O (option B).

Hmm, something isn't adding up. Let me think about the hydrogen count.

Wait, cyclopentenone has 5 carbons, with a double bond and a ketone. The structure would be:

O
||
C=C-OH

Wait, no, let me draw it properly.

If the structure is 3-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone, the formula would be C5H6O2. But we have six carbons, so perhaps it's a substituted version. Alternatively, maybe it's a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a hexenone with a hydroxyl group. For example, 4-hydroxy-3-hexen-2-one.

The formula would be C6H10O2. Because:

Each carbon in the chain: 6 carbons.

Hydrogen count: Let's see, 3-hexen-2-one would have the structure CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Adding a hydroxyl group at position 4 would make it: CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Hydrogen count: Each CH2 has 2 H, the C=O has none, the CH(OH) has 1 H (since it's a double bond?), wait no.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3? No, perhaps it's more like CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. Let me count the hydrogens.

CH2 has 2 H on the first carbon.

CH2-C(=O): the second carbon is a carbonyl, so no H attached.

Third carbon: CH2 → 2 H.

Fourth carbon: CH(OH) → 1 H (since the hydroxyl is on the fourth carbon, attached to CH).

Fifth carbon: CH2 → 2 H.

Sixth carbon: CH3 → 3 H.

Wait, but the fourth carbon is CH(OH), so it's attached to three groups: the third (CH2), the fifth (CH2), and the OH. So the structure would have:

C1: CH2 (2 H)

C2: C(=O) (0 H)

C3: CH2 (2 H)

C4: CH(OH) (1 H)

C5: CH2 (2 H)

C6: CH3 (3 H)

Total H: 2 +0 +2 +1 +2 +3=10.

So the formula is C6H10O2. Which matches option C.

So the structure would have a conjugated C=O and C=C. Wait, no, because in this structure, the C=O is at C2, and the double bond is between C3 and C4? Or if the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it conjugated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the structure.

Suppose the compound is 4-hydroxy-3-hexen-2-one.

Structure: CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Let me correct: The double bond is between C3 and C4 (positions 3 and 4), making it conjugated with the carbonyl at C2.

So, structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 → no, that's not conjugated. Alternatively, the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it conjugated with the carbonyl.

So, structure would be:

CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3 → the double bond is between C3 and C4, so it's not conjugated with the carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think: conjugated enone would have the double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-R. So, in that case, the carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, lowering the wavenumber.

So the IR peak at 1700 would be the carbonyl, and the conjugated double bond would be at 1650.

So the structure would have a conjugated enone.

In that case, the formula would be C6H10O2.

So, the structure would be, say, CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, that's six carbons, but let me count:

CH2=CH (C1 and C2)
C(=O) (C3)
CH2 (C4)
CH(OH) (C5)
CH3 (C6)

Wait, that's six carbons:

1: CH2= 

Wait, no. Let me just count the carbons properly.

Structure: CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons:

C1: CH2=

C2: CH-

C3: C(=O)

C4: CH2-

C5: CH(OH)

C6: CH3.

So that's correct. Now, the hydrogen count:

C1: CH2= → 2 H.

C2: CH- → but since it's double bonded to C1, it's CH2? No, wait. Structure is CH2=CH-... So C1: CH2= (2 H), C2: CH- (with double bond, so no H attached? Or does it have one H? Because in CH2=CH, the C2 has one H.

So C1: 2 H.

C2: 1 H (since it's CH2=CH-).

C3: C(=O) → 0 H.

C4: CH2 → 2 H.

C5: CH(OH) → 1 H (since OH is attached, and it's connected to C4 and C6).

Wait, structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

C5: CH(OH) → connected to C4 and C6. So the structure is:

C4: CH2 → 2 H.

C5: CH(OH) → 1 H.

C6: CH3 → 3 H.

So total H: 2 (C1) +1 (C2) +0 (C3) +2 (C4) +1 (C5) +3 (C6) = 9 H. But the formula is C6H10O2, which has 10 H. So I must have missed one.

Ah, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Structure: CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3 → no, that's not conjugated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, but that's seven carbons. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, but that's seven carbons again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexenone with a hydroxyl group. Let's say, 3-hydroxy-2-cyclohexenone.

Cyclohexenone has a five-membered ring? No, a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with a ketone and a double bond.

So, structure: cyclohexenone with an OH group.

The formula would be C6H8O2. But our option is C6H10O2, which has two more hydrogens. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ring is not fully unsaturated. Let me think: cyclohexenone is C6H8O. But if there are two O's, maybe it's a dihydroxy structure, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted ring with two O's.

This is getting too complicated. Let me think about the mass spec again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. The fragment is at 45, which is 45/114 ≈ 40% of the molecular weight.

So, the molecule may lose a 69 fragment, leaving 45. What's 69 as a fragment? 69 is the molecular weight of something like C3H7O2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into two parts: 45 and 69. 45 could be a CH3COO− group, but that's 59. Hmm.

Wait, but 45 is 45. What's the formula for a 45 fragment? Let's think of possible combinations.

45 = 12a + 1b +16c.

Looking for a combination where a, b, c are non-negative integers.

Possible combinations:

- 3 carbons, 10 H, 2 O: 3×12=36, 10×1=10 → 36+10=46 → +2 O (32) → 78 → too high.

Wait, no. Let me try:

Looking for 45=12a +b +16c.

Try a=2: 24. Then 45-24=21. So 21= b +16c.

Possible c=1 → 16 → b=5. So formula is C2H5O.

But that's a possible fragment: CH2CH2O.

Wait, but (CH2)2O has a molecular weight of 44 (12×2 + 2×4 +16=24+8+16=48. No, that's 48.

Wait, another approach:

a=1: 12 → 45-12=33 →33= b +16c.

c=2 →32 → b=1 → formula C1H1O2 → CHOOH? That doesn't make much sense.

c=1 →16 → b=17 → which is impossible (too many H).

c=0 →33 → b=33 → impossible.

a=3 → 36 → 45-36=9 → 9= b +16c.

c=0 → b=9 → formula C3H9.

So a fragment of C3H9 with a molecular weight of 39 (3×12 +9=36+9=45). So yes. So the fragment could be C3H9. But what would that be? Perhaps a propyl group, but that's not very informative.

Alternatively, a=0: 45=0 +b +16c.

So 45= b +16c.

c=2 →32 → b=13 → too high.

c=1 →16 → b=29 → no.

c=3 →48 → too high.

So the only possible way is a=2, c=1, b=5 → formula C2H5O.

So the fragment is C2H5O. That could be an ethoxy group (OCH2CH2), which is 45? Let me compute: O has 16, CH2CH3 is 15 (12×2 +5=24+5=29? Wait, no. OCH2CH3 is 16 +15=31. Hmm, that's not 45. So perhaps a different approach.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketone group, like (CH3)CO, which is (12×2) + (3×1) +16 → 24 +3 +16=43. Close, but not 45.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is a methyl group attached to a ketone, like CH3CO. That's (12×2 +1×4 +16)=24+4+16=44. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a propyl group with an oxygen, like OCH2CH2CH3. That would be 16 + (3×15) =16+45=61. No, that's higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck on this. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the spectroscopic data.

The IR suggests O-H (broad), C=O (1700), and C=C (1650) perhaps. The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond.

The mass spec shows a fragment at 45, which is a key clue.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Possible structure: an ester with a double bond and an O-H. Wait, but esters don't have O-H. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, a diol with a ketone and a double bond. But the formula has two O's.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a diethyl maleate or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters have the structure RCO-COOR', which would have two carbonyl groups. But then the IR would show two strong peaks around 1700. The given IR has peaks at 1700 and 1650, which could fit a conjugated ester.

But if it's a beta-keto ester, the O-H would have to come from somewhere else, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid derivative, but I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should make a decision based on the data.

The IR suggests O-H, which is either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The presence of C=O and C=C suggests a conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond.

The molecular formula with two O's (option C) would allow for an alcohol and a ketone, but I'm not sure about the mass spec.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment at 45 is a ketone group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. If the fragment is 45, what's 114 -45=69. 69 could be the rest of the molecule. What's 69 in terms of a formula? 69=12a +b +16c.

Looking for a combination:

a=3 →36. 69-36=33. 33= b +16c.

c=2 →32. So b=1. So a=3, c=2, b=1 → formula C3H1O2. That's not possible, as H can't be 1.

a=2 →24. 69-24=45. 45= b +16c.

c=2 →32. b=13 → impossible.

c=3 →48 → 45-48= negative. So no.

Alternatively, a=4 →48. 69-48=21. 21= b +16c.

c=1 →16 →b=5. So formula C4H5O.

Which would be something like CH2=CHCH2CHO → but not sure.

Alternatively, a=1 →12. 69-12=57= b +16c.

c=3 →48 → b=9 → formula C1H9O3. Not possible.

Hmm, this isn't working.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2. Because the IR data suggests an O-H, a carbonyl, and a conjugated double bond. The NMR has vinyl H, and the mass spec fragment is 45, which would fit with a structure that has a conjugated enone and an alcohol group.


The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are:

- **A)** C₆H₁₂O₂  
- **B)** C₆H₁₀O  
- **C)** C₆H₁₀O₂  
- **D)** C₆H₁₂O  

### Key Analysis:

1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
   - Two strong peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond (C=C).

2. **1H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (H attached to a double bond) confirm the presence of a double bond in the structure.

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45. Possible candidates for this fragment include groups like CH₃CO (43) or related species, though the exact identity remains unclear.

4. **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU)**:
   - The DoU formula is:  
     \[
     \text{DoU} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H - X + N)}{2}
     \]
     For the given options:
     - **A)** C₆H₁₂O₂: DoU = 1 (insufficient for both a carbonyl and a double bond, so invalid).  
     - **B)** C₆H₁₀O: DoU = 2 (possible for a carbonyl and a double bond).  
     - **C)** C₆H₁₀O₂: DoU = 2 (possible for a carbonyl and a double bond).  
     - **D)** C₆H₁₂O: DoU = 1 (insufficient for both a carbonyl and a double bond, so invalid).  

5. **Structural Considerations**:
   - The IR data suggests a compound with an O-H group, a carbonyl group, and a conjugated double bond. This aligns with a structure like a **beta-keto acid** or an **alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone** with an alcohol group.
   - The NMR data supports the presence of a double bond, consistent with the IR data.

6. **Mass Spectrometry Fragment**:
   - The fragment at **m/z = 45** could correspond to a smaller group such as CH₃CO (43) or a related species. This is more consistent with a compound like **C₆H₁₀O₂**, which could fragment into such groups.

7. **Elimination of Options**:
   - **A** and **D** are eliminated due to insufficient degrees of unsaturation.  
   - Between **B** and **C**, **C** is more likely because it accounts for both the O-H group and the additional oxygen required for the carbonyl and conjugated double bond.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂**, as it satisfies the IR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data, including the presence of an O-H group, a conjugated carbonyl, and a double bond.

**Answer: C**
