Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That name tells me that the benzene ring has substituents in the 3 and 5 positions. Specifically, there's a nitro group (NO2) at position 5 and a bromine (Br) at position 3. Additionally, the ethan-1-one part means that there's a ketone group attached to the benzene ring, specifically at position 1 (which would be the same as position where the substituents are attached? Wait, no. Let me clarify. The numbering might be a bit tricky. Wait, the benzene ring's substituents are in the meta and para positions relative to each other. Wait, no, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. Oh, wait, when the ketone is attached to the benzene ring, it's in position 1, so the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to that position. So the benzene ring has three substituents: a ketone (C=O) at position 1, a nitro group at position 5, and a bromine at position 3. Wait, wait, no. Because the full name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethan-1-one. So the structure is: the ethan-1-one is (CH2)0COCH3? No, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH2)COCH3. Wait, no. Ethyl group with a ketone at the first carbon. So it's CH3-CO- attached to the benzene ring. So, the benzene ring is attached to a ketone (C=O) group, which is attached to a CH3.
