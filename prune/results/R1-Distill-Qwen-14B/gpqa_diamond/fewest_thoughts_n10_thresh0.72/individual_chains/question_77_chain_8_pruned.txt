Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about some organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I need to figure out the major products for each of the given reactions and then select the correct option from A to D.

Let me start by breaking down the problem. The question has two parts: the first reaction involves BuLi and H+, and the second is a Cope rearrangement induced by heat. I'll tackle each part separately.

First Reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+.

BuLi is a strong base, often used to deprotonate compounds. I remember that when it's used on something with an ether group, like an epoxide, it can open the epoxide. Wait, but here the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So the benzene ring is connected to a CH2-O-CH2-C3H6 group, where the C3H6 has a double bond at position 2 (but-2-en-1-yl). So the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-, so the structure would be Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, but the molecule is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So the benzene is attached to a CH2-O group, and the oxygen is connected to the 1-yl position of 3-methylbut-2-en. So the structure is Ph-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but with the substituents. Oh, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2-? No, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carb
