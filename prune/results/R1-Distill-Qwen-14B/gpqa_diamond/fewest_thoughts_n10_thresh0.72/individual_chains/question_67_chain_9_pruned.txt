Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says we have two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. L is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is its z-component.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements give eigenvalues of -ħ.

Hmm, okay. So each Lz (for each electron) has eigenvalues mħ, right? Because for a single particle, Lz |l,m> = mħ |l,m>.

Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with a coupled state. So the state is |l1, l2, L, M>, which is |1,1,2,-1>.

I think when you have two particles, the individual angular momenta are l1 and l2, each with their own m1 and m2, and the total is L = l1 + l2 when they're in the same direction, but that's not always the case. Wait, no, I think the total angular momentum L is the vector sum of l1 and l2, so L = l1 + l2, but in terms of quantum numbers, you have to consider all possible couplings.

Wait, but in this problem, we're given that the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. That means that each electron has l=1 (so p orbital), and the total angular momentum L is 2, and the z-component M is -1.

So the state is a combination of the two individual angular momenta. So when considering L1z and L2z, the individual components, we have to find the probability that both are -ħ.

Wait, but each L1z and L2z can have eigenvalues m1ħ and m2ħ, respectively. So for L1z, the eigenvalue is m1ħ, and similarly for L2z, m2ħ.

So the joint measurement would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because the eigenvalues would be (-1)ħ each. So we need
