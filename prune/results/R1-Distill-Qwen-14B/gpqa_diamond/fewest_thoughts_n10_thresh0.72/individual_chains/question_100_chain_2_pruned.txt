Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, that's a hydrocarbon. The possible structures for C3H6 are either propene (an alkene) or cyclopropane. Since the first reaction is bromination in CCl4, I'm thinking it's more likely an alkene because bromination in CCl4 usually refers to addition reactions, like adding HBr. So if A is propene, it would react with HBr in a bromination (probably using Br2 in CCl4 as a solvent).

So, A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), and when it undergoes bromination, it forms compound B. The bromination of propene would add HBr across the double bond. But wait, propene has two different positions for addition. Propene (CH2=CH2CH3) can add HBr to the central carbon, giving 1-bromopropane or 2-bromopropane. Wait, no. Let's think about the structure. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. When HBr adds across the double bond, the H adds to the less substituted carbon, and Br to the more substituted. So the addition would follow anti-Markovnikov. So the product would be CH2BrCH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is actually CH2=CHCH3. So when HBr adds, the H would add to the CH2, and Br to the CH3. So the product would be CH2BrCH2CH3? Wait, no, the structure might be CH2BrCH2CH3, which is 1-bromopropane, but wait, propene adding HBr would give 2-bromopropane, I think. Wait, no. Let me draw it.

Propene is CH2-CH2-CH3 (but actually CH2=CHCH3). When HBr adds to the double bond, the H adds to the
