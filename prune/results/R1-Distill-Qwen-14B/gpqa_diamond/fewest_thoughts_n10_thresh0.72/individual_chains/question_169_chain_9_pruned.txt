Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear decay, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about two different decay processes. The first one is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. They mentioned that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the decay becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E changes in this variant compared to the original.

Hmm, I remember that in nuclear decays, when particles are emitted, their energy distribution depends on the conservation laws, like energy and momentum. Also, the type of particles emitted plays a big role. Let's think about the original decay first.

In the original decay, two E and two V particles are emitted. I'm assuming E and V are charged particles, maybe electrons or something similar. The fact that E's spectrum is continuous suggests that there's a range of possible energies. The endpoint Q is the maximum energy an E particle can have. I remember that in beta decay, for example, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves a transition where energy and momentum are shared between particles.

Wait, but in beta decay, neutrinos are emitted along with electrons. The electrons have a continuous spectrum because they can take any energy from zero up to a maximum determined by the available energy after considering the neutrino's energy. So in the original case, maybe E and V are like beta particles and antineutrinos or something. But since both E and V are emitted, perhaps they share energy and momentum, leading to a continuous spectrum for E.

Now, in the variant, instead of two V particles, it's emitting one massless particle M. Wait, M is exotic and massless. Since it's massless, it must travel at the speed of light, so its energy is related to its momentum. Hmm, and being part of the decay, M would carry away some energy and momentum.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. In the first decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The products are 2B, which are presumably nuclei, and the other four particles: two E and two V. So for the first decay, the system emits these four particles. The E's have a continuous spectrum because they share energy with the V's. Each E can have a range of energies based on how the total energy is distributed among all emitted particles.

In the second decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So now, instead of two V's, there's one M. So the products are two B, two E, and one M. So the number of particles emitted is different. Let's think about the energy and momentum.

In the first case, with 2E and 2V, the decay has four particles. So when considering energy and momentum conservation, each E and V must have certain energies and momenta. Because the V's are probably of the same type (maybe like electrons and antineutrinos), and assuming they are light, their energy is small compared to the mass of A. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the problem says E and V are much lighter than A and B, so their rest mass is negligible compared to the mass of A and B. So when considering energy, their kinetic energy is what matters.

In the original decay, because there are two E and two V, the E particles can't have a fixed energy because their energies depend on how the total available energy is shared. That's why the spectrum is continuous; each E can have a range of energies.

In the variant, we're emitting M instead of two V's. Since M is massless, its energy is purely kinetic and equals its momentum times c. So when considering the decay, the energy and momentum have to be conserved. M is a single particle, so its direction and energy are fixed more?

Wait, but in the original decay, we have two V's
