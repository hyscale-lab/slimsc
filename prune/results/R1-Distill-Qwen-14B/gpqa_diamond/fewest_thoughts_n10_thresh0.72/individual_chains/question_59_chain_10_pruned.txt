Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. And there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I should figure out how much acid and base I have in total, and then see if they neutralize each other or if there's excess acid or base left.

Wait, but wait. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So, the reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 will probably be a neutralization reaction, producing water and a salt. Then, any excess acid or base will affect the pH.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the moles of each acid and base.
2. Determine the net moles of H+ and OH- after mixing.
3. Find out which is in excess, if any.
4. Then, calculate the concentration of the excess H+ or OH-.
5. Finally, find the pH using the concentration.

Wait, but wait another thing. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But when you mix it with strong acid or base, how does that affect it? Hmm, maybe I should first handle the strong acid and strong base reaction, because that will determine if there's excess H+ or OH-.

Let me calculate the moles for each component.

First, moles of CH3COOH (weak acid):
Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Concentration is 0.1 M. So moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles.

Next, moles of HCl (strong acid):
Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Concentration 0.2 M. Moles = 0.4 * 0.2
