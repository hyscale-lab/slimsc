Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about two compounds, A and B, being treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to choose the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, wait. The reagents mentioned are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Oh, right! I remember that when you have something like an alcohol reacting with nitrous acid (which is formed from HCl and NaNO2), it's usually involved in some kind of elimination or nitrosation reaction. Or wait, maybe it's more about the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, another thought: I think that when an alcohol is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it might undergo a process called the Stephen reduction or maybe a nitroso reaction. Oh wait, no, Stephen is for ketones to aldehydes. Alternatively, I remember that if you have a secondary alcohol under certain conditions, it can form an oxime, but those are usually with hydroxylamine. Hmm.

Wait a second, another possibility: the treatment described might be a diazotization reaction. Diazonium salts are typically formed from aromatic amines, but that's for substitution reactions. But wait, the product here is a diketone. So maybe the starting material isn't an aromatic compound but a ketone or an alcohol that can form a ketone
