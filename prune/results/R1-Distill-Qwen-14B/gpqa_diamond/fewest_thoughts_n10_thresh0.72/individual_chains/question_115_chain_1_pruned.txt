Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic collisions and photon direction. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factors—so gamma is given for each. Hmm. The Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need to find v directly. Since the problem is about conservation of energy and momentum, I think I need to use that.

So, in any collision, both energy and momentum are conserved. Since the electron and positron are annihilating, their rest mass energy will contribute to the photons' energies. The rest mass energy of an electron is mc², which is about 0.511 MeV. Since a positron is the antimatter counterpart, it has the same rest energy.

So, the total rest mass energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. But wait, they're moving, so their total energy is gamma * mc² each.

Wait, the electron has gamma =4, so its energy is 4 * 0.511 MeV. The positron has gamma=2, so its energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV. So total energy before annihilation is 4*0.511 + 2*0.511 = 6*0.511 = 3.066 MeV. But wait, wait—wait a second. Because in the rest frame of the system, the total energy would be the sum of their rest masses plus their kinetic energies. But I'm not sure if I can just add their energies like that because the positron is moving towards the electron. But wait, when they annihilate, they produce photons. So the total energy of the photons must be the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Wait, but
