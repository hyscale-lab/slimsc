Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds absorbing light from quasars. Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms. But wait, the question is about redshift and optical ground-based telescopes.

So, redshift happens when a light source is moving away from us, which stretches the wavelength. The formula I think I need is the redshift formula for the Lyman alpha emission. Oh wait, wait, the Lyman alpha line is usually in the ultraviolet, right? But when it's redshifted, it moves into longer wavelengths.

The key here is that ground-based optical telescopes can't observe in the ultraviolet due to the atmosphere blocking those wavelengths. So the redshifted Lyman alpha must be in the optical range for us to detect it with such telescopes. 

The Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers or 121.6 nm. For optical telescopes, the visible spectrum is roughly from 400 nm to about 700 nm. Wait, no, ground-based telescopes can observe into the near-infrared as well, but optical is visible light. So the redshifted wavelength needs to be within the optical range, which I think is up to maybe 1 micrometer. But ground-based telescopes can go a bit into the infrared, but perhaps the question assumes optical as visible.

Let me think again. The observed wavelength lambda_obs is equal to (1 + z) times the rest wavelength lambda_rest. So lambda_obs = (1 + z) * 1216 Angstrom.

We need lambda_obs <= maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. What's the upper limit? I think optical is up to about 1000 nm (1 micrometer). Wait, but for ground-based, maybe up to 2 micrometers? Hmm, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So perhaps the lower redshift corresponds to the Lyman alpha being just in the optical range.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the lower limit on redshift would be the smallest z where the Lyman alpha is just visible in optical. Because if z is too small, the wavelength would be too short (still UV) and not detectable by optical telescopes.

So, to find the minimal z where lambda_obs is just in the optical range. Let's assume optical telescopes can observe up to about 1 micrometer (1000 nm) which is 10,000 Angstrom. Hmm, wait, 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, which is 10,000 Angstroms. Wait, no, 1 nm is 10 Angstrom, so 1216 Ang is 0.1216 microns. 1000 nm is 1 micrometer, which is 10,000 Ang. So, if the observed wavelength must be less than or equal to 10,000 Ang, then we can find z.

Wait, but wait, optical telescopes don't go that far. Maybe I should think about visible light. Visible light is about 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Ang. So if the Lyman alpha is observed at 4000 Ang (which is 400 nm), then (1+z) = 4000 / 1216. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216 is approximately 3.29. So z would be about 2.29. So the redshift has to be at least about 2.29 to bring the Lyman alpha into the visible range.

Wait, but that's the threshold. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift—so anything beyond that would be detectable. So the minimal z is when lambda_obs is 400 nm (if we're considering visible). So z is about 3.29 - 1 = 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is close. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than that. Hmm. Or wait, maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, let's check: (1 + z) = lambda_obs / lambda_rest. So if lambda_obs is say 400 nm, which is 4000 Ang. Then (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29. So the minimal redshift is around 2.3. The options are C)2.4 and D)1.9.

Wait, but perhaps the maximum wavelength observed is longer. Maybe the optical can go up to 1000 nm, which is 1 micrometer, so 10,000 Ang. Then (1 + z
