Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. Also, the FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. 

Wait, di-substituted aromatic ring—so it's a benzene ring with two substituents. The molecular formula isn't given, but the total carbons are 8. Let's think: benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents add 2 more. Oh wait, but wait, the substituents could have more carbons if they're groups like -CH2CH3 or something else. Or maybe one substituent is a group with multiple carbons.

So, the IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents on the benzene ring must include a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, the aromatic-halogen bond is in the ring. So one substituent is halogen, like Cl, Br, I. And the other substituent has a carbonyl group. So, for example, maybe one substituent is -X (like Cl) and the other is an acetyl group (like -COCH3) or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are -OAc (which has a carbonyl) and -X. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the possibilities. The substituents are two groups attached to the benzene ring. One is halogen (since aromatic-halogen bond is present) and the other has a carbonyl group.

So, the possible structures could be like para-substituted or ortho-substituted.

Let me think about the NMR. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s). That's a strong singlet. High ppm, maybe an aldehyde proton? But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But if this is in an aromatic ring, maybe it's an aromatic proton, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde group. But wait, the carbonyl group is present, so maybe the substituent is an aldehyde. But wait, in an aromatic compound, having an aldehyde substituent would be a meta director. However, if it's an aldehyde, its proton would be a singlet as it's not split by adjacent protons. But wait, aromatic rings with substituents can have other protons. Let me think about what the other peaks are. Option A has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). Those seem like aromatic protons. Maybe it's para-substituted? So if one substituent is an aldehyde (CHO) and another is a halogen, perhaps para to each other.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is an acetophenone group. So one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a CH3, like -COCH3. The carbonyl would be present. So for acetophenone, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl (the CH3) would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. But in option A, there's a 3.7 ppm (2H, s), which is more like a OCH2 group or something else.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The compound has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons. So two substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a single carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons, the other has none (like a halogen). Wait, halogens are one substituent, so the other substituent must have one carbon, but wait, a carbonyl group would require at least a CO group attached. Hmm, no. Because if the substituent is something like -COCH3, that's two carbons (the CO and the CH3). Wait, no: the substituent would be -COCH3, which is two carbons (the carbonyl is part of the substituent). So benzene (6) plus substituents (COCH3 has 2 carbons, and the other substituent is X, which is one substituent but no extra carbons) would give 6 + 2 = 8? Wait, no. Because the substituents are attached to the ring, so the ring is 6 carbons, and the substituents add to that. Each substituent is a group attached to one carbon of the ring. So if each substituent is a single atom (like X), that's 6 + 0 = 6 carbons, but that's not matching. Wait, the question says the compound has 8 carbons in total. So 6 from benzene plus 2 from substituents. So substituents must add 2 carbons in total.

So one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), which doesn't add any carbons. The other substituent must be a group with two carbons. So, substituents could be, for example, a carbonyl group attached to a CH3 (like -COCH3) and a halogen. Because the -COCH3 adds two carbons, and the halogen adds none. So total is 6 + 2 = 8.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with a halogen (X) and a ketone group (like -COCH3) attached. Now, the positions could be para, meta, or ortho. Considering the substituents, for maximum stability, the ketone is a meta director but the halogen is also a meta director. But that might not matter for the NMR.

Now, looking at the NMR options. Let me analyze each option.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s)—probably an aldehyde proton. Then 7.8 and 7.6 (each 2H, d), so perhaps a di-substituted ring where the two substituents are in para positions, giving a symmetrical structure. The 3.7 ppm (2H, s) could be a methylene group attached to something, perhaps OCH2. But wait, in the substituents, we have a carbonyl and a halogen. So acetophenone's CH3 would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. So Option A doesn't have that. So in option A, the 3.7 ppm is 2H, which suggests maybe a group like OCH2, but our substituent is a ketone group (so OCH2 wouldn't make sense here). Alternatively, maybe a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Hmm. Not sure.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm (each 2H, d). Those are upfield, like for CH2 groups attached to oxygen, perhaps OCH2CH2O. But wait, the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen. So maybe this is a di-substituted benzene with OCH2CH2O as a substituent? But that would add more carbons. Wait, the total carbons are 8. If substituent is OCH2CH2O, that's 2 carbons, but where else? But the carbonyl would be another substituent. So perhaps the substituents are OCH2CH2O and a carbonyl group. But that seems a bit complicated. Also, the presence of those 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggests perhaps a vicinal diol or an ether linkage. I'm not sure how this fits with the substituents we're considering.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d): this looks like a para-substituted benzene. Then 2.3 ppm (3H, s). A singlet at 2.3 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (like acetophenone's CH3). So the substituents would be a carbonyl group (like COCH3) and another substituent, perhaps a halogen. So the ring would have a COCH3 at one position and a halogen (like Cl) at the para position. 

So the NMR would show two doublets (each 2H) for the aromatic protons, and a singlet for the CH3. Thus, option C has those peaks. Let's check if this fits with the substituents.

Yes, because the COCH3 substituent would give a singlet at around 2.3 ppm, and the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets if the substituents are para. The other substituent is a halogen, which doesn't contribute protons, so the aromatic protons would be in a pattern of two doublets. So option C seems to fit.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 ppm singlet suggests maybe a single aromatic proton, perhaps in a meta position. The 4.8 and 4.6 ppm are again like CH2 groups attached to something else, maybe esters or ethers. The 1.3 ppm (2H, s) could be a methyl group somewhere. Not sure how this fits. Also, the substituents would need to include a carbonyl.

Wait, but our substituents are a carbonyl (COCH3) and a halogen. So option D doesn't seem to fit, as it doesn't have a peak for the CH3 of the ketone.

So, going back, the correct structure is a benzene ring with a COCH3 group and a halogen, para to each other. The NMR would have two doublets for the aromatic protons, and a singlet for the CH3.

Looking at the options, option C has 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). That matches the expected pattern.

Wait, but why is the 7.8 and 7.6 peaks each 2H? Because in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the aromatic protons would split into two sets. Let me draw that.

If the ring has substituents at para positions, each substituent is opposite each other. So each substituent (e.g., COCH3 and Cl) would cause the adjacent protons to split into two sets. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent (each a doublet) and protons at positions 3 and 5 would be another set of doublets.

Wait, no. Wait, if the substituents are at para positions, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. So the remaining four positions have hydrogens. The substituents are each in the 1 and 4 positions, so the hydrogens are at 2,3,5,6. If substituents are strong deactivating groups (like -COCH3 and -X), the ring may have certain symmetry.

Wait, actually, when a benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions, the remaining four protons are in two sets of two equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are at 1 and 4, the protons at 2 and 6 are ortho to substituent 1, and protons at 3 and 5 are meta.

So their chemical shifts might be different, leading to two doublets. Each doublet has 2H. So in the NMR, you see two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The 2.3 ppm is the COCH3's CH3 as a singlet. So that makes sense.

So option C is a good candidate.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options. Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm. That might be an aldehyde group. But if the substituent is an aldehyde (CHO), then the other substituent would be a halogen. So the ring would have substituents CHO and X. But how many carbons would that be? Benzene (6) + CHO (1 C) + X (0 C) = 7 C. But the question says the compound has 8 C. So that doesn't fit. So option A's structure would have 7 carbons, so it's out.

Option D has a singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H, s), which is unusual. It might be a proton on a substituent, like a methyl group attached to something. But I don't see how that would fit with the substituents we have. So probably not D.

Option B has two doublets for 2H each and some other peaks. The peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 might be from something like an OCH2CH2O group, but that would require more carbons. Let's see: benzene (6) plus OCH2CH2O (2 C) and a carbonyl (like CO?), but then the carbons would be 6 + (2 in substituent) + 1 in CO? That would be 9, which is more than 8. So that doesn't fit. So option B is out.

So the correct answer must be option C.


The question involves identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The compound contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The substituents on the benzene ring are one halogen (X) and one carbonyl-containing group.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Compound**:  
   - The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons.  
   - The two substituents contribute 2 additional carbons.  
   - One substituent is a halogen (X), which does not add any carbons.  
   - The other substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, such as -COCH3 (acetophenone-like group), which contributes 2 carbons.  
   - The total number of carbons is 6 (benzene) + 2 (substituents) = 8, which matches the given data.

2. **Substituent Effects on NMR**:  
   - The carbonyl group (-COCH3) is electron-withdrawing and meta-directing.  
   - The halogen (X) is also electron-withdrawing and meta-directing.  
   - For a para-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons split into two sets of doublets due to the symmetry of the molecule.  
   - The methyl group (CH3) attached to the carbonyl appears as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, but this would result in only 7 carbons in total (6 from benzene + 1 from CHO), which does not match the given data.  
   - **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest CH2 groups, likely part of an ether or ester. However, this would require additional carbons beyond the 8 specified, making it inconsistent with the total carbon count.  
   - **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) correspond to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 2.3 ppm matches the methyl group of a carbonyl-containing substituent. This option fits the structure and spectral data.  
   - **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) is unusual and does not align with the expected aromatic or substituent protons. Additionally, the peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest CH2 groups, which are inconsistent with the substituents identified.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen. The NMR data in **Option C** matches the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for this structure.

Answer: C
