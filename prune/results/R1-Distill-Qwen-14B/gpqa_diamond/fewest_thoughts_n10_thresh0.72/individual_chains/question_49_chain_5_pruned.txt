Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I've learned a bit about these, but I need to think carefully.

The question has three parts (A, B, C) with different starting materials and conditions, and I need to match each to the correct product from the options.

First, the first reaction is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to give A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure is like N-(methoxy)2CH2CH3? Or maybe more accurately, it's CH2N(OCH3)2. Oh wait, no, wait: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be on the ethyl group. So structure is (OCH3)2CHNH2? Or maybe it's (OCH3)2NCH2CH3? Wait, no, the amine is on the nitrogen. So it's H2N-C(OCH3)2CH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the first carbon, which is the carbon attached to the NH2. So structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because ethanamine is two carbons. Oh, wait: ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on the first carbon (the one attached to NH2). So the structure is CH(CH2OCH3)2NH2? Or wait, maybe it's (OCH3)2CH-NH2. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Let me think again. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine: the ethanamine is CH2CH3 with NH2 on the first carbon. So dimethoxy on the first carbon would be (OCH3)2CH-NH2. So the structure is an ethyl group where
