Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the net potential energy of a system when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. 

Hmm, alright, the setup is that there's a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I'm supposed to calculate the net potential energy of this system. The options are all mathematical expressions involving k, q, d, and R, so I need to think about how each contributes.

Wait, I remember that potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done to bring charges together. But this involves a conducting sphere, which might complicate things because the charges redistribute on the conductor.

Let me think. The conducting sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to the Earth, so any charge on it can flow in or out. But wait, if the sphere is neutral initially, when a charge q is placed nearby, the charges in the conductor will redistribute.

Oh right! When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges will rearrange. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can leave, but wait, in this case, the sphere remains neutral. No, wait, no. Because when you bring a charge near a grounded conductor, the induced charges can neutralize each other, but wait, no, because the conductor is grounded, any induced charges can move to ground. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, the conductor
