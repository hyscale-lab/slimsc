Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting because in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate them. So how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate. One of them, Ampère's Law with Maxwell's correction, deals with the circulation of the magnetic field. Oh wait, no, Ampère's Law actually relates the integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop to the current passing through it. Wait no, Ampère's Law is for the curl of H, but in Maxwell's equations, we usually have the curl of B equals μ0 times the current plus displacement current.

Oh right, Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me list them:

1. Gauss's Law for Electric Fields: divergence of E equals rho/epsilon0.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields: divergence of B equals zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: curl of E equals negative the time derivative of B.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: curl of B equals mu0 times J plus mu0 epsilon0 times the time derivative of E.

Wait, in our universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism says that the divergence of B is zero. So that's the second equation. If in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would mean that divergence of B isn't zero anymore. Because isolated poles would mean that there's a net 'magnetic charge' density.

So in our universe, we have div B = 0. If magnetic monopoles exist, then div B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, just like Gauss's law for E has div E proportional to electric charge density.

So in that scenario, the second equation (divergence of B equals zero) would change. So the equation for the divergence of the magnetic field would be different. But which equation in Maxwell's set is that? That's the second equation, Gauss's Law for B.

So which Maxwell equations would be different? The second one, which is about divergence of B. What about the others?

Well, Faraday's Law (third equation) is about the curl of E and the time derivative of B—does that change? I don't think so because that's about induced electric fields due to changing magnetic fields, and the presence of isolated poles wouldn't directly affect that relation. Unless there's a magnetic current, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another equation: Ampère's Law, which is about the curl of B. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, does that equation change? Let me think. In our universe, Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the current density (J) and the displacement current (dE/dt). If there are magnetic monopoles, there would be something analogous to the magnetic version of Ampère's Law. Wait, actually, the Maxwell equations are symmetrized when you include magnetic monopoles. 

In our universe, the divergence of B is zero, and the divergence of E relates to charge. If we had magnetic monopoles, then div B would equal some
