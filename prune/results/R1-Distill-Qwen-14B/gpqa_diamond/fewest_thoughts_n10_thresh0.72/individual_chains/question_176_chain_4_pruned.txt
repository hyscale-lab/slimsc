Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about the state of a system and measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The question is asking for the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1 when measuring Q after P.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. And the probability of each outcome depends on the state of the system projected onto the corresponding eigenvector.

Wait, right. So first, I need to find the eigenstates (eigenvectors) and eigenvalues of the operators P and Q. Because when you measure P, the system collapses into one of P's eigenstates, and then measuring Q will depend on that new state.

Let me look at the given matrices for P and Q.

The operator P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P =
[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

And operator Q is a diagonal matrix:
Q =
[ [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -1] ]

Wait, so Q is diagonal, which means its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors. So, the eigenstates for Q are |1> = (1,0,0), |0> = (0,1,0), and |-1> = (0,0,1). That's helpful because the eigenstates are easy to identify.

But the initial state of the system is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, does that mean the state vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T? I should probably normalize it since quantum states are usually represented as unit vectors.

Let me calculate the norm of the state vector. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is
