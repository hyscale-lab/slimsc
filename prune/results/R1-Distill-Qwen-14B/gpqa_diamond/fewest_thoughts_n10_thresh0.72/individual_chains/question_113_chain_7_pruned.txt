Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question gives me the FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. My goal is to determine the chemical formula from the options given.

Starting with the FTIR. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, it's a very broad peak, which might suggest a hydrogen-bonded O-H, like in a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester? Or perhaps it's an alcohol, but I'm not sure yet. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than the usual carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl. So perhaps the molecule has two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one is conjugated, like a ketone and an ester or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests the presence of a double bond, maybe in a vinyl group or an aromatic ring. Wait, but an aromatic ring would have more complex splitting, not just a vinyl-like peak. So maybe it's a double bond, like in an ester group or an alkene.

Looking at the Mass Spec data: there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, CH3CO+ is 45 (since CH3CO is 45, but wait, CH3CO has a molecular weight of 43. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2O? No. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone or an aldehyde. Alternatively, think of the common fragments like the acetyl group (CH3CO+) which is 43? Or maybe the peak is from something else.

Wait, 4
