Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D with different resolutions.

Wait, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. So the lab frame lifetime τ would be gamma multiplied by τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is given by E/(m c²), right? Because for a relativistic particle, energy E equals gamma m c². So gamma equals E/(m c²). But wait, in particle physics, energy is often given in units where c=1, so m is in GeV/c², and E is in GeV. So maybe I can compute gamma as E/(m c²) but considering the units properly.

Wait, the mass is 3.41 GeV. Wait, mass is usually in GeV/c². Energy is GeV. So when I compute gamma, it's E / (m c²) = (E in GeV) / (m in GeV/c² * c²). Oh wait, since E = gamma m c^2, then gamma is E/(m c²), but when the units are such that c=1, like in natural units, this simplifies. So perhaps in this case, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c². Wait, but in natural units where c=1, then E = gamma m, so gamma would be E/m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918.

Wait, let me double-check. If E = gamma m c², and m is 3.41 GeV/c², then E = gamma * 3.41 GeV/c² * c² = gamma * 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E/(3.41 GeV) = 27 / 3.41. So that's about 7.918, right? So gamma is approximately 7.92.

So the lifetime τ in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So tau = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8 * 7.92 is about 63.36, so τ ≈ 63.36e-16 s = 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the minimum resolution. I think the resolution relates to the ability to distinguish the decay products' paths, which depends on the length over which the decay occurs. The minimum resolution (Δ) would be the distance
