Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what I can remember from my notes and textbooks.

The question gives an unknown organic compound and its 1H NMR data. The options are four different acetates: Cis-propenyl, Trans-propenyl, Cis-butenyl, and Trans-butenyl. I think the key here is to analyze the NMR signals and match them to the structure.

First, let me jot down the NMR data provided:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

I remember that in NMR, the integration gives the number of protons, and the splitting tells about neighboring protons. The singlet at 2.1 ppm is probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, maybe an ester. Because acetates have an ester group, like OAc, which would have a methyl group as a singlet. So the 2.1 ppm peak is likely the acetate's methyl.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a methyl group adjacent to something with two neighboring protons. Since it's a doublet, the splitting suggests one neighboring proton, but wait, wait. A doublet for 3H methyl would mean that each of those methyl protons is split by one neighboring proton. Wait, but a methyl group is three protons, so maybe it's connected to a CH2 group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me think about the structures. The options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, with cis or trans configurations. So I should probably draw structures for each option.

Propenyl is CH2CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- or something. Wait, propenyl is allyl group, which is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but the options are Cis and Trans for both propenyl and butenyl
