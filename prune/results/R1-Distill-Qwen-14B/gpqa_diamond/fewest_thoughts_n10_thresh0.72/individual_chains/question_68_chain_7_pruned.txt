Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there's a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The magnetic moment is given by mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. The particle is initially in a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. After this switch, the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. They're asking for the oscillation frequency.

Hmm. So I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of a particle aligns with it. But when the field changes direction, the spin precesses around the new field direction. This would cause the components of the spin in other directions to vary sinusoidally over time, leading to oscillations in the expectation values of the spin components.

Wait, but in this case, the initial field is along Z. So the particle is in a state aligned with the Z-direction. Then the field is turned off, so the particle is no longer in a magnetic field. But wait, no, because after that, another field is turned on along Y. Oh, okay, so the initial state is when the field is along Z, so the spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. 

So when the magnetic field is suddenly turned off and then turned on in the Y direction, the particle's spin will start to precess around Y. But since the spin is aligned along Z, which is perpendicular to Y, this should cause some oscillations in the Z-component of the spin.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you change the direction of the magnetic field, the Hamiltonian changes. Initially, the Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz, and then it becomes proportional to Sy. So the system evolves under a different Hamiltonian after the switch.

I think the key here is to model the time evolution of the expectation value of Sz after the field is changed. Because the oscillation in the average Sz would depend on the energy difference and the transition frequency between states.

Let me try to model this. The initial state is |up_z> because the magnetic moment is aligned with the Z field
