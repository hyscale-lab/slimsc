Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about two compounds, A and B, that when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Wait, the reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Oh right! That's the conditions for the Stephen reduction, or wait, no, wait. Sodium nitrite and HCl is often used for diazotization. Diazonium salts maybe. But wait, in what context? Oh, wait, when you have an alcohol and a nitroxide or something... Or maybe it's about the formation of ketones from alcohols via some kind of elimination?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Diazonium salts are typically from aromatic amines. But wait, maybe this is about the production of ketones through some kind of elimination reaction. Oh! Right, I remember now. When you have a secondary alcohol, treating it with nitrous acid (HNO2) in HCl and water can lead to the formation of a ketone. Oh right, it's the Stephen reduction? Or wait, no, Stephen is more about reducing ketones to alcohols. Alternatively, maybe it's the production of a carbonyl group from an alcohol via an elimination reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the Beckmann rearrangement? No, that's for oximes. Alternatively, the treatment of alcohols with nitrous acid can lead to the formation of carbonyl groups. Let me think. For secondary alcohols, when treated with nitrous acid under acidic conditions, they can form ketones through an elimination process. So, maybe that's what's happening here.

So the reaction is: secondary alcohol â†’ ketone upon treatment with NaNO2, HCl, and H2O.

So, the product is a diketone, which has two ketone groups. So the starting materials A and B must each have two alcohol groups, perhaps. Wait, no, because the treatment is per compound. Each starting material, when treated, gives a diketone. So each starting material must have two alcohol groups that, upon reaction, form two ketone groups. Wait, but
