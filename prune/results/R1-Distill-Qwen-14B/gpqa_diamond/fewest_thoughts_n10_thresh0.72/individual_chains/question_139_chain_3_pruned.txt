Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. Alright, the question is about two compounds, A and B, being treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. My task is to determine which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, first, I remember that sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and HCl are involved in nitrosation reactions. Wait, but in what context? Oh right, I think that's usually part of the diazotization process for aromatic amines. Diazonium salts are formed, right? But wait, in this case, the products are diketones. So maybe the starting materials are not aromatic but something else.

Oh wait! Diazotization is typically for amines, but maybe this is a different reaction. If the treatment is leading to diketones, perhaps it's a Beckmann rearrangement? Because I remember that Beckmann rearrangement involves the reaction of oximes with acid catalysts, leading to ketones. So, oximes (R-C=N-OH) when treated with HCl and heat can rearrange to form amides, which then lose water to form ketones.

Wait, but the reagents here are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh, another possibility is that the starting materials are hydroxyl amines. Hydroxyl amines on treatment with nitrous acid (which is generated from NaNO2 and HCl) might form N-nitrosamines or oximes.

Wait, so if the starting materials are secondary or primary alcohols, but that doesn't fit. Wait, noâ€”be careful. Let's think: when an alcohol is treated with nitrous acid, does that do anything? Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe it's about the formation of nitro compounds, but that's more for aromatic rings.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the starting materials are aldehydes or ketones. No, because the products are diketones. So perhaps the starting materials are diols, but that doesn't immediately ring a bell.

Wait, going back to the Bechamp reduction or something else. Oh wait, perhaps it's the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that involves ketones forming lactones or other groups.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the production of nitro groups, but that's not leading to ketones.

Wait, another approach: what reactions produce
