Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I know luminosity is the total energy a star emits per second. The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. But wait, wait. Wait, the mass probably doesn't directly affect luminosity unless we're talking about processes inside the star that generate energy, like fusion rates. But the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. Oh, right, black body radiation is more about the temperature and size. So maybe mass is a red herring here, or perhaps it's not needed for this calculation since they're using black body radiation formulas. Hmm, I'll keep that in mind.

The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength, right? Because for a black body, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898 ×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, because if λ_max is same, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, wait. Or is that correct? Because if the stars are moving towards or away from us, their wavelengths would be Doppler shifted. Oh right! The radial velocity comes into play here. The problem says that Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s.

Wait, the observed wavelength maximum is the same for both stars. But the actual peak emission of each star would be different because of their velocities. Hmm. So the star's own peak is determined by its temperature, but because of Doppler shift, what we observe might be different.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are
