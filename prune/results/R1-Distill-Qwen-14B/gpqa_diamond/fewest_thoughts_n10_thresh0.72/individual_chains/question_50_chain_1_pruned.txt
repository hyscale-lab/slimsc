Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop integrals. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says my colleague wrote down a "size estimate" next to a Feynman diagram that was rendered unreadable. The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4 pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to figure out how many loops the diagram had based on this expression.

Hmm, I remember that loop integrals in Feynman diagrams contribute to the overall amplitude of a process. Each loop usually adds some factors from the integral, and these factors often include things like powers of pi, constants like alpha (the fine-structure constant), coupling constants (like g), and possibly factors from group theory or combinatorics.

So, let's break down the given expression. The expression is:

alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4 pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

I think each loop contributes a certain number of powers. For example, in a one-loop diagram, the integral might involve terms like 1/(16 pi^2) in four dimensions (since the integral in four dimensions for a loop is usually divergent, but after regularization, you get factors like that). Wait, wait, no, wait. Let's think again.

Wait, the general form for loop integrals in four dimensions for a loop with L loops... Hmm, another approach: the number of loops relates to the superficial degree of divergence. Or maybe more straightforwardly, each loop contributes a 1/(16 pi^2) factor when you compute the amplitude, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, loop integrals often lead to terms like (loop momentum integrals) which introduce factors of 1/(16 pi^2) for each loop.

Wait, but let's think about the dimensional analysis. The term (Q/M) is a dimensionless ratio, so the rest of the factors must be dimensionless. Let's see: alpha is dimensionless, g is a coupling constant (dimensionless in natural units), sqrt(2) is just a number, 8 is a number, 4 pi is also in the denominator, so 1/(4 pi)^6 is 1/(
