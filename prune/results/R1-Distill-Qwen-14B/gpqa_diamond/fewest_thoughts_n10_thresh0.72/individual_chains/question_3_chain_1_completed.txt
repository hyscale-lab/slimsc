Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a spin-half particle. Hmm, I remember that spin-half particles, like electrons, have spin states that can be either up or down. The question says the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, σz is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1 for up and down respectively.

The problem is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh, expectation value calculation. I think that's when you take the bra-ket of the state with the operator, right? So, ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

Breaking it down, the expectation value of an operator A is ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. So this will be the sum of the expectation values of each term multiplied by their coefficients. So, the expectation value E = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

First, I need to compute ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that should be straightforward. The expectation value for σz is the probability of finding the particle in |↑⟩ times +1 (since σz|↑⟩=+1|↑⟩) plus the probability of |↓⟩ times -1.

Wait, the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them to get the probabilities. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which is 0.75. So the probabilities are 25% for up and 75% for down. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Then, what about ⟨σx⟩? Oh, σx is the Pauli x-matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But wait, since σx is Hermitian, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues. Alternatively, σx can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

The Pauli matrices: σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, when you apply σx to |↑⟩, which is [1;0], you get [0,1;1,0][1;0] = [0;1], which is |↓⟩. Similarly, σx |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

But to find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let's compute that. The state ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. So, ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Wait, when I compute ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩, it's (0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ) times σx times ψ. Wait, but σx is a matrix, so perhaps it's easier to compute it as ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, since σx = |→⟩⟨←| + |←⟩⟨→|, but maybe it's easier to just compute it directly.

Wait, let's compute σx ψ. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you multiply by ψ, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], you get [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ]^T. So σx ψ is [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

Then, ⟨ψ| (σx ψ) would be [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)* ] multiplied by [ sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5 ].

Wait, taking the conjugate, since all coefficients here are real, so it's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] multiplied by [ sqrt(3)/2, 0.5 ].

So the dot product is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2 ) * 0.5 = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So ⟨σx⟩ is 0.8660 approximately.

Alternatively, I could have used the formula for expectation values with spin-½ particles. Remember that the expectation value of σi is 2 times the expectation value of S_i (since σi = 2 S_i for spin-½), but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.

Wait, but σx is a Hermitian operator, and the eigenvalues are ±1. So the expectation value is (prob of +1) * 1 + (prob of -1) * (-1). But wait, how do I find these probabilities? Because the eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which aren't the same as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be written as a superposition in the σx basis, but that might be more complicated. But in this case, we did the calculation directly and got 0.866, which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So putting it all together: the expectation value E is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

10*(-0.5) is -5. 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 * 1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33. So adding them: -5 +4.33 = -0.67.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck the calculations.

Compute 10*⟨σz⟩: ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) is -5.

Compute 5*⟨σx⟩: ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660. So 5*0.8660 is approximately 4.33.

So E = (-5) +4.33 = -0.67.

Hmm, that's -0.67. But looking at the options, option C is -0.7, which is close. So our calculation is about -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.

Wait, let me re-calculate ⟨σx⟩. Because maybe I made a mistake there.

So ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So when I compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, which is ψ† σx ψ.

Alternatively, σx is represented as [[0 1],[1 0]]. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], so ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

σx ψ = [ (0)(0.5) + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) , 1*(0.5) + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) ]^T? Wait, no. Wait, the matrix multiplication is [0 1;1 0] times [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

So the first component is 0*0.5 +1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

The second component is 1*0.5 +0*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5.

So σx ψ = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] multiplied by [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

So 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3)/4), and the same term again, so total is sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, that's correct. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So, putting it back into the equation: 10*(-0.5)= -5. 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is approximately 4.3301.

Adding: -5 + 4.3301 = -0.6699. So that's approximately -0.67.

The question asks for the expectation value up to one decimal place. So -0.67 is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal. So the answer would be -0.7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I correctly compute the expectation value of σx?

Another approach: The operator σx in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ can be written as σx = [[0,1],[1,0]].

The expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Which is (0.5)(0.5)*0 + (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2)*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5)*1 + (sqrt(3)/2)(sqrt(3)/2)*0. Wait, no, that might not be the right way.

Alternatively, matrix elements are:

σx = [ [0,1], [1,0] ]

So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ]

Then, σx |ψ⟩ is [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ]

Then, ψ† (σx |ψ⟩) is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the calculation seems right. So E is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So the answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is given by:

\[
\langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The coefficients of \( \psi \) are \( 0.5 \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), so the probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \) are:

\[
P(+1) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, \quad P(-1) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (+1)(0.25) + (-1)(0.75) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state \( \psi \) can be written as a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), we calculate \( \sigma_x \psi \):

\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the dot product \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x \psi \):

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix} = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Thus, \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866).
\]

First, calculate \( 10(-0.5) = -5 \). Then, calculate \( 5(0.866) \approx 4.33 \). Adding these:

\[
-5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
