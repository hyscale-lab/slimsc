Okay, so I have this question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, which is usually in enolate form, attacks the beta carbon of the carbonyl, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Let me start with part A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). NaOEt is a strong base, so I think it deprotonates the malonate to form an enolate. Malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a conjugated dienolate or something like that.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. Wait, no, wait. The structure is actually CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. No, wait, no, wait. Wait, acrylate is like CH2=CHCOOEt, but in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So wait, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=C-O-CO-OEt? No, wait, no. Let me visualize it. The formula would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? Wait, I'm getting confused. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOMe. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have a substituent on the third carbon, but wait, there are only three carbons in acrylate: CH2-CH2-COO-. Oh wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOEt? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively
