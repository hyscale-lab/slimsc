Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Reaction I uses (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II uses pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 and then an acidic workup. The products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both normal-phase and a chiral one. I need to determine how many peaks show up in each chromatogram.

First, I should figure out what each reaction does and what the products are.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone group at position 3 will be reduced. The structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

O

C-OCH3

CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but wait, let me draw it correctly.)

Wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, let me count. Hexan has six carbons. 3-one means the ketone is on C3.

So, structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but the substituent is 5-methoxy. So, the fifth carbon from the end? Wait, numbering from which end? Let me think. Hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. No, perhaps better to write it as:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me structure it properly.

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the six-carbon chain has a ketone at position 3. The 5th carbon (counting from
