Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break it down.

First reaction: Heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has some specific signals, and there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Second reaction: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Third reaction: Ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR, excluding those that exchange.

So I need to figure out what each product is and then determine the NMR coupling for product 3.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, and heating usually leads to elimination reactions—like dehydrohalogenation. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so the positions of the bromines are adjacent in some way.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two bromines are on adjacent carbons? Or is the structure such that they're on opposite ends? Hmm, not sure. But when treated with KOH, especially in an elimination reaction, it would form an alkene. So product 1 is likely 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, let me think about the structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane might lead to a diene upon elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexene derivative. Alternatively, maybe it forms a bridge. Wait, but the IR of product 1 shows a strong absorption at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a carbonyl group, C=O. So that suggests the product isn't an alkene but a ketone or an ester. Wait, but KOH and heating in an elimination reaction... Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but followed by some rearrangement.

Wait, another possibility: elimination of HBr twice could form a double bond. But why the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹ which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. Wait, how?

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, maybe in a double E2 elimination. So each Br would leave, taking Hs with them. But wait, each elimination would form a double bond. Wait, but if two Brs are present, perhaps two eliminations happen, forming a conjugated diene? Or maybe an allene.

But the IR suggests a carbonyl. Alternatively, could it be a ring-opening or some rearrangement leading to a ketone?

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a carbene or something else. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: look at the NMR data of product 1. The 1H NMR shows:

4.79 (2H) – possibly a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Or maybe an alcohol, but considering the IR, which has a carbonyl, it's more likely an ester or ketone.

Wait, 4.79 ppm is a downfield shift, which is typical for protons next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an ester. So maybe these are the protons adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Looking at the integration: 4.79 (2H) could be two Hs, maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) – that's a lot of Hs. So perhaps a cyclohexyl group or multiple CH2 groups. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2.

Wait, the initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So perhaps, when KOH is added, it leads to the formation of a diketone? Or maybe a cyclohexane ring with ketone groups.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a diepoxide. But that would have different NMR shifts.

Wait, maybe the product is adamantanone. But how? Let me think about the structure.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings connected in a chair-like fashion. If it loses two HBr molecules, perhaps via dehydrohalogenation, it forms a ketone. Wait, but how would that happen?

Alternatively, maybe each Br is replaced by an OH,
