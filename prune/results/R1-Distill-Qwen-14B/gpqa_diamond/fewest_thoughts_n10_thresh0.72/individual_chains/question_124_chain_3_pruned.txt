Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let's try to break it down. Alright, the setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying, moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on Lorentz factors and particle decay. Let me think. So, Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Ultra-relativistic means v is very close to c, so gamma is large.

The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so they have to travel 30 meters to reach the inner wall. But since they're moving, their lifetime as experienced in the lab frame is gamma times their proper lifetime (tau). Oh right, because of time dilation. So the time it takes for them to reach the wall is the distance divided by their velocity. Wait, but since they're moving at a significant fraction of c, we need to consider how their lifetime affects whether they decay before reaching the wall.

So, particles that decay before reaching the wall won't make it. So the fraction that reach the wall depends on the probability that their lifetime (gamma * tau) is longer than the time it takes to travel the 30 meters.

Wait, the time they take to reach the wall is t = R / (v). But since v ≈ c for high gamma, we can approximate t ≈ R/(c). So t = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds, approximately.

Each particle has a proper lifetime tau. The probability that it survives to reach the wall is the probability that its lifetime is longer than t. Since the particle decays exponentially, the survival probability P is exp(-t/(tau)).

Wait, but if the lifetime is gamma tau, then t is the time in the lab frame. So for the particle to reach the wall, gamma tau must be greater than t. Or wait, no, the time t is the time it takes to
