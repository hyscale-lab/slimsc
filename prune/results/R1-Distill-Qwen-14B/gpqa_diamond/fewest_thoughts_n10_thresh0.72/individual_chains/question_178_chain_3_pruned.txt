Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the Lagrangian tells us a lot about the interactions and whether a theory is renormalizable. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, mass dimensions... Right, in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension is important for determining the renormalizability of the theory. The idea is that each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action (which is the integral of the Lagrangian) must be dimensionless in natural units (where ℏ and c are 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So, to find the mass dimension of κ, I need to look at each part of the term and compute their dimensions. Let's break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, I should recall the mass dimensions of the fields involved. The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension. I think for a Dirac field, the dimension is 3/2. Because the Lagrangian for the Dirac field is like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. The kinetic term must have dimension 4. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So each ψ has dimension 3/2, because [i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ] must be dimension 4. Let me check: ψ̄ is same as ψ, so 3/2 each. So 3/2 (ψ̄) + 3/2 (ψ) + 1 (∂) = 3 +1? Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ. So each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2 as well. Then the product ψ̄ γ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then multiplied by ∂ (dimension 1) gives 4. So that's right. So ψ has dimension [ψ] = 3/2.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? σ is defined in terms of the gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices, not fields), so σ_{μν} is a product of derivatives or fields? Wait no, σ is made from [γ_mu, gamma_nu], which are the gamma matrices. So σ_{mu nu} is a field operator? Or is it just a tensor constructed from the gammas, which are constants? Wait, no, σ is part of the interaction term, so it's probably an operator formed from the gamma
