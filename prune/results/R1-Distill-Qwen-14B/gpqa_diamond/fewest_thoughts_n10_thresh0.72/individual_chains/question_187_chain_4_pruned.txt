Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about what I know about ESPRESSO and signal-to-noise ratios.

First, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT (Very Large Telescope) in Paranal. I remember it's designed for things like exoplanet detection, so it must be sensitive and have good resolution. But how does that relate to detecting stars?

The question states that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to find out for each star option, whether their S/N meets or exceeds 10.

Wait, how is S/N calculated? I think it depends on the star's brightness, which is measured by its magnitude. The lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So more flux means higher S/N.

Absolute magnitude is given for some options. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 pc. So if a star is at a certain distance, I can calculate its apparent magnitude using the distance modulus formula.

The formula is: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs, and m is apparent magnitude.

Once I have the apparent magnitude, I can find the flux. The flux (f) is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), because brighter objects have lower magnitudes. But wait, how does this relate to S/N?

I think the signal in a spectrograph is proportional to the flux of the star. The noise, on the other hand, is usually due to the sky background and the readout noise, but I might be overcomplicating it. Maybe for this problem, we can assume that the noise scales with the square root of the signal. Wait, no, wait. The noise in a spectrum is often dominated by photon noise, which is sqrt(flux), but for a given exposure time and instrument parameters, the S/N per pixel depends on the star's flux.

Alternatively, perhaps each star's flux determines the S/N. So I need to know the flux, and then compute whether that flux, given the exposure time, results in S/N >=10.

But wait, I don't have the exact parameters of ESPRESSO. So maybe I can find a way to determine whether the star is bright enough.

Let me think: The ESPRESSO spectrograph is sensitive down to a certain magnitude. If I can find the faintest magnitude it can detect with S/N 10 in one hour, then I can compare each star's apparent magnitude to that threshold.

Alternatively, maybe the ESPRESSO data sheets or some notes mention the typical S/N per pixel for a given exposure time and star magnitude.

Wait, I remember that for a spectrograph, the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time. Also, the S/N per pixel depends on the number of photons collected. So if a star is brighter, more photons, higher S/N.

But perhaps, for this problem, the key is to calculate the apparent magnitude of each star and see if it's bright enough. Let me list each star's details.

Option a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.74. Since that's way brighter than any other options, it should definitely be detectable.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is a circumpolar star, but I'm not sure of its exact magnitude. I think it's around 2nd magnitude, so m ≈ 2. So that's bright, probably detectable.

Options c, d, e, f: all have absolute magnitude M =15. So let's compute their apparent magnitudes.

Option c: located at 10 pc. So for M=15, d=10 pc. So m = M + 5 log10(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15. That's a very faint star. Because absolute magnitude is 15, and it's at 10 pc, so m=15. So how does that compare? Wait, that's extremely faint. I think ESPRESSO can't detect such a faint star in one hour. Because for m=15, the flux is very low.

Option e: same M=15 but d=5 pc. So m =15 +5 log10(5/10) =15 +5*(-0.301) ≈15 -1.505 =13.495. So m≈13.5.

Option f: M=15, d=50 pc. m=15 +5 log10
