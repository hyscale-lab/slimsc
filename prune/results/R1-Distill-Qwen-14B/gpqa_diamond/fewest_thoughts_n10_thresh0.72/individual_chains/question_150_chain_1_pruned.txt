Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about identifying the final product after a series of reactions. The starting compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO and some given NMR data. The reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat.

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So that's (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2=4. So four degrees: could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's a triplet, maybe it's next to another group with two protons. Like if it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde attached to another proton, but that's unusual. Hmm.

Then, 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring, maybe with two substituents. The doublets with 2H each suggest a di-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, but if the aromatic protons are in a di-substituted ring, like para, they would be as two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that makes sense. Maybe the compound has two phenyl groups attached somewhere.

Next, 6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, two protons. That could be protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diol group. Or maybe in a conjugated system, like allylic or something else. Alternatively, it could be an enol proton or something. But a broad singlet is common for protons next to an oxygen, maybe in a hemiacetal or as an -OH, but wait, the integration is 2H. So maybe it's a group like CH2O, but more likely, perhaps a conjugated diene with some substituents. Hmm.

3.66 (d, 2H) – a doublet, integrating to 2H. That could be a -CH2- group next to something else. Maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to another CH2, but in a specific structure. Let me think.

Putting it all together. The starting material has two benzene rings because the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons. The aldehyde proton suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the compound is something like p-nitrobenzaldehyde but with more substit
