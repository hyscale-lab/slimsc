Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each being a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound (the Michael acceptor) by an enolate. The enolate acts as a nucleophile. So, in this case, dimethyl malonate is the nucleophile, and the other compound is the acceptor.

Wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it forms an enolate, the negative charge is on the alpha carbon (the central CH2). So, the enolate would attack the beta position of the acceptor.

The acceptor here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. The acrylate has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. The substituents on the double bond are at the 3 position is a p-tolyl group (a methyl group attached to a benzene ring at the para position). So the structure is CH2=C(CO2Me)(p-tolyl), but wait, no, wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CHCO2Me, but with the substituent on the second carbon.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. But if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would mean the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 in the acrylate.
