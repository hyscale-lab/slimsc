Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the exact concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by breaking down what's given and what's being asked.

The question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, 150 minutes is more than the initial 100-minute time frame... but I need to clarify because 50 minutes have already passed. Wait, no, the initial total time considered was 100 minutes, but now 50 have gone by, so they're asking about the next 150. That seems a bit confusing because 50 +150 is 200. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no, the decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. So I think that's the half-life or something related. Wait, no, the half-life is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay, but this is the total decay probability, not exactly the half-life. So perhaps it's more about the decay constant.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus decays in a certain time is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time.
