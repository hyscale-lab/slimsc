Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive decay. The question is asking about the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the past 50 minutes. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Hmm, wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key thing here is that the decay process is memoryless, which means the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, if the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability for the next 150 minutes shouldn't be affected by that initial 50 minutes, right?

But wait, let me make sure I'm not getting confused. The way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays any time up to 100 minutes from when we start monitoring. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes, but wait, 50 + 150 is 200 minutes. So does that mean we're looking for the probability over 200 minutes, but considering that the first 50 didn't happen?

Wait, maybe I should break this down. Let's clarify the timeline. When you start monitoring, the total time you're considering is 100 minutes, with a 32% chance of decay. So the decay constant λ can be found from this.

The decay formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λ t). The probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λ t). So for t=100 minutes, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. So e^(-100 λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural log: -100 λ = ln(0.68) → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, but wait! The question is about the probability after 50 minutes have passed without decay, and then in the next 15
