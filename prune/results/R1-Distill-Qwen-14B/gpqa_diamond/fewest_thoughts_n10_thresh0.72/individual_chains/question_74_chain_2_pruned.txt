Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the exact concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by breaking down what's given and what's being asked.

The question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, 150 minutes is more than the initial 100-minute time frame... but I need to clarify because 50 minutes have already passed. Wait, no, the initial total time considered was 100 minutes, but now 50 have gone by, so they're asking about the next 150. That seems a bit confusing because 50 +150 is 200. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no, the decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. So I think that's the half-life or something related. Wait, no, the half-life is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay, but this is the total decay probability, not exactly the half-life. So perhaps it's more about the decay constant.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability that a nucleus decays in a certain time is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time.

Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive decay. The question is asking about the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for the past 50 minutes. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Hmm, wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key thing here is that the decay process is memoryless, which means the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, if the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, the probability for the next 150 minutes shouldn't be affected by that initial 50 minutes, right?

But wait, let me make sure I'm not getting confused. The way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. It says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays any time up to 100 minutes from when we start monitoring. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes, but wait, 50 + 150 is 200 minutes. So does that mean we're looking for the probability over 200 minutes, but considering that the first 50 didn't happen?

Wait, maybe I should break this down. Let's clarify the timeline. When you start monitoring, the total time you're considering is 100 minutes, with a 32% chance of decay. So the decay constant λ can be found from this.

The decay formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λ t). The probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λ t). So for t=100 minutes, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. So e^(-100 λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural log: -100 λ = ln(0.68) → λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, but wait! The question is about the probability after 50 minutes have passed without decay, and then in the next 15
