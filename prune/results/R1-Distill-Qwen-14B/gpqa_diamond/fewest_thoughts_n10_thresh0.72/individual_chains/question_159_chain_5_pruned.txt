Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their spectrum, and I need to figure out the comoving distance based on some cosmological parameters. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. Then, the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that in astronomy, when you see a peak in the spectrum, it's often related to some emission line. Like, the Lyman-alpha line is around 121 nm, but that's in the ultraviolet. Wait, but here the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared. Oh wait, that's longer than visible light. Hmm.

Wait, maybe this has to do with redshift. Because if the quasar is moving away from us, its emitted light would be stretched to longer wavelengths. So if the quasar emits a certain line at a specific wavelength, but we observe it at a longer wavelength, that must mean it's been redshifted. 

So, let's think. Suppose the quasar emits a certain line at a rest wavelength. Maybe the peak is an emission line. For example, the Lyman-alpha emission line is about 121.6 nm. But if we observe it at 790 nm, that would mean (790 / 121.6) = about 6.5 times longer. So the redshift z would be (observed / rest) - 1. So 790/121.6 is approximately 6.5. Subtract 1 gives z=5.5. But wait, quasars are very distant, so high redshifts are possible. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the peak is something else. Oh, wait, another thought: the peak in the spectrum could be the so-called Lyman limit, which is around 91.2 nm. But 790 is way longer than that. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer series â€” wait, hydrogen's Balmer lines are in the visible spectrum, but that's for lower redshifts. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, I'm confusing with other elements' emission lines. Maybe it's a different line. Alternatively, maybe the peak is the 21 cm line of hydrogen, but that's in the radio, so much longer wavelengths. Hmm, not matching here.

Wait, perhaps the peak is the Lyman break. The Lyman break is a feature in the spectrum where wavelengths shorter than the Lyman limit (91.2 nm) are absorbed by neutral hydrogen. So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, maybe the quasar's rest frame has this line at a shorter wavelength. Wait, no, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the quasar's rest frame has its peak at a certain wavelength, and due to redshift, it's observed at 790 nm. 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Lyman series. The Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm. So if that line is observed at 790 nm, that would imply a redshift z = (790 / 121.6
