Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can go 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens live for about 150 Earth years on average. Their astronaut is 22 years old, and they want to reach Earth. The question is, from the astronaut's perspective, how long will the trip take? And the options are whether they'll die before reaching, or how many years it'll take.

Wait, right, this is a question about special relativity, specifically time dilation. Because when you travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of a stationary observer, and the moving observer (the astronaut) experiences less time. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, in the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted, so the time experienced (proper time) would be shorter.

Wait, so I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut. Let me think about the formula for time dilation in special relativity. The proper time τ is the time experienced by the traveler. The formula is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame.

But wait, maybe I should first calculate the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth, and then determine how long it takes from Earth's frame, then apply time dilation.

Wait, what's the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud? I think the LMC is about 160,000 light-years away. So that's the distance. Let me just note that as approximately 160,000 light-years.

So in Earth's frame, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. Let me compute the time it takes for the trip from Earth's perspective. Time is distance divided by speed. So time t is (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since the speed is very close
