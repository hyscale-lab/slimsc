Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that means it's like benzene with two substituents attached. The FTIR shows ester groups, so there's an O-C-O linkage. Esters usually have a carbonyl group (C=O) which absorbs around 1740 cm^-1, right? So that's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me break them down. Two are aromatic protons. Two are vinyl-H, one as a doublet and another as a doublet of quartets. And two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals. Hmm.

So, the aromatic ring has two substituents. Let me think about possible structures. Since there's ester group, perhaps one substituent is an ester. Wait, but the ring is di-substituted, so two groups attached.

Ester group is R-O-C-O-R', so maybe one substituent is an ester, like O-CO-O-R. Alternatively, maybe it's an acyloxy group attached to the benzene. Wait, but the aromatic protons are two signals, which suggests that the substituents are in certain positions.

Wait, in aromatic rings, the number of signals depends on the substitution pattern. If the ring is para-substituted, you get two sets of aromatic protons. If it's ortho or meta, maybe more signals. But wait, it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. Depending on their positions, the aromatic protons would split into different signals.

Wait, but the problem says two signals for aromatic-H, so that implies that the ring is symmetric in some way. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, then the aromatic ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. So that fits with two substituents in para positions.

So, the ring is para-substituted with two groups. One of those groups is an ester. What else could the other substituent be? Or maybe one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else.

Wait, but the other signals in NMR include vinyl-H and methyl groups. So, perhaps the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group? Or maybe one substituent is an ester and another is a group that has vinyl and methyl.

Let me think about the possible structure. Let's say one substituent is an ester, like OCOOR, and the other is a vinyl group attached through an oxygen, maybe an ether. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is an alkoxy group connected to another group.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is a methoxy group? Wait, but the NMR shows –CH3 groups. So, maybe the substituents are an ester and a group that has a methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups, but that might complicate things.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for –CH3 groups. That suggests two different methyl groups. So, maybe each substituent has a methyl group, but perhaps they're in different environments. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent has a methyl group, and another group has another methyl.

Wait, but let's think about the other signals. The vinyl-H's are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. So, maybe they're part of a double bond, perhaps an allyl group or something like that.

Let me try to sketch this. Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, where R could be an alkyl group. The other substituent might be an allyl group or a vinyl group attached to something else, perhaps an oxygen.

Wait, but the vinyl protons would be split in a particular way. If the substituent is an -OCH2CH2CO-O- group, maybe. No, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituent is an ester group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is a propyl group with vinyl and methyl groups. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is one of the four options. Let's list the options:

A) C11H14O2
B) C12H14O2
C) C12H12O2
D) C11H12O2

The molecular formula depends on the substituents. Let's think about the substituents. The benzene ring has two substituents, each contributing to the formula.

Each substituent would add to the molecular formula. Let's assume the benzene is C6H6. With two substituents, let's say each substituent is R, so the formula is C6H6 + 2R.

Wait, but in benzene, each substitution replaces a hydrogen. So, for two substituents, we have C6H4 (because 6 - 2 = 4). Then, each substituent adds their own formula.

So, if substituent 1 is OCOOR (ester group), which is O, C, O, R. Let's say R is a methyl group: so substituent 1 is OCOOCH3, which is C3H5O2. Wait, OCOOR would be O, C, O, R. For R = CH3, substituent 1 is O-CO-O-CH3 → which would be (O)2 (from COO) plus CH3. Wait, the formula for OCOOCH3 is: O2, C3 (from COOCH3). So, O2 and C3.

Wait, maybe I should break it down. The benzene ring is C6H6. Each substituent replaces a H, so two substituents replace two H's. So molecular formula would be C6 + (sum of substituent carbons) H(6 - 2) + (sum of substituent hydrogens).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think substituent by substituent.

Let me consider substituent 1 is an ester group, -O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, that's not correct. An ester group is -O-CO-O-R? No, wait, ester is R-O-CO-R', but in
