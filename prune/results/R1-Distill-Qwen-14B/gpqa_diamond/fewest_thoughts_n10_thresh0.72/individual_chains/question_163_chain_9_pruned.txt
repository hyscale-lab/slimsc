Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do this, and also find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, which is a base. To dissolve it, we need an acid. Since it's a monobasic strong acid, I think that means it donates one H+ per molecule and is a strong acid, like HCl. So, the reaction with Fe(OH)3 would be a neutralization reaction.

First, I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the moles. The formula for Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3, so the molar mass is Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)). So that's 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Wait, 0.1 divided by about 100 is 0.001, but since it's 106.85, it's a little less. Let me calculate it exactly: 106.85 is about 107, so 0.1/107 ≈ 0.0009346... So about 0.000935 mol.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid like HCl would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Oh wait, because Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so it needs three H+ ions to neutralize each OH-.

So the stoichiometry tells us that 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl.

So moles of HCl needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. We found 0.000935 mol Fe(OH)3, so HCl needed is 0.002805 mol.

But wait, we need the volume of 0.1 M HCl. Molarity is moles per liter. So volume (L) = moles / Molarity. So 0.002805 mol / 0.1 mol/L
