Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary systems are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2. The problem gives some data about their orbital periods and radial velocities. Alright, I need to think through this step by step.

So, the problem states that both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Right, so the orbital period of the binary system is the same as the eclipse period because the stars have to line up again to cause an eclipse. So system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year.

Then there's radial velocity data. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. Radial velocity amplitude refers to the maximum speed at which the stars are moving towards or away from us. 

Wait, so in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the star with the larger velocity amplitude must be the less massive one. Because if one star is more massive, it doesn't move as much; the less massive one moves more to keep the center of mass balanced.

But how does this tie into the mass of each system? I remember that in a binary system, the two stars orbit each other with a separation determined by their masses. Kepler's third law comes into play here, which relates the orbital period, the separation, and the masses. 

But wait, the mass function in binary systems... Oh right, the mass function relates the observed radial velocities to the masses. The formula is something like (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = ( (K1 * P ) / (2π G) )^3 * (1 - e²)^1.5 ), but I'm a bit hazy on that. Alternatively, since the inclination i is the same for both stars (they orbit in the same plane), and if we assume edge-on (i=90 degrees), sin i is 1. So perhaps we can relate the velocities directly.

Another approach: the masses are proportional to the inverse of their velocities. Because in the center of mass, M1 * v1 = M2 * v2. So M1/M2 = v2/v1. So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. Let me see, M1a / M2a = v2a / v1a = 5/10 = 1/2. So M1a is half of M2a. So the total mass of system_1 is M1a + M2a = (5 +10)/10 = 15/10 = 1.5 times M2a? Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, no. Let me define variables. Let's say in system_1: star A has velocity amplitude K1 = 10 km/s, star B has K2 =5 km/s. The mass ratio q is M_A/M_B. 

From the center of mass condition, M_A * K_A = M_B * K_B. So M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A. So M_A/M_B = 5 /10 = 1/2. So M_A is half of M_B. So the total mass M1 = M_A + M_B = (0.5 M_B) + M_B = 1.5 M_B. So M1 = 1.5 M_B. So M_B = M1 / 1.5. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm getting that right. Alternatively, the mass function for each star is given by the same formula, but perhaps the sum is needed. Alternatively, another approach is to use the fact that the mass ratio can be determined from the velocity ratio.

Wait, I recall that in a binary system, the ratio of the two masses is (v2)/(v1), where v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars. Oh wait, no, wait. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So M1 is more massive than M2 if v1 is smaller than v2. So if M1 is more massive, its velocity is smaller.

So in system_1: M1a / M2a = (v2a)/(v1a) = 5 /10 = 0.5. So M1a is half of M2a. So M2a = 2 M1a. Wait, no, wait: because M1a * v1a = M2a * v2a. So M1a = (M2a * v2a) / v1a.
