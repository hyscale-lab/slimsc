Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. Hmm. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. The reaction should produce acetate ions and water.

The problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I have to calculate both values.

First, I'll start by figuring out the initial concentration after dilution. Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So original volume is 20 cm³, concentration 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, total volume is 40 cm³.

M2 = (M1 * V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 1/40 = 0.0125 M. Wait, let me compute that again. Oh wait, 20 mL +20 mL is 40 mL. So yes, 0.05 *20 = 1 mmol, divided by 40 mL gives 0.025 M? Wait, wait, let me recalculate. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So M1V1 is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, after adding 20 cm³, total volume is 0.04 L. So M2 = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the equivalence point first because that might be easier. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So the moles of NaOH needed for equivalence would be 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

The equivalence point comes when all the acetic acid is neutralized. The reaction produces sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and
