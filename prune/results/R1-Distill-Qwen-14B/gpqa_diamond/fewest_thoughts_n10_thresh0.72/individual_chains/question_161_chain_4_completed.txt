Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this electron microscopy question. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the scenario is about Mike designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV which is pretty intense. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum—like less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible so that the electron microscopy works better because there's less interference from gas particles.

But wait, even in such a high vacuum, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them, so they're present but at a really low pressure. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

So, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature in the compartment stayed the same. So why would the mean free path change?

Let me think about what affects the mean free path. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the mean diameter of the gas molecules, and P is pressure. Wait, but wait, pressure here is in terms of the number density. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as λ = (v_avg) * τ, where v_avg is the average speed and τ is the mean time between collisions.

Another way I remember is that the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure. So when pressure decreases, λ increases. But wait, in this case, the pressure was already very low, and Mike's ultra-high vacuum setup. So some gas is there, but perhaps when the electron beam is turned on, something else happens.

Wait, the electron beam is being used. The electrons are high-energy because of the 1000 kV accelerating voltage. When these electrons interact with the gas molecules, they can cause scattering. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Wait, maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize or to move more. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam affects the mean free path differently.

Wait, but the mean free path here refers to the gas molecules' movement, not the electrons. So in the initial state (without the beam), the gas molecules have a mean free path λ1. When the beam is on, their mean free path changes to λ2.

Hmm. What could cause λ to change? Well, the formula I have is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), but perhaps another factor comes into play when the electron beam is present.

Wait, the electron beam could cause the gas to become ionized. In a high vacuum, if the gas is at such a low pressure, when you start bombarding with high-energy electrons, you might cause the gas molecules to lose electrons (ionization). So, if the gas is ionized, the mean free path would change because the effective diameter of the particles might change. Wait, but wait, ions have a different charge, so they might interact differently.

Wait, but in the initial state, the gas was neutral. When the electron beam hits the gas molecules, maybe it causes them to ionize. Now, the gas molecules become ions with a positive charge. But in a vacuum, once they're ionized, the ions might be accelerated by the electric field from the electron beam or the microscope's own setup.

Wait, but wait, the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding. If the gas particles become charged, would that affect their collisions? Or perhaps, in a vacuum, the ions might not collide as much because they could be accelerated away or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional factors. The beam might cause more collisions, or perhaps the electrons interact with the gas in a way that increases or decreases the effective pressure.

Wait, but the initial pressure is already super low because of the ultra-high vacuum. So if the beam is causing the gas to ionize, perhaps the ions are more mobile or have different cross-sectional areas for collisions.

Wait another thought: when the electron beam is on, it could cause gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, but that's about the electrons. The mean free path here is about the gas molecules' own movement. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up. But the problem states that the sample compartment temperature remained the same, so that's not it. So temperature is constant.

Wait, but the presence of the electron beam could cause other effects. Maybe the beam's electric field affects the motion of the gas ions once they are ionized. So perhaps the ions are accelerated, moving faster, which would increase their average speed, thus increasing the mean free path. But wait, the temperature is the same, so the average kinetic energy (k*T) is the same. So if the gas is ionized, the average speed might change because the mass of the ions is different. Wait, but the gas molecules are probably atoms or small molecules, so the mass change might be negligible. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, when the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path could change due to the change in the way collisions happen. For example, ions might have different cross-sections for collisions. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, let me think about it differently. The mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(√2 * n * d), where n is the number density and d is the collision diameter. So if the number density decreases, λ increases.

But in this scenario, the pressure is already very low, so n is already small. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being removed from the compartment more quickly. Like, if the beam is causing them to be ionized and then pumped out more efficiently. But that would lower the pressure, increasing λ. But the question says that the pressure didn't change because the vacuum remained the same. Wait, no, the scenario says that when the beam is on, the mean free path changes. The pressure in the compartment remains the same because the pumps are still running, so the pressure is still under 1e-9 Torr.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to be scattered. Wait, but that's about the electron scattering from the gas, not the gas's own movement. So perhaps the mean free path of the gas is about their own movement.

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are more likely to be hit by the electrons, which might cause them to move more, but that would increase their speed. But since temperature is constant, higher speed would imply higher kinetic energy, but that's not possible because temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy. Wait, no—wait, if the beam adds energy to the gas, but the temperature remains the same, perhaps the system is at a new equilibrium. But the question says the temperature remains the same, so probably that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to become ionized, and ionized particles have a longer mean free path because they're charged and may not collide as often. Or they might actually collide more because the charge increases their cross-section. Hmm.

Wait, for example, in a plasma, the mean free path might be significantly longer because ions are moving faster and perhaps have different collision rates. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the effective pressure changes because the ions might have a different response to the electric field. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. The mean free path of the gas molecules depends on the pressure and temperature. If the pressure is the same, and temperature is the same, the mean free path shouldn't change. But in this case, Mike observed that it changed. So that suggests that either pressure or effective temperature changed, but the problem states temperature is the same.

Wait, but perhaps the electron beam introduces a small current or charge, which affects the movement of the gas ions. For example, the beam could cause the ions to be repelled or attracted, which could lead to a different effective pressure in the compartment. Alternatively, the ions might get accelerated, effectively reducing the number density in certain regions, thus increasing the mean free path.

Wait, but if the ions are being accelerated, maybe they're moving faster, which would affect their mean free path. But if the temperature is the same, their average speed shouldn't change because temperature is related to average kinetic energy. Hmm, but for ions, perhaps the electric fields could cause bulk movement, which is separate from thermal motion.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become partially ionized, and the charged particles (ions) have a different mean free path because of their charge. For example, in a magnetic field, charged particles might follow a different path, but in this case, it's just an electric field from the electron beam.

Alternatively, maybe the ions are more likely to be pumped out of the system because charged particles might be more easily captured by the pumps. So if the ionized gas is being pumped out more effectively, the pressure would decrease—wait, but in the scenario, Mike found that the mean free path changed, but the pressure was already under 1e-9 Torr. Wait, maybe the beam's presence doesn't change the pressure, but changes the effective mean free path due to the ions' behavior.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what the possible options are. The options are about λ2 in relation to λ1. So, options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1
B) λ2 = λ1, so Mike's observation is wrong
C) λ2 less than λ1
D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So, which is it?

Wait, the mean free path equation is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), right? So if P remains the same, λ depends on T and d. But in this case, T is same, so λ depends on d.

If the gas is ionized, the effective d could change. For example, charged particles might have a larger effective diameter due to their charge, leading to more frequent collisions. Or perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces, reducing the effective number density, thus increasing λ.

Wait, but sticking would change the number density, but the problem says the pressure remains the same. So perhaps the number density is the same. So if the collision diameter d increases, λ decreases. Because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases, λ would decrease.

Wait, but why would d increase? Because the particles are charged. I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps when the gas is ionized, the mean free path increases because the ions have a different interaction. Or maybe the ions have a higher velocity, but that's related to temperature, which is fixed. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the electron beam causes the gas to become a plasma. In a plasma, the mean free path can be longer because the particles are more mobile and perhaps the collisions are less frequent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more transparent, but that's about electrons, not gas molecules.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to be scattered by the beam, which would cause them to move away, thus reducing their effective concentration in the area, but that's more about the electrons scattering the gas, not the gas's own movement.

Wait, but the mean free path is about how far a gas molecule travels before hitting another gas molecule. So if the number of gas molecules decreases (because some are being removed by the beam), then the number density n decreases. Since λ is inversely proportional to n, λ would increase. But in this scenario, the pressure is maintained, which implies that n is the same. So that shouldn't be the case.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam introduces other factors, like the gas molecules being accelerated by the beam, which could lead to a higher average speed. But since the temperature is the same, that's unlikely because thermal speed is already accounted for in the mean free path calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the original calculation. Mike determined λ1 based on the sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So that's the expected mean free path. But when the electron beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2.

What could cause λ2 to be different from λ1?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas particles to be more likely to be scattered by the beam, but that's about electron scattering, not gas molecule movement. So the gas molecules' own mean free path might not be affected.

Wait, but perhaps the electrons are causing gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which changes their effective diameter. For example, if a molecule becomes ionized, it might have a different charge, which could influence the way it collides with other molecules. But I'm not sure whether the diameter would increase or decrease.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized particles have a different effective cross-section for collisions. Maybe the ions are larger in some sense, meaning that d increases. If d increases, then λ = 1/(sqrt(2)*n*d^2) would decrease, because d is in the denominator squared.

So if d increases, λ decreases.

So if λ2 < λ1, that would make option C correct.

Alternatively, if the ions have a smaller effective diameter, λ would increase.

Hmm.

Wait, but when a neutral gas is ionized, does the effective collision diameter change? I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the ion has a smaller diameter because it's just a single atom, but that depends on the gas.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path depends on the type of collisions. For example, ion-ion collisions versus neutral-neutral. But in this case, if the gas is a mix of ions and neutrals, the mean free path could be shorter or longer.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of charged particles creates Coulomb interactions, which could affect the collision rates.

Wait, but I'm getting into more complicated territory here. I think the key point is that when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized. So now, the gas is partially ionized. The mean free path for the gas molecules (which are now ions) could be different from the neutral case.

In a plasma, the mean free path is longer because the particles are moving faster (due to the electric field acceleration) or because collisions are less frequent. Alternatively, perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, another thought: the mean free path of the gas molecules in the presence of the electron beam could be influenced by the electron beam's energy. The high-energy electrons could cause the gas molecules to have more energy, but the temperature is the same, so maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but electron scattering with the gas molecules is a separate process. The gas's mean free path is about their own movement. So perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't directly affect the gas's own movement. That would imply that λ2 should be the same as λ1, but the question says that it's not. So perhaps Mike's observation is incorrect, which is option B.

But wait, the question says that Mike accurately determined λ1 based on factors like pressure, volume, and temperature. So when the electron beam is on, why would λ change?

Hmm, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question states that the temperature remained the same. So that's out.

Wait, another factor: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be more likely to be scattered by the beam, which could cause them to move in different directions, thus effectively increasing the number of collisions. Alternatively, the beam might cause the gas to be more ionized, leading to a decrease in the mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be removed more quickly. If the gas is being pumped out more effectively when the beam is on, then the pressure would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path. But in the scenario, the pressure is maintained because Mike says the mean free path is determined by the same factors, implying the pressure hasn't changed. So that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, but perhaps the beam is causing the gas to be more ionized, which might change the effective pressure. For example, if ionized gas is more easily pumped out, the number density could decrease. If n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. But then why would the pressure remain the same?

Wait, pressure is proportional to n R T / V. If n decreases but pressure remains the same, that would imply that either R T / V changes, which it doesn't under constant conditions, or something else is happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas is being more effectively captured by the pumps. So even though the pressure gauge reads the same (because pressure is maintained), the number density might be lower because the pumps are removing the ions more efficiently. That would mean n is lower, so λ = 1/(n d^2) would be higher. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

But then, why didn't the pressure change? Because the pumps are working to maintain the same pressure. Hmm, but if the ionized gas is being pumped out more, the pumps would have to compensate by pumping less, but the pressure remains the same because the number density is lower. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path isn't just a function of pressure and temperature but also of the type of gas. But the problem states that the same gas is present, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a factor that increases the effective temperature, but the problem says the temperature is same. So that's not it.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the physics differently. The mean free path in a vacuum depends on the number density and the collision cross-section. If the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move faster due to gaining energy from the beam, but since the temperature is same, that's not possible. So perhaps the gas's movement isn't affected, but their cross-section is.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the effective cross-section could change. For example, ions have a different charge, so their collisions could be more or less likely.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a conclusion based on the options and the reasoning.

If the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, and the ions have a larger effective cross-section (d increases), then the mean free path λ would decrease (since λ is inversely proportional to d squared).

So λ2 would be less than λ1. So option C.

Alternatively, if the ions have a smaller effective cross-section, λ would increase. But why would the effective diameter decrease upon ionization? I'm not sure.

Another approach: when the electron beam is on, the gas becomes ionized. The ionized gas might have a higher mean speed because of the energy from the electrons, but since the temperature is same, that's not possible. So perhaps the speed doesn't change, but the way they collide does.

Wait, another thought—could the presence of the beam cause the gas to be in a different state, like a plasma, where the mean free path is longer because the ions are more mobile and interact differently. In a plasma, the mean free path can be larger because of the different interaction dynamics.

If that's the case, then λ2 would be larger than λ1, which would suggest option A or D.

Wait, but I'm not certain about this. I'm a bit torn between options C and A.

Wait, the original mean free path is λ1, determined under vacuum conditions. When the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized. Ions have different properties. For instance, the Coulomb force might cause the ions to interact more or less frequently.

Wait, another formula: in plasmas, the mean free path for ions is often longer because they're more easily accelerated and have higher speeds. But in that case, the mean free path would be longer, so λ2 > λ1. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck because I don't remember the exact behavior of mean free path in ionized gases. Let me think about the possible options again.

If the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, which makes the mean free path longer, then λ2 is larger. So options A or D are possibilities.

If it makes the mean free path shorter, options C or D.

Wait, another angle: when gas is ionized, the ions have a charge, which could cause them to be attracted to the electron beam's electric field. This might cause them to move in a direction, reducing their random movement, which could effectively decrease the number density in certain areas, leading to a longer mean free path. So in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions are more likely to collide with the walls of the compartment, which could cause them to have shorter paths. But if the temperature is same, that might not change the overall mean free path.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a current, which could cause the gas to be more conductive. But how would that affect the mean free path?

Alternatively, maybe the beam causes the gas to become more transparent, but that's about electrons, not gas molecules.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let's think about real-life scenarios. In electron microscopy, when the electron beam is on, the gas in the column can cause electron scattering, which is a problem. So if there's any gas present, the beam current can be scattered, leading to a lower resolution.

So, in that case, the presence of the beam would lead to more scattering, but that's about the electrons. However, if the gas is ionized, perhaps the ions can be more easily removed by the pumps, leading to a lower number density. So n decreases, which would make λ increase.

If n decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the pressure is the same because the pumps are working to maintain it. So even if some ions are being pumped out more efficiently, the pumps would have to work harder to keep the pressure the same. So perhaps the number density (n) is the same, but the cross-section (d) is different.

Wait, if the ions have a larger cross-section, meaning a larger d, then λ would decrease. So λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, if the cross-section is smaller, λ increases.

Hmm. But I'm not sure about whether the cross-section increases or decreases upon ionization.

Wait, another thought: when a gas is ionized, the ions may have a larger effective diameter because they have a charge and perhaps form a larger cloud. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Alternatively, for noble gases like helium, the ion (He+) is smaller than the neutral atom because it's just a single proton and electron. So d would decrease. That would make λ increase because λ is inversely proportional to d squared.

Wait, for example, in neutral helium, the diameter is about 0.3 nm. As He+, the ion diameter would be much smaller, perhaps around 0.1 nm or less. If d decreases, then λ increases.

So if the gas becomes ionized and d decreases, λ would increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So looking back at the options, if λ2 is larger than λ1, which options fit?

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1.

Option D: λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1.

So if λ2 is larger than λ1, then options A or D are possible.

But the question says that the mean free path is no longer λ1. So from λ1, it's now λ2.

If the mean free path increases, then λ2 > λ1.

So possible options are A or D.

Wait, but why would the mean free path be exactly 1.22 times λ1? What's the significance of 1.22?

Wait, 1.22 is approximately sqrt( (2) * (3/π) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 1.22 is approximately 4/π or sqrt(2) * something.

Alternatively, maybe the factor comes from the formula when the collision is considered as a hard sphere model, where the mean free path is λ = 1/(√2 n d). So, the factor would be related to the geometry.

Wait, perhaps the 1.22 factor is from the relation between the mean free path and the transmission through a material. For example, the probability of a particle passing through a thickness L without scattering is exp(-L/λ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the 1.22 factor might be a red herring, but I'm not certain.

Hmm.

If the ionized gas has a smaller effective diameter (d), then λ increases, making λ2 > λ1.

But I'm not sure by how much. The question is whether λ2 is greater than λ1, so options A or D.

Wait, but the question states that the sample compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature are the same. But when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized. So perhaps the effective pressure is lower because some ions are being removed, but the pressure gauge shows the same pressure, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path in the presence of the beam is longer because the ions are moving faster, but since the temperature is same, that can't be.

Wait, another approach: the mean free path for the gas molecules in the presence of the electron beam is affected by the electron scattering. So the gas molecules are being hit by the electrons, which may cause them to scatter more, effectively increasing the collision rate with other gas molecules.

Wait, but that's about the gas molecules being hit by electrons, which is a different process. Their own mean free path is about collisions with other gas molecules.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes more frequent collisions between the gas molecules because the electron momentum transfer increases their kinetic energy, leading to more frequent collisions. But that would imply a shorter mean free path, so λ2 < λ1.

Wait, but the temperature is same, so the average KE shouldn't change. So collisions are determined by the number density and the cross-section.

Hmm.

I think I'm going to have to make a decision here. If the gas becomes ionized, the effective diameter may decrease, making λ longer. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So the mean free path increases.

Looking at the options, that would mean either A or D.

But Mike's observation is that the mean free path is λ2. So if λ2 is greater than λ1, the options are A or D.

But why would it be exactly 1.22 times? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a factor that decreases the mean free path because the electrons cause the gas to be more scattered. So λ2 < λ1.

Wait, maybe the electrons cause the gas to be more ionized, leading to more frequent collisions. So d increases, λ decreases.

So λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But earlier reasoning suggested that ionization might lead to a smaller d, increasing λ, but now I'm going back and forth.

Another angle: the mean free path of the gas molecules is about their own movement. If the electron beam causes the gas to ionize, the ions are influenced by the beam's electric field, which could cause them to move in a direction, reducing their random motion. This would effectively increase the mean free path because the ions are moving in a more directed path, not colliding as often.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas has a lower mean free path because the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces or other parts of the microscope, effectively reducing their presence in the compartment, but that would lower the pressure if not for the pumps.

Since the pressure is maintained, perhaps the number density remains the same but the effective cross-section changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the ions have a larger effective cross-section because of their charge, leading to more collisions, so λ2 < λ1.

If the effective cross-section increases, λ decreases.

So if d increases, λ decreases.

So λ2 < λ1, option C.

In that case, the correct answer would be C.

But I'm not 100% confident, but based on this reasoning, I'll go with option C.


The question revolves around Mike's observation of a change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Initially, the mean free path is determined to be λ₁ under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ₂. The task is to determine the relationship between λ₂ and λ₁.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Mean Free Path Formula**:  
   The mean free path (λ) is given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \pi \cdot d^2 \cdot P}
   \]  
   where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is temperature, \(d\) is the collision diameter, and \(P\) is pressure. Since the temperature (\(T\)) and pressure (\(P\)) remain constant, λ depends on the collision diameter (\(d\)).

2. **Effect of Ionization**:  
   When the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules may become ionized. Ionization can alter the effective collision diameter (\(d\)) due to changes in the molecular interactions. For example:
   - **Smaller Effective Diameter (\(d\))**: If ionization reduces the effective diameter (e.g., due to changes in molecular structure or charge), λ increases because λ is inversely proportional to \(d^2\).  
   - **Larger Effective Diameter (\(d\))**: If ionization increases the effective diameter (e.g., due to charge-induced repulsion or altered cross-section), λ decreases.

3. **Observation of λ₂**:  
   Mike observed that λ₂ is no longer equal to λ₁. This suggests that ionization caused a change in the effective collision diameter (\(d\)). If ionization leads to a larger effective diameter, λ₂ would be smaller than λ₁ (\(λ₂ < λ₁\)).

4. **Elimination of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(λ₂ \geq 1.22 \cdot λ₁\))**: This implies a significant increase in λ₂, which would require a substantial reduction in \(d\). There is no clear evidence in the scenario to suggest such a drastic change.  
   - **Option B (\(λ₂ = λ₁\))**: This would mean no change in the mean free path, contradicting Mike's observation.  
   - **Option D (\(λ₁ < λ₂ < 1.22 \cdot λ₁\))**: This suggests a moderate increase in λ₂, which would require a smaller effective diameter (\(d\)) after ionization. However, the reasoning does not strongly support this specific range.  
   - **Option C (\(λ₂ < λ₁\))**: This aligns with the scenario where ionization increases the effective diameter (\(d\)), leading to a shorter mean free path (\(λ₂ < λ₁\)).

### Conclusion:  
Based on the reasoning, the most plausible conclusion is that ionization increases the effective collision diameter (\(d\)), resulting in a shorter mean free path (\(λ₂ < λ₁\)).

**Answer: C**
