Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what the problem is.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a pion. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh, wait, and the pion is at rest. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum are conserved, but since the pion is at rest, the daughter particles must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, wait, but the neutrino has a mass too, right? Oh, but I think in these problems, the mass of the neutrino is usually neglected because it's very small. So the neutrino's mass is approximately zero. That might simplify things a bit.

So the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. The options are A to D, each giving two values. I think each option represents the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, the neutrino's kinetic energy might be the other number. Let me think.

First, I should probably write down what I know. The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to keep the total momentum zero. So p_mu = -p_nu.

But since the neutrino's mass is zero (or negligible), its energy is just pc, right? Because E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. If m is zero, E = pc. So for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c.

But for the muon, which has a rest mass, its energy would be E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Since p_mu = p_nu (because their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction), let me denote p as the magnitude of each. So p_mu = p, p_nu = p.

So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ), because the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². But I'm a bit confused about units—MeV is energy, so maybe I should treat all terms in energy units.

Wait, let's make this clearer. Let me denote c as 1 for simplicity, so that everything is in units where c=1. So, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + (m_mu)^2 ), and E_nu = p.

The pion is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. So the total energy after decay must also be 139.6 MeV. So E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Substituting E_nu = p and E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ), we get:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6

Hmm, this is an equation in p. Let me write it down:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)²) = 139.6 - p

Squaring both sides:

p² + (105.7)² = (139.6 - p)^2

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p²

So:

p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p + p²

Cancel the p² terms on both sides:

105.7² = 1
