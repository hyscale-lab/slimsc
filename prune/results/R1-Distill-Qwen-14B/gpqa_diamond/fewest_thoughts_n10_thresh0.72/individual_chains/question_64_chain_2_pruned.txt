Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully and figure out what's going on.

So, there's a mixture of salts A and B, and they're equimolar. The total mass is 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200°C without air, meaning probably in an inert atmosphere. When heated, the mixture decomposes into some gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes.

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. Oh wait, no, actually it's used to absorb water. So when a gas passes through it, if there's moisture, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it. The weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that the gas carried some water vapor, which was absorbed by Mg(ClO4)2. So the gas must have had water in it. Or wait, no—wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant, so if the gas had moisture, the tube would gain that mass. If the tube's weight increased by 3.60g, that means 3.60g of water was absorbed. So the initial gas mixture must have included water vapor.

Then, the gas moves to the second tube, which is filled with Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight here didn't change. Hmm, what does that mean? Ca(OH)2 is used to absorb CO2. Because CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. So if the weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2 in the gas mixture. Because if there was CO2, it would have been absorbed, increasing the tube's weight. So the gas after the first tube (which had water) didn't contain CO2. So the gas moving to tube 2 didn't have CO2—so the initial decomposition didn't produce CO2.

Then, the gas goes to the third tube, which has red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g, and CuO was formed. Red-hot copper is used to react with certain gases. I think when CO reacts with hot copper, it forms CO2 and Cu. Wait, no, the reaction is 2Cu + CO2 → 2CuO + C. Wait, no, wait: actually, when CO is passed through a hot Cu, it can be oxidized. Let's think: CO is a reducing agent. So, if the gas has CO, when it passes through Cu (which is probably in a reduced state, maybe Cu2O?), it would react. Alternatively, another reaction: CO could be oxidized by CuO, but if the copper is hot, perhaps it's acting as a catalyst. Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction of CO with copper.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2. Oh wait, when H2 is passed over hot copper, it doesn't react unless in specific conditions. Or maybe the gas is SO2? No, I don't think so. Wait, the third tube's weight increased by 0.80g. So the gas reacting must have contributed that mass. Let's think about possible gases.

Wait, when CO reacts with hot copper, what happens? The reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + C, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, maybe the reaction is:

CO + Cu → CuO + C. No, wait, I'm a bit shaky on this. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is H2S. But I don't think so because earlier, the first tube absorbed water. Let's think again.

Wait, the third tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams. So the gas that passed through must have reacted to add mass. For example, if the gas was H2O, but Mg(ClO4)2 already absorbed all the moisture. So perhaps the gas was CO. Because when CO reacts with hot Cu, it can form CuO and carbon. Let's write the reaction:

Cu (hot) + CO → CuO + C.

The molar mass of CO is 28 g/mol. For each mole of CO, it would produce one mole of CuO. The increase in mass would be the mass of O from CO. Because when CO (28 g/mol) is converted to CuO (80 g/mol), but wait, maybe the mass change is the addition of O. So each mole of CO would add 16 g of O (since CO has one O atom), leading to an increase. Let's check:

Each mole of CO contributes 1 mole of O (16 g). So if the mass gained is 0.80g, then moles of O = 0.80 /16 = 0.05 moles. So moles of CO would be 0.05, since each CO gives one O. So 0.05 moles of CO.

Wait, but the mass gained is 0.80g, so moles would be 0.80 / (mass change per mole of CO). Let's think again.

The reaction is: 2 CO + Cu → CuO + C.

But that might not be right. Alternatively, another reaction: CO + Cu → CuO + C. Let's see the mass change here.

Each CO molecule has a molar mass of 28 g/mol. When it reacts with Cu, it produces CuO (80 g/mol) and C (12 g/mol). Wait, but that doesn't make sense in terms of mass, because the products have higher mass. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

CO + 2 Cu → CuO + Cu + C.

But I'm not
