Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, a chemist found an unnamed bottle with a white solid. He ran some spectral analyses, and I need to use that info to identify the compound from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures. 

Let me list out the data provided:

Mass Spectrometry: 
- Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)
- A peak at m/z = 158 (32%)

IR:
- Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1
- Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1

1H NMR:
- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H)
- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H)
- 7.72 (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156. The fragment at 158 is a doublet, which is interesting because 158 is higher than the molecular ion. Wait, that's a bit unusual. Usually, fragment peaks are lower than the molecular ion. But sometimes, if there's a possible addition, like maybe Cl or something else. Let me think about the options.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Let me look at their molecular formulas.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH groups. Formula would be C7H5ClO2.

Molecular weight calculation: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total =84+5+35.5+32=156.5. Hmm, but mass spec says m/z 156. That's close enough, maybe considering isotopic peaks or rounding.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzoic acid with Cl at the para position. Formula is C7H5ClO2.

Same molecular formula as A. Molecular weight is same 12*7=84, H5=5, Cl35.5, O2=32. So 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So same as A, but in B, the functional group is COOH instead of aldehyde and OH.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2Cl. Wait, phenyl is C6H5, chloroformate is ClCOO-. So total is C7H5ClO2. Same as before. Molecular weight same.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So benzoic acid with Cl in the ortho position. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same molecular weight.

So all options except maybe C have the same formula as A, B, D. Wait, but wait the molecular weight is 156.5 for all except perhaps C? Let me recalculate for C.

Phenyl chloroformate: C6H5-O-CO-Cl? Wait, no. Phenyl chloroformate is ClCO-O-C6H5. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Same as others. So molecular weight is same. So all options A, B, C, D have the same molecular weight of 156.5. So that explains why the molecular ion is at 156.

But wait, the mass spec has a fragment at 158 (32
