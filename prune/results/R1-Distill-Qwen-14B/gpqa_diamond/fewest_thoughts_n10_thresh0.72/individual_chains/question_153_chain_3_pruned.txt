Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Michael additions, which I remember involve the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The Michael donor is the nucleophile, and the Michael acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. 

So the problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each with different reactants and reagents. I need to determine the products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Let's start with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a dienolate. I think when the dienolate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, the base would deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be the Michael acceptor here.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably something like CH2=CH-p-tolyl-OCH3, but wait, no. Correction: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH3. Oh, but wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl or something else. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1
