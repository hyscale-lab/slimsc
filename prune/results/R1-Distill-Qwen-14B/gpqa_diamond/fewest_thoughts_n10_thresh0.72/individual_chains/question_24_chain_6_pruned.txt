Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to break it down step by step.

So the problem says we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually means the mixture has something that can undergo an addition reaction with bromine, like alkenes or alkynes. So maybe mixture X has two unsaturated compounds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction resulting in an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids due to disproportionation. Disproportionation is when one element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps one of the starting materials is an alkyne, which upon hydrogenation could split into different products. Or maybe it's about alkenes, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So whatever Y is, it doesn't have any double or triple bonds. So maybe Y's components are fully saturated, like alkanes or something else without unsaturation.

Then, both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, give the same hydrocarbon Z. Oh, and Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate that. 14.28% is roughly 1/7, because 1/7 is approximately 14.2857%. So the hydrogen mass is 1/7 of Z's molar mass.

Hydrocarbon Z is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Common solvents include things like toluene, acetone (but that's a ketone), maybe something like hexane or octane, but wait, widely used solvents—like maybe toluene or xylene? Or maybe something else. Wait, but Z is a hydrocarbon, so it must be a saturated molecule, since it doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be an alkane, or maybe something else without reactive H's.

Wait, but let's think about the percentages. If Z has 14.28% hydrogen by mass, let's find out its molecular formula.

Assume Z is CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) * 100 = 14.28%.

So, (m / (12n +m )) = 0.1428 ≈ 1/7.

Multiply both sides by (12n +m), get m = (12n +m)/7.

Multiply both sides by 7: 7m = 12n +m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So m is twice the number of carbon atoms. So the formula would be CnH2n. Wait, that's the formula for alkenes, but Z is a hydrocarbon obtained by hydrogenation, so maybe it's an alkane? Or wait, if X and Y upon hydrogenation give Z, perhaps Z is a saturated compound.

Wait, but wait—if Z is CnH2n, it's an alkene, but it's not reacting further with hydrogen. Hmm, but alkenes typically do react with
