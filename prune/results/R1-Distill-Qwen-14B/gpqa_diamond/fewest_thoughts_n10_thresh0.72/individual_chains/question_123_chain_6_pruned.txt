Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center, I think.

The problem asks: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, but wait. I remember that time can dilate in different frames if they're moving relative to each other. So I need to consider the time experienced in each frame and how they relate.

So, first, let's get the basics straight. In the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. So in this frame, the time elapsed is t. But the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's (moving) frame, which is the proper time, I think. So we need to relate the two times using the Lorentz factor.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 60,000 km/s, I need to calculate that. Wait, what's 60,0
