Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? It's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So the first step is treating it with bromine. Hmm, bromine in what conditions? I think when ketones react with bromine, it's usually an addition reaction, like the haloform reaction? Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, which can undergo some kind of addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via enol formation? Or maybe it's a diels-alder type reaction? Wait, no, diels-alder is diene + dienophile, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, when ketones react with bromine (Br2), I think it's more about the enolate. Oh wait, wait. Oh, I think the reaction of ketones with bromine under certain conditions could lead to the formation of a dibromide via the enol mechanism. Like, the enol attacks Br2. So cyclohexanone would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or maybe in some other position.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a bromination on the ring. No, cyclohexanone is a ketone, so the ring is already substituted with a carbonyl group, and bromine adding to the ring would require some activation. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation. Wait, no, that's when you have H2O and Br2, like in the addition to alkenes.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the bromine is acting as an oxidizing agent. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition to the carbonyl group. Wait, ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. So Br2 would probably add across the carbonyl group. Let me think: cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add Br2, maybe it adds across the carbonyl, making a geminal dibromide. So the product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or more accurately, 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, right next to the carbonyl.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the carbonyl is in a cyclohexanone, so the structure is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So the carbonyl is at one position, and the adjacent carbons
