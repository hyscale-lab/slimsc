Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are different inverse power laws, so it's about understanding how the number relates to parallax.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I think that means the number density is the same in all directions. But how does that translate to the number as a function of parallax?

Let me think about the volume. For a given volume, the number of stars would be proportional to the volume. But when you consider parallax, you're looking at shells of a certain thickness in parallax space. But wait, parallax is in inverse parsecs, so maybe I should think in terms of distance. 

Wait, another approach: The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. How does that depend on plx?

Alternatively, the number of stars per unit volume in space is uniform, so N = n * V, where n is number density and V is volume. But what's V in terms of parallax?

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So if I have a thin shell between d and d + dd, the volume is approximately 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in this shell would be n * 4π d² dd.

But since plx is 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx². And dd is the change in d, which corresponds to a change in plx. Let me compute how dd relates to dplx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = -1/(plx²) dplx. Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases, so the negative just tells direction, but for volume, I think I can ignore the sign. So dd ≈ (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting into the volume, V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but wait, the number of stars in this shell is n * V. So N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit dplx is N/(dplx) = 4π n / plx^4. So the number density per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4. That would correspond to option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another way: Let's think about the volume between two spheres of radius d and d+dd. The volume is 4π d² dd. Now, since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So substituting d in terms of plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 (dd). But what's dd in terms of dplx? Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So dd = - (d^2) dplx. Because differentiating plx = 1/d gives dplx = -1/d² dd → dd = -d² dplx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 ( (1/plx^2) dplx ), since d squared is (1/plx)^2. So 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx is n * Volume, which is n * 4π/(plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx (dplx) is (n *4π)/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

Wait, but wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So it's the number per unit plx. So it's 1/plx^4, which would be option A.

Alternatively, some people might get confused between number per unit distance and number per unit parallax. Let me think again. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number per unit volume is constant. So the number in a shell depends on the volume, which increases with d squared, but since d is inversely proportional to
