Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about high-energy gamma rays annihilating with CMB photons. I remember that the CMB is the afterglow of the Big Bang, and it's everywhere, so the photons are all around us. The question is about the energy at which gamma-ray photons' lifetimes are limited by this annihilation process. Hmm.

The reaction given is gamma gamma -> e+ e-. So high-energy gamma-rays are interacting with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. I think this has to do with photon-photon interactions, which I remember are not common because photons don't usually interact much, but at high energies, they can.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's 0.001 eV. So each CMB photon has that energy on average. I think the CMB is a blackbody spectrum peaking around microwave frequencies, so the typical photon energy is about that.

The problem is asking for the gamma-ray energy where its lifetime is limited by this process. So, when the annihilation process becomes significant, the gamma-ray can't live as long as it would otherwise. The lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction rate, I think. So higher interaction rates mean shorter lifetimes.

I remember that for photon-photon interactions, the cross-section increases with the energy of the photons involved. The cross-section for gamma gamma -> e+ e- is a function of the center of mass energy. The threshold energy for this reaction is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the electron-positron pair.

The threshold condition is when the center of mass energy (sqrt(s)) equals twice the electron rest mass energy. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so twice that is about 1.022 MeV. So each photon needs to have enough energy such that when they collide, their combined energy is at least 1.022 MeV.

But wait, in this case, the gamma-ray photon is much higher energy than the CMB photon. Let me denote the gamma-ray energy as E_gamma and the CMB photon as E_cmb. Since the CMB photons are all around, the gamma-ray will collide with them.

The center of mass energy squared (s) is given by (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (p_gamma c + p_cmb c)^2, where p is momentum. But for photons, E = pc, so this simplifies. Let me think: for two photons moving in opposite directions, their energies add in the center of mass frame. So s = (E_gamma + E_cmb)^2 - (E_gamma - E_cmb)^2. Wait, no, wait. If they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so in the lab frame, if the gamma is moving in the +x direction and the CMB photon is moving in the -x direction, then p_gamma is +E_gamma/(c), and p_cmb is -E_cmb/(c). So the total energy is E_gamma + E_cmb, and the total momentum is (E_gamma - E_cmb)/(c). So the invariant s is (E_total c
