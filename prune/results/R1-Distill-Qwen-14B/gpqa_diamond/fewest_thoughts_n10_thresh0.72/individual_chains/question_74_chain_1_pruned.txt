Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and the probability of decay doesn't depend on the age of the atom. Oh wait, right, each atom has a constant probability of decaying per unit time, regardless of how old it is. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the future. But wait, is that the case here?

Wait, the given probability is 32% for 100 minutes. So maybe that's the decay constant or something. No, wait, the decay constant λ relates to the probability per unit time, right? So the decay probability P(t) is usually given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where t is the time. Or wait, another way to model it is using the half-life, but perhaps in this question, they're giving us a specific time and probability.

Wait, the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, using that, we can find the decay
