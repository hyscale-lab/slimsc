Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see... The question is about the probability of a single atom decaying after some time has passed. Hmm.

Alright, the setup is that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. But 50 minutes have already passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, they're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D, but I need to figure out the right approach.

Wait, so first, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The decay probability isn't linear; it's based on the time that has passed. Oh right, the formula for the probability of decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But wait, actually, in this problem, they're talking about the probability of decay, not the remaining quantity.

Wait, no. Let me think. The probability that the atom has decayed by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So the probability it hasn't decayed is e^(-λt). So the way the question is phrased, the decay probability within t is given as 32% for 100 minutes.

So the given data: P(100) = 32% = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100).

Wait, let me solve for λ. Let me rearrange this equation. So, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/(100).

Calculating ln(0.68): Let's see, ln(1) is 0, ln(e^-0.4) is about -0.4, since e^-0.4 is around 0.67. Oh wait, 0.67 is close to 0.68, so ln(0.68) is approximately -0.4. Let me get a more accurate value. Hmm, using a calculator, ln(0.68) is
