Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

First, the question provides FTIR and 1H NMR data. Let's look at the IR first. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness is because the O-H can hydrogen bond, right? So a broad peak here suggests the compound has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1, which is typical for a carbonyl group, which is present in carboxylic acids as well. So that fits together.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several peaks, but none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests there are no double bonds, which fits with the IR data because a carboxylic acid wouldn't have a double bond unless maybe it's an ester or something else, but the IR peak at 1700 is more likely a carboxylic acid carbonyl. So no alkene here.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting patterns. 

The splitting in NMR comes from neighboring (adjacent) hydrogens. So if a proton has n neighboring non-equivalent protons, it will split into n+1 peaks. But when the neighboring groups are further away, like on adjacent carbons, it can lead to more complex splitting patterns, like doublets of doublets, etc.

Let me think about the structure. The compounds given are all substituted pentanoic acids, I think. Wait, no, looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-C(C2H5)-C(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Wait, maybe it's more like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, that's more like 3-pentyl groups on adjacent carbons.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So maybe that's CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the chain is longer, with ethyl groups on adjacent carbons.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So like CH2CH3 attached to a C, which is attached to another C which has a C2H5 group. Wait, the structure would
