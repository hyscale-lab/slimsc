Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to visualize each reaction.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is an allyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond at position 1. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is probably CH2=C-CH2-, but wait, more accurately, I think it's CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Wait no, prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as allyl group. So, the substituent at position 5 is an allyl group, so the structure is cyclohexanone with substituents at 3 (–CH2OH) and 5 (–CH2CHCH2? Or maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2CH3 where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, structure would be CH2=CH-CH2– attached to the ring. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. So, the substituent would be CH2-CH2-CH2- where the middle is double bonded. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2, but the numbering is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Maybe it's better to think of it as CH2=CH-CH2–, but attached from the middle carbon. Oh, wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So, the structure is CH2=C(CH2–)-. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2– attached via the middle carbon. So, the group is CH2– attached to the ring, then a double bond, then CH3. So, it's an allyl group attached to the cyclohexane ring.

So, structure is cyclohexanone with hydroxymethyl at C3 and allyl at C5.

Now, the first reaction: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming
