Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Let's take it step by step. 

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, I should probably draw this structure out. So, cyclohexanone ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2CH2 group but I think more accurately, it's CH2–C(CH2)–? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent would be the part from the double bond. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH2–CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2–C(CH3). Let me think. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–C(CH2)– but wait, more accurately, it's CH2–CH(CH2–) but wait, no. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH–CH2– but as a substituent, it's the part attached to the main molecule. So substituent would be CH2– attached to the cyclohexane, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, maybe it's -CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's more like the substituent is a vinyl group but attached at the middle carbon. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2–C(CH3)=CH2? No, maybe it's CH2–CH(CH2–). Wait, perhaps I should look it up. Alternatively, I can think of it as a substituent where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is attached at carbon 2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH2–CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Wait, maybe it
