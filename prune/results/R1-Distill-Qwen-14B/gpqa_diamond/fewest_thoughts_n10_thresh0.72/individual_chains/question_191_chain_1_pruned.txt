Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Then it's treated through a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the structure of the final product, product 4.

Let me break down each step.

First step: Treating with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So, I think this is an alkylation reaction. The starting compound has a hydroxymethyl group (OCH2OH?), wait no, wait. Wait, 3-(hydroxymethyl) would be a CH2OH group attached to the cyclohexanone ring at position 3. So, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group at position 1. At position 3, there's a CH2OH group, and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a vinyl group attached at the middle carbon. So, it's CH2=C(CH3)-, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2CH2CH3 with a double bond between 1 and 2? Wait, no, wait: prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2-) something? No, wait. Let me think. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2=C(CH2â€“). Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The prop-1-en-2-yl group would be the substituent where the double bond starts at carbon 1. So, it's CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's CH2=C-CH2-. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is
