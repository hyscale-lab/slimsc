Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what's going on.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So the main ring is cyclohexanone (since it's a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, what's that? Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)- something? Oh wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent would be the group attached to the cyclohexane. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH3)-, attached via the number 2 carbon. So it's an isopropenyl group, right? So the substituent is an allyl group, like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH2CH2? No, wait, the structure is CH2=C(CH2R)-, wait maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-C(=CH2)- attached via the middle carbon. So it's an allyl group, like CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the middle carbon. So it's actually an isopropenyl group: CH2=C(CH3)-, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Alternatively, let me think: the group is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, wait, wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the central carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH
