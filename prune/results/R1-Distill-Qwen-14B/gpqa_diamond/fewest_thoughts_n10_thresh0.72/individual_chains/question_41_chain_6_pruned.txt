Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c / n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So, when the medium isn't moving, the speed is simply c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so I guess I need to consider the relative motion.

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, moving in the same direction as the beam. So the light is moving through the glass which is itself moving.

I'm a bit confused about whether I should apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Because if the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of the light.

Wait, velocities in relativity don't just add up normally. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the frame moving relative to the original. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving, so the frame is the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light's velocity in the glass's frame would be c/n, right? Because in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer.

But then, to find the speed in the lab frame (where the glass is moving at v), we need to transform the velocity. So u is the velocity of the light in the glass frame, which is c/n towards the observer. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, so the lab frame sees it.

Wait, so the light's velocity in the glass frame is u = c/n
