Okay, so I have this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that the mass dimension of coupling constants is important in determining whether a theory is renormalizable. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, those are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices, so σ_{μν} is antisymmetric in μ and ν.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Mass dimension is determined by ensuring that the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless. The Lagrangian density has dimensions of [Mass]^4 since the integral over four dimensions gives an action that's dimensionless.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Let me break down each part of the term.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ is 3/2. Because each ψ and ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ⁰) has dimension (3/2).

Then, σ_{μν} is made from [γ matrices], which are dimensionless. Because gamma matrices are treated as constants, their commutators are also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has no mass dimension.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or another gauge field. The field strength F has mass dimension 2. Because for a gauge field A, F_{μν} = ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ + [A, A], and each derivative ∂ has dimension 1. So F is dimension 1 (from derivatives) + dimension 0 (since A is dimension 1; because the kinetic term is (∂A)^2 which must have dimension 4, so (∂A) has dimension 2, so A has dimension 1). Wait, maybe I should recheck that. Wait, the gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because the kinetic term is like (∂A)^2, and each ∂ has dimension 1, so (∂A) has dimension 1 + 1 = 2, so (∂A)^2 has dimension 4, which is correct for a Lagrangian term. So F_{μν}, which is made from derivatives of A, also has dimension 2.

Putting it all together:

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

So let me compute the mass dimension:

Each ψ̄ and ψ contribute (3/2) each. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. But wait, σ is dimensionless, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3.

Then F has dimension 2. So the term becomes [κ] + (3) + (2) = 4
