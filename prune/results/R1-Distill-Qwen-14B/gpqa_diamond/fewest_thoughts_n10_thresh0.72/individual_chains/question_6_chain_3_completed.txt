Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential, and I need to find the energy spectrum. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that potentials in polar coordinates can sometimes be separated into radial and angular parts, which might help in solving the Schrödinger equation.

Wait, so the potential has two terms: one that's just proportional to r squared, and another that depends on cos squared theta. The first term, (1/2)kr², looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in radial direction. But the second term, (3/2)kr² cos²θ, is a bit trickier. Cos squared theta usually relates to angular parts, like maybe the polar angle in spherical coordinates. Oh wait, but this is two-dimensional, so maybe it's cylindrical coordinates? Because in 2D polar coordinates, r is the radial distance and θ is the angle.

So, maybe I should express this potential in terms of r and theta to see if it's separable. Let's see: V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I can factor out kr², getting V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Wait, wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the first term is (1/2) kr² and the second is (3/2) kr² cos²θ, so it's kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

But wait, that doesn't look separable because the angular part is cos²θ. Alternatively, maybe I can rewrite cos²θ in terms of double angles to make it something that can be expressed with a separation of variables.

I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Wait, let's compute that step by step. The second term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ, which becomes (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. So multiplying that, (3/2)*(1/2) is 3/4, so that becomes (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). So the entire potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ).

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. The second term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. So cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So the term becomes (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). So the entire potential is (1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ). Let me add those terms together.

So combining the terms, (1/2) kr² plus (3/4) kr² is (1/2 + 3/4) kr², which is 5/4 kr². And then the other term is (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm. So this looks like V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So perhaps it's easier to write this as kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Alternatively, maybe I can write the potential as a sum of terms that depend on r and theta separately. Wait, but since it's multiplied by r squared, I'm not sure if that's separable. Wait, perhaps the potential can be written as V(r) + V(θ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: in two dimensions, the potential can sometimes be expressed in terms of effective potentials. Or maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes it's easier to separate variables in Cartesian than polar coordinates.

Wait, let's think about the potential in Cartesian coordinates. Let x = r cosθ and y = r sinθ. Then cosθ = x/r, so cos²θ = x²/(r²). So the potential is (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² (x²/r²) )= (1/2) kr² + (3/2) k x².

Wait, so V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) k x². Because (x²) is r² cos²θ, so when multiplied by kr², it becomes (3/2 k x²). So the potential becomes (1/2) kr² + (3/2) k x². Hmm, that looks like a sum of two harmonic oscillator potentials.

Wait, that's interesting. So the potential is the sum of two terms: (1/2)k r² and (3/2)k x². Let me check:

Wait, let me compute (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Since x = r cosθ, then x² = r² cos²θ. So (3/2)k x² = (3/2)k r² cos²θ. So that's correct. So the potential can be written as V(x, y) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x². Because r² is x² + y². So substituting, (1/2)k(x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2) k y². Because:

(1/2)k(x² + y²) is (1/2 k x²)+(1/2 k y²). Then adding (3/2 k x²) gives (1/2 + 3/2) k x², which is 2k x², and 1/2 k y². So overall, V(x, y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x².

= (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²)
= (1/2 + 3/2) k x² + (1/2)k y²
= 2 k x² + (1/2 k) y².

Yes, that's correct. So the potential is 2k x² in x and (1/2)k y² in y. Oh wait, no, because that's not a function of just r and theta anymore, but in Cartesian coordinates.

So in Cartesian coordinates, the potential is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2) k y².

Wait, but that's a quadratic potential in x and y. So this looks like two independent harmonic oscillators, but with different frequencies. Because the potential in x is 2k x², and in y it's (1/2)k y².

Wait, but harmonic oscillators in x and y would imply that the particle is in a 2D harmonic oscillator potential, but with different coefficients in x and y directions.

So in this case, the potential is separable in x and y. So the Schrödinger equation can be written in terms of x and y variables, each with their own harmonic oscillator potentials.

So the Hamiltonian would be H = (p_x²)/(2m) + (p_y²)/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Wait, no, 2k x² is the potential energy. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = [p²/(2m)] + [2k x² + (1/2)k y²].

Wait, no, wait. [p²/(2m)] is the kinetic energy, and the potential is 2k x² plus 0.5 k y².

So the Hamiltonian can be written as H = (p_x^2 + p_y^2)/(2m) + 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

But since the potential depends only on x and y separately, the Hamiltonian is separable. So the total energy would be the sum of the energies from each direction.

Each direction can be treated as a 1D harmonic oscillator, but with their own spring constants.

In 1D, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator are E_n = (n + 1/2) ℏω, where ω = sqrt(k/m).

So for the x-direction, the potential is 2k x², which can be written as (1/2) m ω_x² x², where ω_x² = (2k)/m → ω_x = sqrt(2k/m).

Similarly, for y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y² → ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So each direction contributes to the total energy.

The total energy would be E = E_x + E_y. Where E_x is the energy for the x-direction oscillator and E_y is for the y-direction.

So E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(2k/m).

E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ ω_y = (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy E = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(2k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Hmm, but the options given don't seem to match this form. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) E = (2n_x +3n_y +1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

B) E = (n_x +3n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

C) E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

D) E = (3n_x +2n_y +1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m))

Wait, but in my calculation, the energies have different frequencies for x and y. So unless the problem is isotropic, but in this case, it's not. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The potential in Cartesian coordinates is 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So x and y are treated differently. Thus, the energy levels would involve each direction's quantum numbers and their respective frequencies.

But the options don't have any square roots of 2 or 1/2. They all have sqrt(k/m), implying that the frequencies are the same. So maybe I made a mistake in the way I separated the potential.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have treated the potential in polar coordinates and found a way to separate the equation. Because the potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ can be written as V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ].

Alternatively, cos²θ can be expressed as (1 + cos2θ)/2, so V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) * (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

Wait, let me compute that expansion:

(3/2) * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4)(1 + cos2θ).

So V(r,θ) = kr² [ 1/2 + 3/4 (1 + cos2θ) ]

= kr² [ (1/2 + 3/4) + (3/4) cos2θ ]

= kr² [ (5/4) + (3/4) cos2θ ]

Hmm. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

But how does this help? Because the potential depends on r and 2θ. So perhaps the angular part is cos2θ, which suggests that the angular wavefunction must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the potential as V(r,θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3 kr² /4) cos(2θ).

But then, in the Schrödinger equation for 2D polar coordinates, the equation is:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r) (d/dr (r dr ψ/dr)) + (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (d²ψ/dθ²) ) ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

But with the potential having a cos2θ term, the angular part may not be separable in the usual way. Unless the angular part is a function of 2θ.

Wait, but perhaps the angular part can be expressed as e^{i n θ}, which when taking derivatives gives terms involving n.

But because the potential has a cos2θ term, perhaps the solution for ψ(θ) must be in terms of functions that have even multiples of θ, such as e^{i 2m θ} for integer m.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach: Let me think about the potential again. The potential depends on r² and cos2θ, which suggests that the angular part of the potential is symmetric under rotations of 180 degrees, but not under 90 degrees. So perhaps the energy levels are determined by a combination of the quantum numbers n_r (radial) and L (angular momentum), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of a shifted angular coordinate. For example, the cos2θ term might suggest that the angular dependence is in multiples of 2θ, which could relate to a specific angular momentum quantum number. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the potential can be re-expressed in terms of a sum of terms that are functions of r and functions of θ, allowing the separation of the Schrödinger equation.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the problem differently. The potential in Cartesian coordinates is V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So this looks like a 2D harmonic oscillator, but with different frequencies in x and y.

Wait, but in that case, the energy levels would be the sum of the individual oscillator energies. Let me restate that.

In the x-direction, the potential is 2k x². The standard harmonic oscillator has potential (1/2) m ω² x². So comparing, we have (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k → ω_x² = (4k)/(m) → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, for the y-direction, the potential is (1/2)k y². So (1/2)m ω_y² = (1/2)k → ω_y²= k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the energy levels for the x-direction are E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ ω_x = (n_x + 1/2) ℏ (2 sqrt(k/m)) ) = (2n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, because 2 sqrt(k/m) is the same as 2 times sqrt(k/m), which is 2 * sqrt(k/m). So E_x = (n_x + 1/2) * 2 * ℏ sqrt(k/m) ) = (2n_x +1) * (ℏ sqrt(k/m)).

Similarly, in the y-direction, E_y = (n_y +1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

So the total energy would be E = E_x + E_y = (2n_x +1) ℏ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y +1/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m).

Combine terms: [ (2n_x +1) + (n_y +1/2) ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m )

= [ 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 ] * ℏ sqrt(k/m )

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is E = (2n_x +n_y +3/2)ℏ sqrt(k/m). So that's matching.

Wait, but wait, the problem didn't specify the coordinates, and I switched to Cartesian. But is that valid?

Wait, because in the original problem, the potential was expressed in polar coordinates as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. When I converted to Cartesian, I found that V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y². So that's correct.

So, in that case, each direction has a different frequency. Therefore, the energy is the sum of the energies from each direction, each of which is quantized as in the harmonic oscillator.

So the total energy would indeed be E = [2n_x + n_y + 3/2] ℏ sqrt(k/m), which is option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential is expressed in polar coordinates, but it is convenient to rewrite it in Cartesian coordinates. Using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \), the potential becomes:
   \[
   V(x, y) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}k x^2.
   \]
   Substituting \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential simplifies to:
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2k x^2 + \frac{1}{2}k y^2.
   \]
   This represents two independent harmonic oscillators in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, with different spring constants.

2. **Energy Levels in Each Direction**:  
   For a 1D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_n = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \omega,
   \]
   where \( \omega = \sqrt{k/m} \).  
   - In the \( x \)-direction, the potential is \( 2k x^2 \), corresponding to \( \omega_x = \sqrt{2k/m} \). The energy levels are:
     \[
     E_x = \left(2n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]
   - In the \( y \)-direction, the potential is \( \frac{1}{2}k y^2 \), corresponding to \( \omega_y = \sqrt{k/m} \). The energy levels are:
     \[
     E_y = \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
     \]

3. **Total Energy**:  
   The total energy is the sum of the contributions from the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions:
   \[
   E = E_x + E_y = \left(2n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
   Combining terms:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived energy expression with the given options, the correct match is:
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]
   This corresponds to **Option C**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
