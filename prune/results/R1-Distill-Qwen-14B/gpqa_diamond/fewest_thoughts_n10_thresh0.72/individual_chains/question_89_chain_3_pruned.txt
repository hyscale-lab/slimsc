Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see... It's about some reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons?

The first part says it's heated with excess KOH to give a light yellow solid product 1. Looking at the NMR data: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). And an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Oh, wait, the IR peak is around 1720, which is typical for a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone.

So, the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. That sounds like an elimination reaction, perhaps dehydrohalogenation. But since it's dibromide, maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, since KOH is a strong base, it might promote an E2 mechanism, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. But wait, the product has a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement or oxidation?

Wait, another thought: when dibromides are treated with a strong base like KOH, sometimes they undergo elimination to form alkenes. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl. Oh, maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination? Or perhaps it's a trans-esterification or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, but let me think about the structure. 1,3-Dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent positions. Heating with KOH could lead to an elimination, forming a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl, so maybe the product is a ketone or an ester.

Wait, another approach: when a dihalide reacts with a base, like KOH, and especially in a situation where two adjacent X atoms are present, it's likely to form an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But in this case, the product has a carbonyl, so perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, leading to a carbonyl group. Oh
