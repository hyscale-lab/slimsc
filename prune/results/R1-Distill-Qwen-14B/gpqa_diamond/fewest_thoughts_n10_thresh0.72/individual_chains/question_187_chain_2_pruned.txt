Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics, so I'll have to think this through.

The question gives me six options for stars, labeled a) through f), and I need to determine how many of them would be detectable. The criteria are that the S/N per binned pixel should be at least 10 after a 1-hour exposure. 

First, I should probably figure out what factors determine the S/N for a star observed by ESPRESSO. From what I recall, S/N depends on the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the background noise. Oh right, the formula for signal-to-noise ratio is something like S/N = (N_photons) / sqrt(N_photons + N_noise). But maybe for this problem, I can think in simpler terms.

Wait, I think in practice, S/N is proportional to the square root of the exposure time, the flux from the object, and inversely proportional to the square root of the wavelength range or the number of pixels or something like that. Hmm, but maybe I can use the concept that brighter stars (lower magnitude) will have higher S/N because they emit more photons.

The absolute magnitude system is tricky. Remember that lower magnitudes mean brighter stars. So a star with V magnitude 0 is brighter than a magnitude 5. Wait, no, waitâ€”wait, no, that's the apparent magnitude. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude a star would have at 10 parsecs distance. So a star with absolute magnitude 15 is fainter than one with, say, 5.

Wait, but the given stars in options c, d, e, f all have the same absolute magnitude of 15. So their intrinsic brightness is the same. But their distances vary, which affects their apparent magnitude.

Wait, right. The apparent magnitude (m) is related to absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d in parsecs) by the formula m = M + 5 log10(d / 10). So the farther away the star is, the higher its apparent magnitude (since it's fainter).

So for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude based on their distance. The brighter the star (lower m), the more photons it emits, the higher the S/N.

But how does that translate into whether ESPRESSO can detect them? I think I need to know the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO. Wait, what's the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve for a certain exposure time?

Wait, I might have to look up some typical S/N levels for ESPRESSO. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed for very high-resolution spectroscopy, but for S/N, I think it's optimized for bright stars, but can it go deeper?

Wait, I'm not sure, so perhaps I should think about the exposure time and how it affects S/N. For a given star, the S
