Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal but all angles are the same. So, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the distance between adjacent atoms along the edges of the unit cell. So the lattice parameter 'a' would be 10 Angstrom here because in a rhombohedral structure, all edges are the same length.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula I remember for interplanar distance d is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... ), but wait, that depends on the crystal system. Oh right, for cubic systems, the formula is d = a/(sqrt(h² +k² + l²)), but rhombohedral is not cubic, so I think it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, in a general crystal system, especially non-cubic ones, the interplanar distance formula involves the Miller indices and the lattice parameters as well as the angles between the lattice vectors. I think the formula for a rhombohedral structure is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, is that right? Because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees here. So substituting, the denominator becomes sqrt(h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos(30) - 2hl cos(30) - 2kl cos(30)).

Since the plane is (111), the Miller indices are h=1, k=1, l=1. So plugging those in:

Denominator = sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*1*1
