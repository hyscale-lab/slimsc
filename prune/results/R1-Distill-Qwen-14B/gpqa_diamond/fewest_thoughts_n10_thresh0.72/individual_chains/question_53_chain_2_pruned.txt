Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's something like benzene with two substituents attached, right? The FTIR shows ester groups. Esters have carbonyl groups, so that should be a big clue. The ester group is usually indicated by a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ in the IR spectrum, which this compound has.

Now, looking at the ¹H NMR data. There are six signals in total. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern could be para, meta, or ortho. But wait, the aromatic signals are two, so maybe each set of equivalent aromatic protons is split into separate signals. For example, if it's a para substitution, you'd have two sets of aromatic protons (each pair of equivalent protons), each giving a singlet or a doublet. But wait, no, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the aromatic protons would each have two equivalent sets. Let me think, maybe in the case of two substituents, each causing some splitting.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to double bonds, so maybe this is from an ester group's structure, like in an ethyl ester or something similar. Wait, ethyl ester would have CH2CH3, but the vinyl part would be the CH2 maybe. Hmm, actually, wait, vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond. So that could be from something like an allyl group or maybe part of the ester's structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a substituent attached to the aromatic ring.

3. Two signals for -CH3 groups. And no -CH2 groups in the NMR. So, the molecule has two methyl groups, each as a singlet perhaps, but no methylene groups. So where could these methyl groups be?

Putting this together. The aromatic ring has two substituents, which are probably ester groups. Wait, no, because an est
