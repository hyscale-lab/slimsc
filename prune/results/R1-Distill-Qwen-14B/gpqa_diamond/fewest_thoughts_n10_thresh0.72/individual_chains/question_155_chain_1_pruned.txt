Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand everything.

The problem describes an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a given matrix form. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which is typical because usually, when dealing with angular momentum, we choose the basis aligned with one of the components, like Pz here.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz of the Pz operator.

Hmm, to find the uncertainty in Pz, I remember that the formula is the square root of the expectation of Pz squared minus the square of the expectation of Pz. So ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

First, I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩, the expectation value of Pz in the given state. Then I compute ⟨Pz²⟩, which should just be the expectation of Pz squared.

Wait, but wait—since the operator Pz is given, I can compute these using matrix multiplication. The state is a vector, and Pz is a matrix. So ⟨Pz⟩ is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by Pz multiplied by the state vector.

Let me write down the given state vector. It's a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ].

But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The components squared are (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4 is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1). Oh, so it's already normalized. That's good.

Now, the matrix for Pz is given as:
Row 1: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, -ħ ]

So, Pz is a diagonal matrix. That simplifies things because when you act Pz on a vector, you just multiply each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

So, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, I need to compute ψ† Pz ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. Since all the elements of ψ are real, ψ† is just [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Multiplying ψ† by Pz:

Each component of ψ will be multiplied by the corresponding Pz elements. So,

⟨Pz⟩ = (-1/2)*ħ * (-1/2) + (1/√2)*0 * (1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2).

Wait, let me think again. Actually, it's ψ† * Pz * ψ.

Wait, no, that's the same as summing each component of ψ multiplied by the corresponding Pz diagonal element multiplied by the same component.

Wait, since Pz is diagonal, when you compute ψ† Pz ψ, it's the same as summing (ψ_i)(Pz_ii)(ψ_i) for each i.

So, let me compute each term:

First element: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

Second element: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0.

Third element: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2 * ħ
