Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. Let me take this step by step. Hmm, the question says the initial state is a 1S0 state, and it emits a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. The Pauli statistics condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, no, the question says the condition is that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Or wait, maybe I should read that again. Oh right, the question says Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So that's an equation modulo 2.

The final state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find out which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different transitions.

First, I think I need to figure out the initial state's quantum numbers. The initial term is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0: S is 0 because 2*0 +1 =1. So S=0. L is the orbital part. The term is S, so L=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0 (since J = L + S =0 +0=0). Wait, but wait, the term is 1S0. So yeah, S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, when a particle X is emitted, the final state is NN plus X. The problem says the system is a bound system, so perhaps the NN part is the final state after emission. So maybe the initial state is NN in a 1S0 state, and they emit X, resulting in the NN system being in some state, and X in some state.

Wait, the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So the NN part is in a state with T=0. I think for two nucleons (like two protons or a proton and neutron), the isospin can be 0 or 1. So in this case, it's T=0.

The question is about which partial wave is not allowed. Each option gives the initial and final states of the NN system, and the emitted particle X. Wait, no: looking at the options, the left side is the initial state, and the right side is the final state plus the emitted particle. Or wait, the left is the initial, and the right shows what the final is plus the emitted, like the initial is 1S0, and it emits X, so the final is something plus X.

Wait, looking at option A: 1S0 â†’7D1 + p. Hmm, wait, no. The initial is 1S0, which I think is the NN state. Then, after emitting X, the NN state becomes 7D1, and X is a proton? Or is X a pion? Wait, the options probably have X as p, s, etc. Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the problem says X is emitted, and X has intrinsic parity -1.
