Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide. Strong acid will react with it, right? Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, the strong acid should dissolve it. So the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid (let's say HCl for example) would produce FeCl3 and water.

So first, I think I need to write the balanced chemical equation. Fe(OH)3 is reacting with HCl. The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

Wait, yes, because Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so it needs three H+ ions to neutralize each OH-.

Okay, so the stoichiometry is 1 mole Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles HCl. So I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So each OH3 is (16 + 3*1) =19 g/mol. Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). So 55.85 + 3*17 (since each OH is 17? Wait, no, wait. Wait, OH- is 17 but in the compound it's OH3, which is three OH groups? Or is it Fe(OH)3 with each OH as OH⁻? Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the molar mass.

Wait, no, Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide. So each OH group has a molar mass of 17 g/mol (O=16, H=1). So three OH groups would contribute 3 * 17 = 51 g/mol. Plus Fe which is 55.85. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles, or 9.36e-4 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol.

So, from the
