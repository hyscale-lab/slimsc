Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting neutral hydrogen clouds using optical telescopes. Hmm, let me think through this. 

Alright, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. Wait, I remember that Lyman alpha is a specific emission line in hydrogen. So when neutral hydrogen is present, it can absorb this wavelength from the quasar's light.

But wait, the quasar is the background object here. So the hydrogen cloud is in front of the quasar from our perspective. The quasar emits light, and if this hydrogen is between us and the quasar, it absorbs the Lyman alpha emission. So the absorption line would be observed at a different wavelength due to redshift.

The question is about the lower limit on the redshift of these hydrogen clouds such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So what's the key here? I think we need to find the minimum redshift where the absorbed light is still in the optical range, because ground-based telescopes can't see infrared, right? Because if the wavelength shifts too much into the infrared, optical telescopes can't detect it.

Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But when the hydrogen cloud is at a high redshift, the wavelength we observe shifts. The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength.

So the observed wavelength
