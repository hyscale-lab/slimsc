Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state, which is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + √3/2|↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd expect to measure over many identical systems. To find the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the given state.

Wait, so the operator is a combination of σz and σx. Both are Pauli matrices, right? So maybe I can compute the expectation values of σz and σx separately and then combine them.

First, let me write down the state |ψ⟩. It's (0.5)|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. Let me check if this is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2. Let's square them and add: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (√3/2)^2 is 3/4 which is 0.75. Adding 0.25 and 0.75 gives 1.0. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, the expectation value of the operator is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I'll compute each term separately.

Starting with ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the probability of finding |↑⟩ multiplied by +1 plus the probability of |↓⟩ multiplied by -1.

The coefficients are 0.5 and √3/2. The probability for |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and for |↓⟩ it's |√3/2|^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So 10 times that is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Next, I need to find ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is another Pauli matrix. Its eigenstates are different. Wait, I think σx has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute ⟨σx⟩ directly using the expectation value formula.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me write out |ψ⟩ as a vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), the state |ψ⟩ is (0.5, √3/2). So the vector form is [0.5; (√3)/2].

The Pauli σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, let's calculate it step by step.

First, compute σx |ψ⟩. The matrix multiplication would be:

σx |ψ⟩ = [ [0 1; 1 0] ] * [0.5; (√3)/2 ]

So the first component is 0*0.5 +1*(√3/2) = √3/2.

The second component is 1*0.5 +0*(√3/2) = 0.5.

So σx |ψ⟩ is [√3/2; 0.5].

Then, ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by this vector. Since all coefficients are real, the conjugate transpose is just [0.5, √3/2].

So the inner product is (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) ) = 2*(0.5 * √3/2 ) = 2*(√3/4) ) = √3/2.

Wait, let me compute
