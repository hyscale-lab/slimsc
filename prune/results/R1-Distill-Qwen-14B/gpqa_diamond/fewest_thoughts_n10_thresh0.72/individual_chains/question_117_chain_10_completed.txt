Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism, right, that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, making them chiral. So they have a plane of asymmetry or a chiral center. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question gives four moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different combinations.

First, let's list the four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

I need to check each for the presence of stereocenters or geometric isomerism that leads to optical activity.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The structure is a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. If the two rings are connected at position 1 and 1', then the substituents at 2 and 2' and 6 and 6' would be on each ring. Wait, but let me think about the substituents. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are the substituents arranged in such a way that there's a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are opposite each other, maybe there's a plane of symmetry, making it meso, which would prevent optical isomerism. Wait, but if the biphenyl has substituents in positions that can create a chiral center, maybe. Alternatively, since it's a biphenyl, maybe the arrangement around the central bond could lead to cis or trans, but I'm not sure. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but for isomerism, it's about the arrangement in the molecule. Oh, wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 2', 6 and 6'. So each ring has two substituents. Are they arranged symmetrically? Maybe each ring is symmetrical, but if the substituents are in such a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetrical, it could be chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule has a center of symmetry, it won't be chiral. It's a bit tricky. Maybe I should think about the substituents. The nitro groups are at 6,6', and the carboxylates at 2,2'. So on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Since 2 and 6 are meta to each other? Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, etc. So position 2 and 6 are across the ring from each other. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So each ring would have two substituents opposite each other, making each ring symmetrical. So the whole molecule would have a mirror plane? Or maybe not. Wait, because the two rings are connected, maybe the entire molecule is symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible that the substituents are in a way that causes the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back later.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. That's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of glycolic acid. The structure would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, no: 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but 2-hydroxy would be CH(OH)CH2COO-. Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. The molecule would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH

Wait, no, the structure is methyl ester, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is HOCH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that structure would have a central CH2 group with OH on one side and COOCH3 on the other. So the structure is:

CH3-O-C-O-C-CH2-OH

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but the hydroxy is on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, that's a straight chain. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Now, does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see: the central carbon is the second carbon (the one with the OH). The groups attached are: OH, CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a propyl group?)
Wait, no, let's count. Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: connected to OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the molecule is CH3-O-C-O-C-CH2-OH. Wait, maybe I should look for the presence of a chiral center. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (carbon 2) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (which is a group)
- two CH2 groups? No, wait, perhaps. Let me think: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one in the middle) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (that's a group)
- two CH2 groups? Or wait, the central carbon is CH2. So the groups would be:

The central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- OH group on the left
- CH2COOCH3 group on the right
- two CH2 groups coming off (one leading to carbon 1 and another to carbon 3? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the hydroxy is on the first CH2 group, and the ester is on the third. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3

So the central carbon (the CH2 in the middle) is connected to:

- CH2(OH) group (the left)
- CH2COOCH3 group (the right)
- and two H's? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Each CH2 has two H's. So the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

Left: CH2(OH)
Right: CH2(COOCH3)
So the central carbon is CH2, meaning it's connected to two CH2 groups and two H's. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. The central carbon is the CH2 between the HOCH2 and CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second CH2. Wait, but in that case, the central carbon is CH2, which is attached to two CH2 groups (left and right) and two H's. So each of those CH2 groups is connected to other parts. Let me think about the substituents on the central carbon. The central carbon is the second CH2 (assuming the chain is HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3). So the central carbon is a CH2, meaning it has two H's, and two CH2 groups attached. Wait, but that's not possible because a carbon can't have four bonds if it's CH2. Oh, right! No, wait, each CH2 is a CH2 group. So the structure is HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2, connected to two CH2 groups? No, wait, that's not possible. Oh, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to:

- OH group
- CH2COOCH3 (a propyl group)
- two CH2 groups (left and right?), but wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon is a CH2, so it's connected to two CH2 groups on either side. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3

So the middle carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- One CH2OH group (left)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (right)
- And two H's.

Wait, but that would make the central carbon have four substituents: two H's, a CH2OH group, and a CH2COOCH3 group. So, the substituents are:

1. H
2. H
3. CH2OH
4. CH2COOCH3

Wait, but that's only two different groups attached. So the central carbon would have two H's, one CH2OH, and one CH2COOCH3. So the substituents are:

- Two H's (same)
- CH2OH
- CH2COOCH3

Wait, but that's three substituents, right? Because each CH2 has two H's. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the molecule: the central carbon is bonded to:

- -CH2OH (left)
- -CH2COOCH3 (right)
- And two H's.

Wait, but that would mean the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups. So, the substituents on the central carbon are two CH2 groups and two H's. That would make it a CH2 group, which is symmetric. So the molecule would be symmetric around the central carbon. Wait, because the groups on either side are CH2OH and CH2COOCH3, which are different. So the substituents are not the same on both sides. So the central carbon would have four different substituents? Wait, no. Because the groups are:

- One CH2OH (left)
- One CH2COOCH3 (right)
- And two H's.

So the substituents are: H, H, CH2OH, CH2COOCH3. So the substituents are two H's (same), CH2OH, and CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is bonded to two identical groups (H), one CH2OH, and one CH2COOCH3. So that's two different groups and two same. So, does that make it a chiral center? Wait, for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. So if the central carbon has two H's and two different groups, it doesn't have four different substituents. So, no chiral center. So compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it's not optically active. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH2 in the middle. So the substituents are:

- CH2OH (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- Two H's.

So four substituents: CH2OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. Only two different substituents on the central carbon. So the central carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center and hence doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Because sometimes, the arrangement of substituents around the central atom can create a chiral center. Oh, wait, maybe the molecule can have a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, but the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The only other possible chiral centers are the carbons in the ester group. The ester group is O-CO-OCH3. So the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to the CH2CH2-OH group and the OCH3. But that carbon is double-bonded, so it's a trigonal planar, not a chiral center. The only other possibility is the carbon with the hydroxyl group, but that's a CH2 group, which can't be a chiral center because it's connected to two Hs. So compound 2 doesn't have any chiral centers. So it cannot show optical isomerism. So, compound 2 is out.

Compound 3: benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)COPh. So the carbonyl group is connected to two phenyl groups. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. So the central carbon is connected to two identical phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms (from the carbonyl group). So the substituents on the central carbon are two phenyls and two oxygens (double bond). Wait, actually, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen, so it's connected to:

- Two phenyl groups
- One O (double bond)
- One single bond to another O (which is part of the carbonyl).

Wait, no, the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar, where Ar is phenyl. So the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and has two Ar groups attached. So the substituents are two Ar groups, one O (double bond), and one R group (the other Ar?), no, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O and two single bonds to each phenyl group. So the carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and an O double bond. So the substituents are:

- Phenyl (twice)
- Double bond O.

So the actual substituents are two phenyls and two O's in a double bond. Wait, no, the double bond is just one substituent. So the substituents are two phenyl groups and a double bond O. The central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) has three substituents: two phenyl groups and the double bond O. So, wait, that's three substituents, but carbon can have four bonds. So actually, the structure is: Ar–C(=O)–Ar. So the central carbon (the carbonyl carbon) has a double bond O and two Ar groups, but that's only three bonds. So the fourth bond is a lone pair? No, because carbonyl carbon can't have a lone pair; it's sp² hybridized with three sigma bonds and one pi bond. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are two Ar groups and one O (double bond). So that's three substituents. Therefore, the carbonyl carbon is trigonal planar, not a chiral center. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, thus no optical isomerism. So compound 3 is out.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Structure: CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but wait, no. Let me think. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH in the trans configuration. So when it forms the dimethyl ester, it becomes CH2=CH-C(=O)OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but as the di-ester, it's CH2=CH-C(=O)OCH3 on both ends, but wait, I think it's more accurate to say that dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3 on both sides, but wait, no. Wait, the di-ester would have two ester groups. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond.

So, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2-CH2 - O-C-OCH3
But wait, that's not right. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct this. Fumarate is the trans di-ester. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3 on each end, but wait, no, each ester is on adjacent carbons. So the correct structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3 is on each end of the double bond. Wait, no, the structure is: 

The molecule is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH when it's maleic acid, but fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the di-ester would be (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3). No, wait, no. The correct structure is O
|
O=C-OCH3 on each side of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O-C-OCH3

But in the case of fumarate, the double bond is between the two central carbons, and the ester groups are on each end. So it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH2 - CH2 - O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be right because that would be a single bond. Wait, no, in fumarate, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's maleate. Fumarate has a double bond. So the correct structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 - CH=CH - O-C-OCH3

No, but that's not correct because that would make the double bond in the middle, and each ester group on either end. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3    O-C-OCH3
           \ /
            C=C

Wait, no, more accurately, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not correct. I think I'm confusing the structures. Let's try to find the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the trans di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H, and fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the dimethyl ester would have the structure:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's the structure of dimethyl succinate. For fumarate, the structure is O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with a double bond. Wait, no, the correct structure is:

The molecule is O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not with a double bond. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should think about the possibility of geometric isomerism. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each side. Therefore, the molecule can have E and Z isomerism. Wait, but in this case, since the substituents are the same (two ester groups), the E and Z isomerism might not result in enantiomers. Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have non-superimposable mirror images. So in the case of dimethyl fumarate, since it's the trans (E) isomer, does it have a geometric isomer that is a mirror image? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let's imagine the structure: it's a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So the groups on either side of the double bond are identical (O-CO-OCH3 on each end). So the molecule would be symmetrical, which would mean it's not chiral. Wait, that's not possible because fumarate is known to have optical activity. Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that can't be right because that's a single bond. Wait, the correct structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, because that's a single bond. I'm getting this wrong. Let me find another approach. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3 on each end? No, that can't be. Wait, no, the actual structure is that each ester group is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me imagine the molecule: the central double bond is between two carbons, each attached to an ester group. So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-CO-OCH3

No, that's not correct. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but let me think about the optical isomerism. Fumarate has E and Z isomers. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then E would be the same as Z, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same (two ester groups), so the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I remember that fumarate does have optical isomerism. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has more than one stereocenter. Wait, no, because it's an ester with a double bond. Wait, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Wait, if the substituents are on opposite sides, but are identical, the molecule might have a center of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents on either side are different, then it could be chiral. But in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are the same (two ester groups), so perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think, if the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't be chiral. So dimethyl fumarate wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I thought fumarate is optically active. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the confusion arises between maleate and fumarate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans. But if the molecule is symmetric, then regardless of being cis or trans, it wouldn't be chiral. Wait, but if the substituents are the same, the trans form would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that dimethyl fumarate is chiral. So in that case, compound 4 wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center or geometric isomerism leading to optical isomerism.

Compound 1: biphenyl with substituents. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other, the molecule could be achiral. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Are those positions symmetrical? Since 2 and 6 are meta to each other, each ring is symmetrical. Then, looking at the biphenyl structure, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the connecting bond. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are not aligned in a way that mirrors each other, the molecule could be chiral. But I'm not certain without drawing it. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same side, making the molecule chiral. But without knowing, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple stereocenters. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each compound and determine if they have any stereocenters or geometric isomerism leading to optical activity.

Compound 1: biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates asymmetry, the molecule could be chiral. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's not.

Compound 2: No chiral centers, as discussed earlier.

Compound 3: Benzophenone, no chiral centers.

Compound 4: Dimethyl fumarate. If the structure is trans, and the substituents are the same on each side, the molecule may be achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are different, it would be chiral. But in this case, the substituents are the same (two ester groups), so maybe the molecule is symmetrical. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought fumarate is the trans isomer, but if the substituents are the same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Let's think of the structure again. If the structure is such that there's a stereocenter, then it would have optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond has substituents leading to geometric isomerism, but if the substituents are the same, it's not chiral. So maybe dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, going back to the options:

Which of the compounds have optical isomerism?

From my analysis:

1: unsure, possibly no.

2: no.

3: no.

4: unsure, possibly no.

Hmm, that can't be right because the options given have some correct answers. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomerism. Because fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate, and it's known to have optical activity. So perhaps I was wrong in my earlier analysis. If the substituents are the same, the molecule might still be chiral if there's no plane of symmetry.

Wait, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are the same (like two identical groups), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But if the substituents are different, then the molecule could be chiral. So in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are two ester groups. If they are on opposite sides (trans), but the same, then the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So it wouldn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's conflicting with what I know. Because I thought that fumarate is optically active. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is between the diastereomers and enantiomers. Let me think again.

If the molecule has a double bond with two identical substituents on each side (same groups), then the E and Z isomers are actually the same due to a plane of symmetry. For example, 2-pentene has E and Z isomers when the substituents are different. But if the substituents are the same, E and Z are identical. So in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are the same (two ester groups), so the E and Z isomers are the same, meaning the molecule is achiral. Therefore, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but then none of the compounds would exhibit optical isomerism, which can't be right because the options don't have that as an option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again. Compound 1 is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So the structure is biphenyl, with each ring having a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other. So each ring is symmetrical with substituents at 2 and 6. Now, when connected as a biphenyl, the arrangement could lead to asymmetry.

Wait, the biphenyl itself can have different conformations, but for isomerism, the substituents' arrangement matters. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the overall molecule to lack a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, if each substituent on one ring is mirrored by a substituent on the other ring, the molecule would be achiral.

Wait, let's imagine the biphenyl as two benzene rings connected at position 1. On each ring, position 2 has a carboxylate, and position 6 has a nitro group. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6. Now, if the molecule is such that the substituents on one ring are aligned in a way that their mirror images are on the other ring, the molecule would be symmetrical. But if not, it's asymmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the entire molecule is symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading it to be achiral. So compound 1 wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think of another approach: which of the given options are correct.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D)1,2

From earlier analysis, I thought:

Compound 2: no optical isomerism.

Compound 3: no.

Compounds 1 and 4: uncertain.

If I think that only compound 4 shows optical isomerism, but earlier analysis suggested no, then perhaps none of the options are correct. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl is on a chiral center. Let me re-examine the structure.

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is the second carbon. So the groups attached are:

- CH2(OH)
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- Two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- CH2OH (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- And two H's.

So the substituents on the second carbon are:

- CH2OH (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- Two H's.

So, four substituents:

1. CH2OH
2. CH2COOCH3
3. H
4. H

So, two substituents are H's (same), and the other two are different. Therefore, the second carbon is connected to two identical groups (H's) and two different groups. So, can this be a chiral center? No, because for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So, since there are two H's, the substituents are not all different. Therefore, no chiral center. So compound 2 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry elsewhere? No, because the substituents are not symmetric around any plane. But without a chiral center, it can't be chiral.

Now, let's think about compound 4 again. Dimethyl fumarate.

If the structure is such that the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but are identical, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Another approach: look up which compounds commonly exhibit optical isomerism.

Benzophenone (compound 3) doesn't have any chiral centers, so no.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2) doesn't have a chiral center, so no.

Dimethyl fumarate: If it's in the E configuration (trans), and the substituents are same on both sides, then it's symmetrical and not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then it could be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each compound again.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are meta. So each ring is symmetrical. When connected, the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's achiral. So no optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: no chiral center, so no.

3. benzophenone: no chiral center, no.

4. dimethyl fumarate: if the substituents are same on each side, then no.

Wait, but that leaves none of the compounds showing optical isomerism, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: which of the compounds have a chiral center or geometric isomerism leading to optical isomerism.

Perhaps compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Even though the substituents are the same, if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. Wait, but if it's the trans isomer, then the groups are on opposite sides, but if they are same, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So no.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that the substituents are different. Oh! Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, each ester group is connected to a methyl group. So the substituents on the double bond are two OCOOCH3 groups. So the substituents are the same on each side, leading to a plane of symmetry. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D) 1,2

From my analysis, none of the compounds show optical isomerism, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Now, in a biphenyl structure, the substituents can be arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on the same side or opposite sides of the central bond, this could lead to asymmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in a way that the molecule has a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule itself is chiral due to the arrangement of substituents around the central bond.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound, making it achiral. If the substituents are arranged such that there's an internal plane of symmetry, the molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another thought: if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image, it would be chiral. For example, if the substituents on one ring are in a certain orientation relative to the other ring, the molecule could be chiral.

But perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center in the biphenyl system, but I don't think that's the case because biphenyls typically don't have chiral centers unless there's a specific arrangement.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think again about the options and the possible correct answer.

The options are A, B, C, D. Based on my earlier analysis, I'm not sure. But perhaps the correct answer is A) 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but I thought compounds 1 and 4 don't show optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 4 only. But I don't see that as an option.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the compounds with known optical activity.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: I don't think so, because it doesn't have a chiral center.

Benzophenone: No.

Dimethyl fumarate: It is known to exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, because it's the trans isomer (E), and perhaps has a chiral center. No, wait, fumarate doesn't have a chiral center; it's about geometric isomerism. But if the substituents are the same, the E and Z isomers are identical. So perhaps it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Maybe dimethyl fumarate does have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another approach: which of these compounds have a plane of asymmetry or a chiral center.

Compound 1: No chiral center, but maybe the molecule is chiral due to the arrangement of substituents around the biphenyl.

Compound 2: No.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So, perhaps only compound 1 and 4 have optical isomerism. But in the options, option A includes 1,2,4. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me think again.

If the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Thus, none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about stereoisomerism, which includes both constitutional and stereoisomerism. But no, the question is about optical isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry. For example, compound 1: if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are symmetric across the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral.

So, in that case, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, because I thought compound 2 doesn't have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me re-examine it.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe it's CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. So, the structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. Wait, no, that's the structure of ethyl glycolate or something else. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO-.

As an ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

HOCH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon is the CH2 between the hydroxyl and the COOCH3. So the central carbon is connected to:

- HOCH2 (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- Two H's.

So, substituents are:

- HOCH2 (left)
- CH2COOCH3 (right)
- H (two).

So, four substituents: two H's, HOCH2, CH2COOCH3. Therefore, two substituents are same (H), the others are different. So, the central carbon has two H's, making it not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is none of the compounds, but that's not an option. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about compound 4 again. If the substituents are same on each side of the double bond, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. But if the substituents are different, it would have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are different. For example, if one side has an ester and the other has something else, but in dimethyl fumarate, both sides are esters. So same substituents, making the molecule symmetrical.

So, I think I've reached the limit of my analysis. Based on my analysis, none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, I must choose the best possible option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Maybe it does have a chiral center.

Wait, if the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6, perhaps the central bond allows for a chiral arrangement. But I can't see how that would create a chiral center. Biphenyls themselves aren't chiral unless there's an asymmetric substitution pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral.

In the end, I think the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 4 is a trans di-ester, which can exhibit geometric isomerism. But since the substituents are the same, it's not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option A) 1,2,4. But I'm not certain.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to a chiral center or geometric isomerism.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   The structure consists of a biphenyl system with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring is symmetrical, and the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH2-OH. The central carbon (second carbon) is bonded to two identical groups (two H's), one -CH2COOCH3 group, and one -CH2OH group. Since not all four substituents are different, this carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule does not exhibit optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   The structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to two identical phenyl groups. This arrangement makes the molecule symmetrical and achiral, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3. The double bond has two identical ester groups (COOCH3) on either side. Since the substituents on both sides of the double bond are the same, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Thus, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
None of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism based on the analysis. However, since this conclusion does not align with the provided options, the most plausible answer based on the reasoning is **A) 1, 2, and 4**, despite the uncertainty in the analysis.
