Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. So each compound has the formula C5H7, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the molecular formula of each compound is C10H14? Or is the mixture C10H14? Hmm, no, wait, the mixture is a solution of two aromatic compounds each with C10H14. So each compound has 10 carbons and 14 hydrogens. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14 for each, because the mixture is a 1:1 of two C10H14 compounds. Wait, no, each of the two components has a C10H14 molecular formula. Because the problem says the solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. So each one is C10H14.

Wait, the options given are all tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene. Let me check the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4 and 1,2,3,5. Each would have four methyl groups attached to benzene. So each would be C6H5(C4H9), but wait, no. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3. So four methyl groups would add 4*3=12 H. So the formula would be C10H14? Let's see: C6H5(C4H9)—wait, wait, no, it's C6H5 with four methyl groups. Each methyl is CH3. So the compound is C6H5(CH3)4. The formula would be C6 + 4 C = C10. Hydrogens: benzene is C6H6. Each methyl has 3 H, but when attached to benzene, they lose an H (since benzene is sp² hybridized, but for the substitution, each methyl is like -CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, when you have a benzene ring with a methyl group, it's -CH2CH3? No, no, wait, no. No, wait, a methyl group on benzene is CH3 attached directly to the ring. So each CH3 contributes 3 H. So four CH3 groups would be 4*3=12 H. Benzene has 6 H. So total H is 6 + 12 = 18. But the molecular formula is C10H14. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe each compound is a diethyl benzene? Let's see option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Each has four methyl groups. So each is C6H5(CH3)4. So that's C
