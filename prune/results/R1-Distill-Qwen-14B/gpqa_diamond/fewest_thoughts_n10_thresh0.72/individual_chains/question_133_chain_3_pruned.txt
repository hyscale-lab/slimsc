Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1.00 grams each, and the volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The question gives me the Ka values for H3PO4, which are Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12. 

Wait, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The first dissociation is the strongest, then each subsequent one is weaker. So the species in solution would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But since the salts given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, they will dissociate into their ions. 

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- ions, right? So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. 

The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2- (since orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and the phosphate ions are the conjugate bases). But wait, wait. No, orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Or maybe the term orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- form. I think in this context, orthophosphate is HPO4^2- because it's the deprotonated form from H2PO4^-.

But wait, the options are all in the order of 1e-7 M, which is quite low. So I'm probably dealing with a buffer solution here, because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or wait, in this case, the two salts provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which can act as a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, the solution is a buffer solution consisting of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). The pH of the solution will determine the ratio of these two ions. But wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be HPO4^2-.

To find the concentration, I think I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Wait, but which pKa do I use here? Since H2PO4^- is an acid that can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, this is the second dissociation step of H3PO4. The p
