Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Let me read the question again carefully.

So there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, Planet3. They have circular orbits, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But maybe that's not important for this problem.

The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The question is about finding how much larger the orbital period of Planet3 is compared to Planet1.

Hmm. Equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3, so T2/T3 = 2.3. So wait, maybe I should write it as T1 over T2 and T2 over T3.

Wait, the ratios are given as approx 1.4 and 2.3. So T1/T2 ≈ 1.4, and T2/T3≈2.3. So T1 is higher than T2, and T2 is higher than T3. So Planet3 is the coldest, Planet1 the hottest.

Then the mass ratios: Planet1/Planet2 ≈1.15, so M1/M2=1.15. And M2/M3≈1.35, so M2 is 1.35 times M3. So M1 is 1.15*M2, which is 1.15*1.35*M3 = approx 1.5525*M3.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period. So I think I need to relate the orbital period to other parameters like mass and temperature.

Wait, the planets are orbiting a star, right? So Kepler's third law comes into play here. Because Kepler's law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. But wait, the problem doesn't mention the mass of the star, so maybe the star's mass is the same for all planets, as they're part of the same system.

So the formula for Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis, M is the mass of the star. Rearranged, a³ = [G M P²]/(4π²). But since all planets are in the same system, M is the same for all. So the semi-major axis is proportional to (P²)^(1/3) multiplied by the cube root of (M) but M is same, so a is proportional to P^(2/3). Wait, no, wait: actually, a^3 is proportional to P². So a is proportional to P^(2/3). Wait, but that's for a given star mass.

But wait, the problem gives us equilibrium temperatures, which depend on the semi-major axis. Equilibrium temperature T is given by the formula:

T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (assuming albedo a) is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Wait, but the star's luminosity L is related to its radius and temperature as L = 4π R_star² σ T_star^4. So substituting that into the equilibrium temperature equation:

T_planet = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4)
= [ (4π R_star² σ T_star^4 (1 - a)) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4)
= [ (R_star² T_star^4 (1 - a)) / (4 a²) ) ]^(1/4)
= T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^(1/2) * (1 - a)^(1/4 )

So T_planet is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (1 - a)^(1/4 )

But in this problem, the albedo (a) is the same for all three planets, 0.3, so (1 - a) is 0.7 for all. So the (1 - a) term is same for all, so it doesn't affect the ratio. So the ratio of temperatures will be sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * (same factor), but since R_star and a are involved, perhaps we can find the ratio of a between the planets based on the temperature ratios.

Wait, but since all three planets are in the same system, the star's R_star is the same for all. So T_planet is proportional to sqrt(1/a) * (1 - a)^(1/4 )

But since (1 - a) is same for all, the T ratio simplifies to sqrt(1/a). Or wait, more accurately, T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * (1 - a)^(1/4 )

Wait, let me think again. Since R_star and (1 - a) are the same for all three planets, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the semi-major axes. Let's denote T1, T2, T3 as the equilibrium temperatures of the three planets. Then:

T1 / T2 = [ (a2 / a1 ) ]^(0.5)

Wait, because T is proportional to sqrt(1/a). So if T1 is larger than T2, then a1 must be smaller than a2. Because sqrt(1/a) is larger when a is smaller. So larger temperature implies closer to the star.

So given that, the ratio of T1 to T2 is 1.4. So T1 = 1.4 * T2. So [ (a2/a1) ]^0.5 = 1.4 → a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 is approximately 1.96 times a1. So a2 = 1.96 a1.

Similarly, T2 to T3 is 2.3. So T2 = 2.3 T3. So [ (a3/a2) ]^0.5 = 2.3 → a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 → a3 =5.29 a2.

So putting it together: a2 =1.96 a1, a3 =5.29 a2=5.29 *1.96 a1 ≈ 10.37 a1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, according to Kepler's third law, since the semi-major axis is much larger for Planet3, its orbital period should be longer.

The formula is P² ∝ a³ / (M_star), assuming the mass of the star is much larger than the planet masses (which is usually the case). But since all planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for all, so P² is proportional to a³.

So P3 / P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2).

Wait, wait: a3 is 10.37 a1, so (a3/a1)=10.37.

So (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(3/2). Let me compute that.

First, compute sqrt(10.37) ≈ 3.22. Then cube that: 3.22^3 ≈ 3.22 *3.22=10.3684, multiplied by 3.22 again: 10.3684 *3.22 ≈ 33.34.

So P3 is about 33.34 times P1. So the factor is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but wait, wait. Kepler's law says P² ∝ a³/(M_star). But M_star is the mass of the star. But if the planet's mass is significant, would that affect the period? Hmm, but in reality, the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, so the planet's mass can be neglected. So the formula P² ∝ a³/(M_star) holds. So yes, the ratio depends on a³.

But wait, the problem also gives the mass ratios of the planets. Why are the masses given? Oh, perhaps I didn't need them. Let me check.

Wait, I used only the temperature ratios to get the a ratios, and then used Kepler's law. The masses of the planets don't come into play here because Kepler's law depends on the star's mass, not the planet's. So the mass ratios may not affect the orbital periods in this scenario. So perhaps the masses are a distractor, or perhaps they are not needed for this particular calculation.

So the conclusion is that the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1. So the answer would be option D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the given data and apply Kepler's third law along with the relationship between equilibrium temperature and semi-major axis.

### Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperatures to Semi-Major Axes
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is proportional to \( \sqrt{\frac{1}{a}} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Since the albedo is the same for all three planets, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures depends only on the semi-major axes. Given:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 1.4 \)
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} \approx 2.3 \)

From \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \), we find:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_2 = 1.96 a_1
\]

From \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \), we find:
\[
\frac{a_3}{a_2} = \left(\frac{T_2}{T_3}\right)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_3 = 5.29 a_2
\]

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \), we get:
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 a_1 \approx 10.37 a_1
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet3 is approximately 10.37 times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Applying Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Since all planets orbit the same star, the proportionality constant is the same for all. Therefore:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.37 \), we calculate:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
\]

First, compute \( \sqrt{10.37} \):
\[
\sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22
\]

Then, cube this result:
\[
(3.22)^3 \approx 3.22 \times 3.22 \times 3.22 \approx 33.34
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times that of Planet1.

### Conclusion
The factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1 is approximately **33.4**.
