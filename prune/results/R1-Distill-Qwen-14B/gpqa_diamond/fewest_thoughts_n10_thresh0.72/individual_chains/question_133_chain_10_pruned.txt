Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the given Ka values are for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 is 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 is 1.8x10^-12.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I should figure out the molar amounts of each of these salts. Because they dissociate in water, they'll contribute to the concentration of HPO4^2- ions, I think.

Let me recall: KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, right? Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. So when KH2PO4 dissolves, it gives K+ and H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Because the formula is Na2(HPO4), so each unit gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. So the two salts are providing different species. KH2PO4 gives H2PO4^-, and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

So, wait, but both these salts might contribute to phosphate species, but only one gives the HPO4^2- directly. Let me think.

Wait, but
