Okay, so I have this physics problem here about uncertainty in an electron's energy. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with uncertainties in quantum mechanics, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle comes into play. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says the electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least on the order of Planck's constant over 4π. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can treat it as equality: Δx * Δp = h/(4π).

But wait, Planck's constant is usually given as h = 6.626e-34 J·s. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as ħ (h-bar), which is h/(2π). So, ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s. Maybe that's easier to work with.

So, rearranging the equation to solve for Δp: Δp = h/(4πΔx). Alternatively, in terms of ħ, that's Δp = ħ/(Δx). Wait, let me clarify. Let me write the equation again:

Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Oh right, because h/(4π) is the same as ħ/2. Yeah, because ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) = ħ/(2). Hmm, so the uncertainty principle can be written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2.

Wait wait, no. Let me calculate. h/(4π) is (6.626e-34)/(4 * 3.1416) ≈ (6.626e-34)/(12.566) ≈ 5.28e-35 J·s. Alternatively, ħ is about 1.05e-34 J·s, so half of that is 5.25e-35, which matches. So yeah, the product is approximately ħ/2.

But for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's better
