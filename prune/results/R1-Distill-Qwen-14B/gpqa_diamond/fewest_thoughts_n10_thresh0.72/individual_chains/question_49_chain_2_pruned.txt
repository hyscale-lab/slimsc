Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond with the movement of pi bonds. The question has three parts, each involving a different reaction, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the given options.

Let me start by looking at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under acidic conditions and heat to form compound A. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Or maybe I should double-check. But-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on carbon 2, and the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. But wait, but is four carbons. So the structure is CH2CH2 is but-3-en-2-ol. No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, because but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 with a double bond between 3 and 4? Wait no, that's but-1-en-2-ol. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but butane only has four carbons, so numbering from 1 to 4. So the structure would be CH2CH2. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are part of a Claisen rearrangement.

Wait, the reagent is H+ and heat. So perhaps this is a Claisen-type rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine? Wait, no, the Claisen rearrangement typically involves 1,1-dimethoxyethane, which upon heating, rearranges to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But wait, in this case, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So perhaps it's a variation
