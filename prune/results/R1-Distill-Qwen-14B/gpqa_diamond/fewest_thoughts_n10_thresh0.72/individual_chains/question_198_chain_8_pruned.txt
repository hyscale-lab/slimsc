Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're asked to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, okay. So first, I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it means the reaction goes more to the product. The complexes here are probably Co with different numbers of SCN- ligands.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)]^n-, right? The β values are for the stepwise formation. So β1 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 would be the next step, adding another SCN- to make [Co(SCN)₂]^0, and so on. Wait, but sometimes people define stability constants for the overall formation. Wait, I'm a bit confused about whether these βs are stepwise or overall. Oh, right, stepwise stability constants are for each successive addition. So β1 is the first association, β2 is the second, etc.

So the possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}. The β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63), which seems a bit odd. I'm not sure if that's a typo or if it's correct. But I'll go with what's given.

We're looking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think in Co(II) chemistry, the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2], which is usually blue. So the species [Co(SCN)_2] is the one we're interested in.

So the plan is to calculate the concentration of each Co species and then find what percentage [Co(SCN)_2] is out of the total.

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all possible species. So:

Total Co = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^{2-}]

Wait, but wait, the problem says "the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M." So that sum equals 1e-2 M.

But when calculating the species, I'll need to express each in terms of [Co^2+] and the βs.

Alternatively, we can model this using the formation of complexes step by step.

Let me outline the formation steps:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ ; β1 = 9
2. [Co
