Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components: P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like angular momentum are represented as vectors. So the total operator P would be the sum of its components multiplied by the direction vector n. Oh right, because the operator along an arbitrary direction is given by the dot product of the vector operator and the direction unit vector. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z).

But wait, the direction n is lying in the x-z plane. So the direction vector must be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, any direction in the x-z plane would have θ measured from the z-axis. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ * cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, wait. No, because in the x-z plane, φ is zero or something? Or perhaps I'm mixing things up. Wait, n is in the x-z plane, so the angle φ would be 0 or 180 degrees. Hmm, but maybe in this case since it's arbitrary, we can just say n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero.

So the operator P would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but I'm being asked for the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find a vector |ψ> such that P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

First, I should express P in terms of the given components.

Given that each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let's compute this.

n_x is sinθ, since n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). And n_z is cosθ.

So P = (sinθ)(P_x) + (cosθ)(P_z).

Substituting in the matrices:

P = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute the matrix elements.

Each term is multiplied by ħ/2. So adding the matrices:

Top row: ( sinθ * 0 + cosθ * 1 ) , ( sinθ * 1 + cosθ * 0 ) 
Bottom row: ( sinθ *1 + cosθ *0 ), ( sinθ *0 + cosθ*(-1) )

Wait, so the matrices are:

First term (P_x scaled by sinθ):

[ [0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Second term (P_z scaled by cosθ):

[ [cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So adding them together:

P = (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
               [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So the matrix representing operator P is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, to find the eigenvector of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the equation is: P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

But wait, wait. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So the matrix equation becomes:

( (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] ) * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b].

We can factor out ħ/2 from
