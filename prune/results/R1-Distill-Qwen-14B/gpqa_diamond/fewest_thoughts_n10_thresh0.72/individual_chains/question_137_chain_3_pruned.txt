Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. But wait, synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, right? I think they work by having the particles move in a magnetic field and get accelerated by an electric field that changes direction at each half-cycle.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ₀]. The given data are Φ₀ = π/4 and U₀ = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about what exactly happens in a synchrocyclotron. In a regular cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is fixed, and as the particles gain energy, their orbit radius increases. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is kept constant, and the electric field's frequency is adjusted so that the particles stay in phase with the accelerating field as they gain energy. Oh right, because if the frequency isn't adjusted, the particles would lose synchronization as they speed up.

But wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, not sure about that. Maybe it's accelerated twice to reach the desired energy.
