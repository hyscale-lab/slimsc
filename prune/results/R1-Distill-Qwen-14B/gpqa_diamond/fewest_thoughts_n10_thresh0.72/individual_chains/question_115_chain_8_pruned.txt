Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the problem says an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're electron and positron, their masses are equal but charges opposite. The conservation laws here would be conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, Lorentz factors are given. Lorentz factor gamma is equal to the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. For an electron, the rest mass is about 0.511 MeV. So the total energy of each particle is gamma * m_e c².

But wait, the positron has the same mass as the electron, right? So the electron's energy is gamma_e * m_e c², and the positron's is gamma_p * m_e c².

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving from the right. So if the electron is moving to the right (from left), the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Let me think about their momenta. The momentum of a relativistic particle is p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, p can also be expressed as gamma * m * beta * c, where beta is v/c.

Wait, but if the particles are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. So the electron's momentum is positive (to the right), and the positron's is negative (to the left), or vice versa, depending on how we set the coordinate system.

But when they annihilate, the system's total energy and momentum must equal the photons' energies and momenta. Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momenta vectors are in those directions.

Wait, but the problem states that both photons have the same energy. Since photons' energy is related to their frequency and speed, but their direction is given, their momenta magnitudes would depend on the angle. Wait, no, because the momentum of a photon is E/c in the direction of motion. So if both have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude but different directions.

Wait, but in this problem, each photon has the same energy. So if both have same E, then their momentum magnitudes are E/c each, because p_photon = E/c.

So to find the angle between the two photons, maybe I can consider the conservation of momentum. The total momentum of the system before annihilation must equal the total after.

Let me model this.

First, let's compute the initial total momentum.

Electron is moving right: let's say along the positive x-direction.

Positron is moving left: so along negative x, but wait, it's moving from the right, so maybe its velocity is to the left, which is negative x.

Wait the problem states: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so its direction is to the right (positive x). The positron is also moving along the horizontal axis from
