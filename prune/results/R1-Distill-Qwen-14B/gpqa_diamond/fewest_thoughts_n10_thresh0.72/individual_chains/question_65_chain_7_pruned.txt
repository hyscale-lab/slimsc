Okay, so I need to figure out the major products A and B from these two reactions and then select the correct option. Let's break them down one by one.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol with THF, KH, H+. Hmm, what's going on here. I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. Wait, but after that, there's H+, so maybe an acid workup?

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro means two rings connected by a single atom. The structure is 1-vinyl, so there's a double bond (vinyl group) attached at position 1. The spiro is between a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring? Wait, spiro[3.5]non... So the main chain is 9 carbons, but split into two rings. Oh wait, wait... no. Spiro compounds have two rings connected at one atom. So spiro[3.5]non would have a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring, right? So the main chain is nonane (9 carbons), but arranged as a spiro system.

The structure would be like a bridge between two rings. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the bridgehead, meaning the OH is also on that same position. So, the structure has a double bond (vinyl) at position 1, and the spiro is also at position 1, making that a bridgehead.

When you have a spiro system with a strong base like KH (which is a hydride source, maybe), what reaction happens? I'm thinking elimination or some kind of ring-forming. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of a Cope elimination or some electrocyclic reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the conditions are THF, KH, then H+. So, maybe deprotonation is happening. Let's think about the structure. The molecule has a hydroxyl group on the bridgehead, adjacent to the vinyl group.

So, the OH is on the bridgehead. When treated with a strong base like KH, the OH might lose a proton, generating an alkoxide. But then, where would the hydride come into play? Alternatively, maybe the base deprotonates the alcohol, making an
