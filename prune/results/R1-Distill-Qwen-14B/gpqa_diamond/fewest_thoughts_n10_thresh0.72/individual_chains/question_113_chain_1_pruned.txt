Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to match these observations to one of the four possible formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The options are labeled A to D.

Starting with the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. So that suggests the compound has either an alcohol (-OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300, maybe even broader. But sometimes, if it's an alcohol, it's also a broad peak, but maybe less so. But the question says "very broad," so maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Or maybe it's an alcohol, but perhaps with hydrogen bonding, making it broad.

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typically a carbonyl group (C=O). But wait, 1650 is lower than that. What could that be? Maybe conjugation? Like an aromatic ring or something else. Oh, wait, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is another group. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is an ester or ketone, and the 1650 is something else, perhaps an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds. Or maybe it's an amide? But I don't think that's one of the options here, since the options don't have nitrogen.

Wait, the 1650 peak could be from a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Alternatively, maybe it's a C=C stretching. Oh, but the question also mentions in the NMR that there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the molecule has a double bond.

So putting this together: the compound has an O-H (from the broad peak), a carbonyl group (1700), perhaps an aromatic ring or a conjugated system (1650). Also, there's a vinyl group.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: they observed several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. So that double bond is present. So maybe the structure has a conjugated diene or a single double bond. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests something like CH2=CH- structure.

Now, the Mass Spec part: a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give m/z 45? I remember that m/z 45 can correspond to certain common ions. For example, the (CH3)2CO+ ion (acetone) is at m/z 58. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Maybe a CH3CH2OH+ would be 45? Because molecular weight of ethyl alcohol is 46 (C2H5OH: 12*2 + 6 +16 +1 = 46). So the fragment at m/z 45 is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CH3)2O+ ion. Let me calculate that: CH3-O- would have a molecular weight of 45? Wait, CH3O+ would be (12 + 3*1) +16 = 31? No, wait, that's 12 (C) + 3 H + 16 O = 31. Wait, maybe the fragment is something else. Oh, wait, another possibility: the fragment could
