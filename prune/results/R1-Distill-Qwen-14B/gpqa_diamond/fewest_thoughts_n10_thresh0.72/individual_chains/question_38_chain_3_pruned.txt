Okay, I need to figure out the product B and the correct sequence of reagents A in this enamine reaction. Let's start by understanding the reaction given.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. The structure would be an enamine because it's a secondary amine (since N has two R groups) attached to a carbonyl, but more accurately, an enamine is a compound formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl via a condensation reaction.

Wait, actually, the starting material here is an enamine. Enamines are typically formed by reacting a ketone or aldehyde with a secondary amine, followed by elimination of water. But in this case, the starting material is the enamine itself, so the reaction here is probably using it in a way that it undergoes another reaction, perhaps a nucleophilic substitution or some kind of addition.

The reaction is A â†’ B. So, the reagents in A are applied to the starting enamine to form product B.

Looking at the options, let's see the reagents involved. The options mention LDA (lithium diisopropylamide), DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane), CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide), and H3O+ (acid workup).

Wait, LDA is a strong base, often used to deprotonate things. DME is a solvent. Maybe it's used
