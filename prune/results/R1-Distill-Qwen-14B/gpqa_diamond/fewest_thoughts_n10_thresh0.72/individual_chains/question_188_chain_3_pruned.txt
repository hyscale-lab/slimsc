Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the unit cell parameters and some trigonometric functions. 

Wait, rhombohedral crystal... right, that's one of the seven crystal systems. In a rhombohedral system, all the edges are equal, so a = b = c, and all the angles are the same, alpha, beta, gamma. Oh wait, in the question, the angles are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The interatomic distance given is 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait. Wait, interatomic distance — that's the distance between atoms, right? So in the crystal structure, each atom is spaced at 10 Angstroms. But does that mean the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom? Or is it different because of the angles?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh! Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be equal to the lattice parameter a because each atom is at the corner, and the edge length is the distance between adjacent atoms. But in a rhombohedral structure, especially with angles other than 90 degrees, the actual interatomic distance (the distance between nearest atoms) is the same as a, I think. So maybe a is 10 Angstroms here.

But wait, rhombohedral can be a special case. Wait, no, the interatomic distance in a simple cubic structure is indeed a, but in more complex structures, like face-centered or body-centered, it's different. But since this is a rhombohedral, which is a type of hexagonal system? Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system? Wait, no, wait. No, I think the rhombohedral system is a separate system where all the edges are equal, and the angles are the same but not 90 degrees. So in this case, the lattice parameter is a, and the interatomic distance is the same as a. So a is 10 Angstrom.

So the problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + kl + lh)/(a² cos² α) * something? Wait, maybe I should recall the formula correctly.

Oh right, for a rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + kl + lh)/(a² cos² α) * (1/2) ?

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the general formula. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system can be derived from the unit cell parameters. For a cubic system, the formula is straightforward. But for a rhombohedral,
