Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds. They are pericyclic reactions, which include things like electrocyclic and cycloadditions. The question gives three reactions and asks me to match the products with the options A to D.

Let me start by looking at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. The structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2? No, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the structure where the ethanamine (NH2CH2CH2-) has two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So, it's (NH2)(OCH3)2CH2? Or maybe more accurately, the structure is NC(OCH3)2CH2? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but in this case, 1,1-dimethoxy would mean the methoxy groups are on the same carbon as the amine. So, it's H2N-C(OCH3)2? Like, the carbon with the NH2 has two OCH3 groups attached.

But-3-en-2-ol is another reactant. But-3-en-2-ol has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with an OH group on carbon 2. Structure: CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait. The butene has four carbons. The double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have the structure CH2CH(OH)CH2. No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused
