Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think this through step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 T. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so m is much less than some value maybe? Wait, paramagnetic coupling... I remember that paramagnetism has to do with the magnetic moment due to electrons, but not sure about the exact terms here.

The problem is asking to compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy associated with the magnetic interaction) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The transition wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line. Oh right, the wavelength for the transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen is about 0.486 micrometers, giving a specific energy ΔE.

So I need to find the magnitude of the paramagnetic term and compare it with this ΔE.

First, let's calculate ΔE from the given wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me plug in the numbers. h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The
