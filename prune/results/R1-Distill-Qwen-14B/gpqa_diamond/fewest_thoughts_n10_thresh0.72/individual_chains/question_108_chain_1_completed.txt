Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about comparing the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The magnetic field B is given as 1 Tesla and is parallel to the Oz axis. They mention m is small, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. 

Hmm, okay, I remember that paramagnetic coupling has something to do with the interaction between the magnetic moments of electrons and the external magnetic field. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

So, the paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is usually given by the Zeeman term, right? The Zeeman effect deals with the splitting of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field. The energy due to this effect should be proportional to the magnetic quantum number m. The formula I recall is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. 

Wait, the magnetic moment μ for an electron is related to its spin. Oh wait, but this is about orbital magnetic quantum number m. Oh, right, the orbital magnetic moment is given by μ = (eħ/(2m)) * (L), and then when you apply the magnetic field, the energy is μ·B. But wait, for the orbital part, the magnetic quantum number is m, so the energy should be proportional to m times B. 

Wait, but wait. The orbital Zeeman effect energy is given by E = (μ0/(4π)) * (e^2/(2m)) * (m_s * B), where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number? Or is it m_l for orbital? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me get this straight. The orbital Zeeman effect is for the orbital angular momentum L, which has quantum numbers l and m. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field would be E = (μ_B * m), where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, no, the Bohr magneton is for spin. Oh right, the orbital part uses the Landé g-factor, but perhaps I'm getting into more complicated territory here.

Alternatively, the paramagnetic coupling term is often considered as the interaction between the spin magnetic moment and the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for that would be H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ = -g_s μ_B S, where g_s is the spin g-factor (~2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, so the expectation value of H would be <H> = g_s μ_B <S> · B. Since B is along Oz, let's say the z-axis. So <S_z> would be m_s * ħ/2, but m_s can be ±1/2 for electrons. So, the expectation value would be proportional to m_s * μ_B * B. 

Wait, but the question is about the paramagnetic coupling term. So perhaps the main term is the Zeeman term. And the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states, say between two different m values. For hydrogen, the energy levels are split due to the Zeeman effect. 

But wait, in the hydrogen atom, the splitting due to the Zeeman effect is much smaller than the splitting due to other effects like the Stark effect or the fine structure. But the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman term) to the transition energy ΔE. 

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is given by the energy difference between two states. In hydrogen, the main energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula. But when considering fine structure or Zeeman effect, the energy shifts are much smaller. 

Wait, the Rydberg constant R is about 13.6 eV. The energy difference between adjacent levels (like n=1 to n=2) is about 10.2 eV. But that's the main energy difference. The Zeeman splitting for hydrogen in a weak magnetic field is much smaller. 

So, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman term, would be much smaller than the energy levels themselves. But in this question, we're comparing it to the transition energy ΔE. Wait, what is the order of magnitude of the Zeeman shift? 

The Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.274 x 10^-24 J/T. Then, the Zeeman energy is E_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. Here, m is the magnetic quantum number, which can be up to l for electrons, but for hydrogen's ground state, l=0, so m=0. Wait, no, for higher states, l can be non-zero. Wait, but the question says m is small, maybe m=0 or ±1? 

Wait, but for hydrogen, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be from -l to +l. If m is small, perhaps m=0. But in that case, the Zeeman term would be zero. Hmm, maybe the magnetic field is applied, and the term is considering the interaction with the magnetic moment of the electron. Oh wait, I think I might be confusing orbital and spin terms. 

Wait, the paramagnetic term is due to the spin-orbit coupling, but no, wait. Paramagnetism is due to the electron's spin. Oh, right, the paramagnetic effect comes from the spin magnetic moment interacting with the external field. So the spin g-factor is about 2, and the Bohr magneton is μ_B. So the energy would be H = g_s μ_B B m_s, where m_s can be ±1/2.

Wait, but the problem mentions orbital magnetic quantum number m. So perhaps it's the orbital contribution. The orbital contribution would have a different magnetic moment. The orbital magnetic moment is given by μ_L = (eħ/(2m_e)) * L, and L_z = m ħ. So for orbital Zeeman effect, the energy shift is E = (μ_0/(4π)) * (e^2 ħ)/(4 m_e^2 c^2) * m B. 

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the fine structure. The fine structure splitting in hydrogen is on the order of 10^-4 eV or so. The Zeeman splitting is usually smaller than that, but for higher m, it can be larger. But in this case, since m is small, it might be negligible compared to the transition energy. 

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is given with wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. Let's compute ΔE from that. The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and c is about 3x10^8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. 

Calculating E: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 4.089e-19 J. To convert to eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 4.089e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. 

Wait, but wait. 0.4861 μm is in the visible range, corresponding to the Balmer series. The energy for the Balmer-alpha line (n=2 to n=1) is about 10.2 eV? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²). For Balmer-alpha, n1=1, n2=2. R is about 1.097e4 m^-1. So 1/λ = 1.097e4 (1 - 1/4) = 1.097e4 * 3/4 ≈ 8.23e3 m^-1. So λ ≈ 1/(8.23e3) ≈ 1.215e-4 meters, which is about 121.5 nm. Wait, that doesn't match 0.4861 μm. Oh wait, 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm, which is the Balmer-beta line (n=2 to n=4). Wait, no, let me check the wavelengths. The Balmer series is for transitions ending at n=2. The lines are: n=3 to n=2 (λ=656 nm), n=4 to n=2 (λ=486 nm), n=5 to n=2 (λ=434 nm), etc. So the 486 nm is the n=4 to n=2 transition. The energy for this transition would give ΔE as the difference in energy between n=4 and n=2. 

The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. For n=4, E = -13.6 /16 = -0.85 eV. So the energy difference ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV. 

So the transition energy ΔE is 2.55 eV. Now, what about the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the Zeeman shift in this case? 

The Zeeman shift is given by ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m. Here, m is the magnetic quantum number. Since m is small, let's say m=0. Wait, but if m=0, the shift is zero. Maybe m=1? Or perhaps m is the orbital quantum number, which can be up to l. But for hydrogen, in the ground state, l=0, so m=0. For higher states, say n=2, l can be 0 or 1, so m=0, ±1. 

So let's take m=1. Then ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m. μ_B is about 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. m=1, so ΔE_zeeman = 9.274e-24 J. Converting to eV: 9.274e-24 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. 

Wait, that's 5.79e-5 eV. So compared to ΔE of about 2.55 eV, the Zeeman term is much smaller. So the paramagnetic coupling term is way less than the transition energy. 

But wait, wait. The question says 'paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom'. So the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman term, and the transition energy is 2.55 eV. So the question is which is bigger? 

The Zeeman term is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much smaller than ΔE which is 2.55 eV. So the Zeeman term is much smaller than the transition energy. 

Therefore, the expectation value of H (the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE. So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term (Zeeman effect) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy ΔE**:  
   The transition energy ΔE is calculated using the wavelength \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m}\), which corresponds to the Balmer-beta line (\(n=4 \to n=2\)) in the hydrogen atom spectrum. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by \(E_n = -\frac{13.6 \, \text{eV}}{n^2}\).  
   - For \(n=2\), \(E_2 = -3.4 \, \text{eV}\).  
   - For \(n=4\), \(E_4 = -0.85 \, \text{eV}\).  
   - The transition energy is \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_4 = -3.4 - (-0.85) = -2.55 \, \text{eV}\).  
   Thus, \(\Delta E = 2.55 \, \text{eV}\) in magnitude.

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term (Zeeman Effect)**:  
   The Zeeman energy shift is given by \(\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m\), where:  
   - \(\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\) is the Bohr magneton.  
   - \(B = 1 \, \text{T}\) is the magnetic field strength.  
   - \(m\) is the magnetic quantum number.  

   Since \(m\) is small (e.g., \(m = 1\)), the Zeeman shift is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \cdot 1 \, \text{T} \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \(\Delta E = 2.55 \, \text{eV}\) is much larger than the Zeeman term \(\Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}\). Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is negligible compared to the transition energy.

**Conclusion**: The expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy \(\Delta E\). Therefore, the correct option is:
