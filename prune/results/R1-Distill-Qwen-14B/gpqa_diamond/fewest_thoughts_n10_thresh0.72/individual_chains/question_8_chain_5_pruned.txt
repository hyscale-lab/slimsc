Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The setup is that they're studying white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and also some double mutants. The idea is to see which genes are involved in the resistance and how they interact.

The results show the resistance levels of each mutant. Let me note down the data:

- Wild-type (control) has 100% resistance.
- g1: 75% resistance
- g2: 0% resistance
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% resistance
- g2g3: 0% resistance
- g1g2: 0% resistance

Hmm, so when a plant can't make a certain gene product (because it's knocked out), it has lower resistance. For example, g2 completely loses resistance.

The question mentions that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So maybe one gene is regulating the others.

The options are about gene interactions: which gene is a transcription factor, whether they show pleiotropy or gene redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of B depends on A.

Also, pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this case, I think it's more about the gene interactions in the pathway.

Let me think about each part.

First, the single mutants:

- g2 has 0% resistance. So knocking out G2 completely eliminates resistance. That suggests that G2 is critical for resistance. Maybe it's a transcription factor because it's upstream, so without it, none of the downstream genes are expressed, so no resistance.

G1 knockout has 75% resistance. So the plant is less resistant but not completely. That implies that without G1, some resistance remains. Maybe G1 is not the only way the plant can resist the disease.

G3 knockout has 50% resistance. So even without G3, they have half the resistance of wild-type. So G3 contributes to resistance, but it's not the only factor.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as just knocking out G2. So G1's function is perhaps redundant in the presence of G2? Or maybe G2 is downstream of G1. Wait, if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then G1 could be another gene that G2 activates. So if both are knocked out, the effect is the same as knocking out G2 alone.

g1g3: 10% resistance. Which is even lower than either single mutant. So their combined effect is worse than each alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, and when both are knocked out, there's almost no resistance. 

g2g3: 0% resistance. So without G2, even if G3 is present, resistance is gone. That makes sense because if G2 is a transcription factor, then G3 might be downstream of it. So without G2, G3 can't function because G2 is upstream.

Wait, but in the single G3 mutant, it's 50% resistance. So G3 alone contributes half. That suggests that without G2, G3 can't do much. Which fits with G2 being upstream.

Putting it together:

- G2 is the transcription factor because knocking it out wipes out all resistance. So G2 is necessary for the resistance pathway.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% â†’ same as g2. So G1's presence doesn't matter in the absence of G2. So perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, but it's not required when G2 is absent? Or maybe G1 is part of a parallel pathway that only contributes when G2 is present.

Wait, let me think about gene redundancy. If two genes can compensate for each other, knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone. But in our case, g1g2 is 0% resistance. But g2 alone is 0%, so adding g1 doesn't change anything. That suggests that G1's role is perhaps redundant when G2 is present. Or maybe G1 is part of a parallel pathway that doesn't contribute when G2 is absent.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. So when G2 is absent, G1 can't function, so knocking out G1 or G2 alone has similar effects, but in the double mutant, it's the same as either.

Wait, but in the single mutants:

g1 is 75% resistance. So when G1 is knocked out, the plant is still 75% resistant. So G1 is not required for 100% resistance, but contributes to 25% of it. Because without G1, they lose 25% of resistance (from 100 to 75).

Similarly, without G3, they lose 50% (100 to 50). So G3 is more critical than G1.

In the double mutant g1g3, they have 10% resistance. So losing both G1 and G3 brings it down to 10%, which is even
