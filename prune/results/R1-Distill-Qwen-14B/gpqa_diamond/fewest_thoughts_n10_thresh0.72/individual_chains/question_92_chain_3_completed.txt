Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the enthalpy of formation of this molecule. The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a bit complex. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, the question gives me bond energies instead of formation values. Oh right, I think I can calculate it using bond energies.

So, the formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation is calculated by subtracting the total bond energies of the reactants from the products. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think it's the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken minus the bonds formed. But wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula is ΔH°f = Σ (bonds broken) - Σ (bonds formed). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, when bonds are broken, that requires energy input, so the bonds broken are subtracted. Hmm, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the enthalpy change being the sum of the bond energies of the products' bonds minus the reactants' bonds, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, another approach. The standard method is to calculate the enthalpy change by considering the energy required to break bonds (which is endothermic) and the energy released when forming new bonds (exothermic). So, the total enthalpy change would be the sum of the energies of the bonds broken minus the sum of the energies of the bonds formed. Because breaking bonds requires energy (so you add that), and forming bonds releases energy (so you subtract that).

But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me get this straight. The bond dissociation energy is the energy needed to break a bond. So, if you're breaking bonds in the reactants, you need to add those energies. Then, when you form new bonds in the products, you release energy, so you subtract the sum of the bond energies of the products' bonds.

So, the formula is: ΔH = (Σ bond energies of reactants broken) - (Σ bond energies of products formed). But wait, wait, no, because the products are new molecules, so for the reaction, you have reactants → products. So, the bonds in the reactants are broken (so you add their energies), and the bonds in the products are formed (so you subtract their energies). So, yes, that formula holds.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the enthalpy of formation of the molecule. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for example, forming the molecule from carbon and hydrogen.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the enthalpy using the atomization method. The standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. The formula for that is:

ΔHf° = (Σ bond energies of reactants) - (Σ bond energies of products)

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Oh wait, alternatively, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken in the reactants and the bonds formed in the products. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formation of the molecule from its elements. Let's model it.

The molecule is made up of carbon and hydrogen. So, when it's formed from its elements, we can consider the bonds made and broken.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the enthalpy of formation as the difference between the bond energies of the products and the reactants. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the general approach.

Each molecule's enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the bonds in the molecule. The formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (number of each bond type × bond energy for reactants)] - [Σ (number of each bond type × bond energy for products)]

Wait, no, perhaps the other way around. Wait, no, in the reaction where elements are combined to form the molecule, the bonds in the reactants (elements) are broken, and the bonds in the products (the molecule) are formed.

Wait, so for example, for a molecule like CH4, the reaction is:

C(graphite) + 2 H2 → CH4

The bonds broken are the C-C bonds in graphite (but wait, graphite is already a form of carbon; actually, in this case, the bonds broken would be the H-H bonds in H2, and the C (as in, the C is in solid form, so maybe it's considered as individual atoms? Or perhaps the enthalpy of formation involves breaking the elemental bonds into atoms, then forming the molecule's bonds.

Wait, maybe it's better to think that the standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

So, the process is:

Elements (in standard states) → Atoms (by breaking their bonds) → Molecule (by forming new bonds).

So, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the bond energies required to break the bonds in the elements, minus the sum of the bond energies released when forming the molecule's bonds.

Wait, no, wait. Because breaking bonds requires energy, which is endothermic, so that would be positive. Forming bonds releases energy, so that's exothermic, negative. So the overall enthalpy change would be the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken (reactants) minus the bond energies of the bonds formed (products).

Wait, so the formula is: ΔHf° = [Σ (bonds broken in reactants)] - [Σ (bonds formed in products)]

But wait, in the formation reaction, the bonds broken are in the reactants (the elements), and the bonds formed are in the products (the molecule). So, for each bond in the reactants that is broken, you add its bond energy, and for each bond in the products that is formed, you subtract its bond energy.

So, the calculation would be: sum of bond energies of reactant bonds broken (H-H and C-C) minus sum of bond energies of product bonds formed (all the C-C, C=C, C-H bonds in the molecule).

Wait, but the reactants for the formation would be the elements: graphite (C) and H2. So, the bonds to break are C-C in graphite and H-H in H2. But wait, in the standard state, carbon is graphite, which has C-C bonds. Breaking those would require energy. Hydrogen is H2, so breaking H-H bonds would also require energy. Then, in the product, the molecule, various bonds are formed: C-C, C=C, C-H.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the total bonds in the molecule. Let's count the number of C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds.

First, let's figure out the structure. The molecule has the formula C12H20, because each (CH3)2 group is (CH3)2C- which is part of a longer chain.

Wait, let me count the carbons and hydrogens.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3)2C= is a part, then CH-, CH2-, CH(CH3)-, CH2-, CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the structure as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, for each double bond, there's a C=C.

Now, let's count all the bonds:

Each C in the molecule can be connected to other Cs or Hs.

But maybe a better approach is to count the number of each type of bond.

Let's think about the molecule:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes two C-H bonds per CH3. Wait, each CH3 has three C-H bonds, and there are two such groups. So for each (CH3)2 part, 6 C-H bonds.

But wait, in the molecule, there are two such (CH3)2 groups on each end.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by drawing the structure step by step.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH=C(CH3)2.

So, there are two double bonds: one between the first and second C, and another between the sixth and seventh C (assuming each C is numbered sequentially).

Each double bond is a C=C.

So, let's list all the types of bonds:

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H bonds. Let's see how many CH3 groups are in the molecule.

Looking at the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH: this part has two CH3 groups attached to the C which is double-bonded to another C.
- Then CH2- which is a single C connected to two Hs.
- Then CH(CH3): this has one CH3 group attached.
- Next is another CH2.
- Then CH=C(CH3)2: this has two CH3 groups attached to the double-bonded C.

So, the total number of CH3 groups is 2 (first part) + 1 (third part) + 2 (last part) = 5 CH3 groups. Wait, no, wait. Let me recount:

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH: two CH3 groups attached to the C that's double-bonded.

Then, after that double bond, CH- (so that's a CH group, connected to CH2, etc.).

Then, the next groups: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The CH(CH3) group has one CH3.

The CH=C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups.

So, the CH3 groups are:

- Two in the first (CH3)2C=CH.
- One in the CH(CH3).
- Two in the C(CH3)2.

Total: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 CH3 groups.

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds, so 5 × 3 = 15 C-H bonds.

But wait, let's not forget the other C-H bonds.

Looking at the structure:

- The part after the first double bond is CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, CH- group: that's a C connected to one H and two other Cs. So, how many C-H bonds here? One C-H.

Then, CH2 groups: each CH2 has two C-H bonds. Let's find how many CH2 groups in the structure.

Looking at the molecule:

After the first double bond:

CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH- is one C connected to H, then CH2, etc. So the CH2 groups are between the CH and CH(CH3), another between CH(CH3) and CH2, and another between CH2 and CH=C.

So, that's three CH2 groups: each contributes 2 C-H bonds.

So, three × 2 = 6 C-H bonds.

Plus the CH- groups: the first CH after the double bond has one C-H, and the last CH (before the double bond) has one C-H.

Wait, let me re-express the structure.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C=C(CH3)2.

Wait, maybe I got the structure slightly wrong. Let me count each C and H:

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just count all the C-H bonds in the molecule.

Wait, every single C that is not part of a double bond and not connected to another C is connected to Hs. Let me count the number of C-H bonds.

The molecule has:

Each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H. So, as earlier, 5 CH3 groups: 5 × 3 = 15.

Then, the other C's:

- The first C in (CH3)2C= is bonded to two CH3 groups and a double bond. So, no C-H bonds.

- The second C in the first double bond (C=CH-) is bonded to the first C (double bond), two CH3 groups, and another C (from CH-). So, no C-H.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-, meaning the C of the double bond is connected to two CH3 groups and the other end is connected to a CH group.

So the structure is:

(CH3)2-C(=CH-...) - other parts.

So, the C in =CH- is connected to another C (the one from the double bond) and two Hs.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each C's bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should count all the single bonds and double bonds.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, I should calculate the total number of each type of bond in the molecule and plug into the formula.

So, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The formula can be written as C12H20, because each (CH3)2C= is a part, and so on.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH contributes 4 carbons (two CH3, one C, one CH), then the rest:

CH2 is one C, then CH(CH3) is another, CH2 another, CH=C(CH3)2 is another.

Wait, no, perhaps I should count the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C=CH is 3 carbons (two CH3, one C, and the double bond to another C). Then the next parts: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

That's 4 more carbons: CH2 (C), CH(CH3) (C), CH2 (C), CH=C(CH3)2 (C), and then the two CH3 groups on that C.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the entire molecule as a chain.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of each bond type.

Let me proceed step by step.

1. Count the number of C-C bonds.

2. Count the number of C=C bonds.

3. Count the number of C-H bonds.

Then, calculate the total energy for breaking the bonds in the reactants (elements) and forming the bonds in the products (the molecule).

Wait, but the reactants are the elements in their standard states: carbon (graphite) and hydrogen (H2).

So, the bonds broken in the reactants are:

- C-C bonds in graphite.

- H-H bonds in H2.

The bonds formed in the products are:

- All the bonds in the molecule: C-C, C=C, and C-H.

Wait, but how do I calculate the number of each bond type?

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total number of each bond type in the molecule, then plug into the formula.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure, so maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization method. The formula is:

ΔHf° = Σ (bond energies of bonds broken) - Σ (bond energies of bonds formed)

Wait, but in this case, the bonds broken are in the reactants (elements) and the bonds formed are in the products (molecule).

So, for the formation reaction:

C (graphite) + H2 → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The bonds broken are C-C in graphite and H-H in H2.

The bonds formed are all the bonds in the molecule: C-C, C=C, and C-H.

Wait, but how many of each bond type are there in the molecule?

Well, let me think.

Each molecule has:

- Number of C=C bonds: 2 (since there are two double bonds in the structure).

- Number of C-C single bonds: Let's count.

Looking at the structure:

Each (CH3)2C=CH contributes a C connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another C.

Then, the next part is CH2, which is connected to another CH2, which is connected to CH(CH3), then another CH2, then CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each C in the chain is connected to the next via single bonds, except for the two double bonds.

So, the number of C-C single bonds would be (number of single bonds in the chain) plus any in the branches.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the total number of C-C bonds.

The molecule has 12 carbons, but some are connected via double bonds.

The molecule has 2 double bonds (C=C). Each double bond is two C-C bonds (but in double bonds, each is a sigma bond). So, for each C=C, there's one C-C bond (since double bonds are one sigma and one pi; but bond energy is given as a single value, so perhaps each C=C bond counts as one bond with energy 300 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the given bond energies are:

C-C: 200 kJ/mol

C=C: 300 kJ/mol

C-H: 400 kJ/mol

H-H: 100 kJ/mol

Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, what's that about?

Ah, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of carbon (graphite) into isolated atoms. So, for graphite, each C is bonded to three others in a hexagonal lattice. But the exact value isn't given; instead, I think the question expects us to use the given values to find the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. So, perhaps for each C-C bond in graphite, the bond energy is 1000 kJ/mol divided by the number of bonds per mole of carbon.

Wait, each mole of graphite has 1.5 moles of C-C bonds per mole. Because each C has three bonds, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So, per mole, it's (3/2) moles of C-C bonds.

So, the bond energy per C-C bond in graphite would be 1000 kJ/mol (atomization energy) divided by (3/2) moles per mole of C.

So, 1000 / (3/2) = 1000 * (2/3) ≈ 666.67 kJ/mol per C-C bond.

Wait, but the problem gives us a bond energy for C-C as 200 kJ/mol. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Maybe I'm misunderstanding this part.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, and the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all C-C bonds in the molecule into C atoms. So, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the sum of the bond energies of all the C-C bonds in the molecule.

Wait, no, the enthalpy of atomization (or enthalpy of complete dissociation) is the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of a substance into individual atoms. For carbon, that's the energy to break all C-C bonds into C atoms.

But the problem gives the bond energy of C-C as 200 kJ/mol. So perhaps each C-C bond is 200 kJ/mol. But that's confusing because in reality, the C-C bond energy is about 193 kJ/mol, but here it's given as 200.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires me to use the given bond energies regardless of real values.

So, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, I can proceed as follows:

The formation reaction is:

12 C (graphite) + 20/2 H2 → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, because the formula is C12H20.

So, 12 moles of C and 20/2 = 10 moles of H2.

So, bonds broken in reactants:

- C-C bonds in 12 moles of graphite.

- H-H bonds in 10 moles of H2.

Bonds formed in the product:

- All C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

So, first, calculate the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Let me try to count:

1. C-C bonds: Each single bond between two carbons.

2. C=C bonds: There are two double bonds in the molecule.

3. C-H bonds: Each single bond between C and H.

But how many of each?

Let me try to count:

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let's break it down into sections.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-

   - This part has three carbons: two CH3 and one C connected via double bond to another C.
   - The C=C is a double bond, which counts as one bond with energy 300 kJ/mol.

   So, in this part:

   - Number of C-C bonds: Each CH3 group has a C connected to the central C. So, two C-C bonds (from each CH3 to the central C).
   - Wait, but the central C is connected to the double bond as well.

   Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each C=C is a single bond for this purpose, so each double bond contributes one bond with energy 300 kJ/mol.

   So, in the first part, (CH3)2C=CH-:

   - The central C is connected to two CH3 groups (so two C-C bonds) and a double bond to the next C (so one C=C bond).

   Then, the next C (from the double bond) is connected to a CH group (so one C-C bond to the CH group).

   So, in this part, the C-C bonds are:

   - Two from CH3 groups → central C.

   - One from central C → next C (the double bond is C=C, so that's a separate count).

   Wait, but perhaps I should think of each section separately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that in the entire molecule, the number of C-C single bonds is:

Each single bond between two carbons. Let's count each.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking at the carbon chain:

C1: (CH3)2C=
C2: =CH-
C3: CH2
C4: CH(CH3)
C5: CH2
C6: CH=
C7: C(CH3)2

Wait, perhaps that's seven carbons in the main chain, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is longer. Maybe I should count the number of C-C single bonds.

Wait, perhaps each single bond between two Cs is a C-C bond.

So, in the structure, each single bond between two adjacent Cs in the chain is a C-C bond.

Let me count the number of single C-C bonds:

- Between C1 and C2 (double bond: C=C → not counted as a C-C single bond.

Wait, no, wait: C1 is (CH3)2C, and C2 is CH-.

So, C1 and C2 are connected via a double bond (C=C), so that's not a C-C single bond.

Then, C2 is connected to C3 via a single bond: that's one C-C bond.

C3 is connected to C4 via a single bond: another.

C4 is connected to C5 via a single bond: another.

C5 is connected to C6 via a single bond: another.

C6 is connected to C7 via a double bond: C=C, so that's a C=C bond.

So, in the main chain, we have four C-C single bonds.

Additionally, we have branches:

- C1 has two CH3 groups (so two C-C bonds from C1 to each CH3).

- C4 has a CH3 group attached (so one C-C bond from C4 to CH3).

- C7 has two CH3 groups attached (so two C-C bonds from C7 to each CH3).

Wait, but each CH3 group is a branch. So, the C-C bonds in the branches are:

- For C1: two C-C bonds (each CH3 is connected to C1).

- For C4: one C-C bond (the CH(CH3) group).

- For C7: two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to C7).

So, total C-C bonds from branches: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

Plus the C-C bonds in the main chain: 4.

So, total C-C single bonds: 4 + 5 = 9.

Wait, but earlier I thought the main chain has four C-C single bonds. Let me recount.

Main chain:

C1 (from (CH3)2C) is connected via double bond to C2.

Then, C2 is connected to C3 via a single bond.

C3 to C4: single.

C4 to C5: single.

C5 to C6: single.

C6 is connected via double bond to C7.

So, between C2 and C3: single → 1.

C3-C4: 2.

C4-C5:3.

C5-C6:4.

So, four single C-C bonds in the main chain.

Branches:

C1 has two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

C4 has one CH3 → one C-C bond.

C7 has two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

Total C-C bonds: 4 (chain) + 2 +1 +2 = 9.

So, 9 C-C single bonds.

Number of C=C bonds: two (the two double bonds in the structure).

Number of C-H bonds: each CH3 group has three C-H bonds.

How many CH3 groups are there?

Looking at the structure:

- C1 has two CH3 groups.

- C4 has one CH3 group.

- C7 has two CH3 groups.

So, 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 CH3 groups.

Each CH3 has 3 C-H bonds → 5 ×3 =15.

But wait, are there any other C-H bonds?

In the main chain:

C2 (from =CH-) has one C-H bond.

C3 (CH2 group) has two C-H bonds.

C5 (CH2 group) has two.

C6 (from CH=) has one C-H bond.

Wait, let me count:

C2: =CH- → one C-H.

C3: CH2 → two C-H.

C5: CH2 → two.

C6: CH= → one C-H.

So, 1 +2 +2 +1 =6.

So, total C-H bonds: 15 (from CH3) +6 (from other Cs) =21.

Wait, but the molecule's formula is C12H20. So, 20 H atoms in total. Each C-H bond contributes one H atom, so 21 C-H bonds would imply 21 H atoms, but the formula has 20. Hmm, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake in counting.

Wait, let me recount the C-H bonds again.

Each CH3 group: 5 groups ×3 =15.

Now, the other C-H bonds:

Looking at the structure:

- The =CH- part has one C-H.

- The CH2 groups:

   - There are three CH2 groups in the main chain: wait, how many?

In the structure, after the first double bond, it's CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH=C(...).

Wait, I think I have three CH2 groups:

C2: CH-

C3: CH2

C4: CH(CH3)

C5: CH2

C6: CH-

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the CH2 groups.

Let me model the structure as:

C1: (CH3)2C=CH-

C2: CH-

C3: CH2-

C4: CH(CH3)-

C5: CH2-

C6: CH-

C7: C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure has the following connections:

C1=C2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C7=C8.

Wait, perhaps I should model the structure as:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure has two double bonds, each between a pair of carbons.

So, in this case, perhaps the main chain is longer.

But regardless, perhaps I should recount the C-H bonds.

Each CH3: 5 ×3 =15.

Now, let's look at other C-H bonds:

- C2 (from =CH-): one C-H.

- C3 (CH2): two.

- C5 (CH2): two.

- C6 (from CH=): one.

That's 1+2+2+1=6.

So, total C-H bonds:15+6=21.

But the formula is C12H20. So 20 H atoms.

Hmm, 21 C-H bonds would imply 21 H atoms, but the formula says 20. So, I must have overcounted.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the CH3 groups.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the CH3 groups are:

- Two from (CH3)2C=.

- One from CH(CH3).

- Two from C(CH3)2.

That's a total of 5 CH3 groups, which is correct.

Wait, but perhaps in the C=C(CH3)2 part, each CH3 is attached to the same C, so that's two CH3 groups. So, correct.

Now, the other C-H bonds:

- The =CH- has one C-H.

- Each CH2 group (three of them) has two each. Wait, how many CH2 groups are there?

After the first double bond, the structure is:

=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-C=C(...).

So, the CH2 groups are:

- CH2 between =CH- and CH(CH3).

- CH2 between CH(CH3) and CH2.

- CH2 between CH2 and C=C.

Wait, that's three CH2 groups, each contributing two C-H bonds → 3×2=6.

But wait, the last CH2 is between CH2 and C=C. So, perhaps it's a single CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I should list each C and their H's.

Let me imagine the molecule as a chain:

C1: (CH3)2C= 

C2: =CH-

C3: CH2

C4: CH(CH3)

C5: CH2

C6: CH2

C7: CH=C

C8: C(CH3)2.

So, in this case:

C1: (CH3)2 → two CH3 groups, so 3×2=6 H.

C2: =CH- → one H.

C3: CH2 → two H.

C4: CH(CH3) → one H (because CH(CH3) has one H attached to C4, and three from CH3).

Wait, no, wait: the CH(CH3) group is a C connected to three Hs and one CH3? No, wait, CH(CH3) would have two Hs attached, because the structure is CH(CH3).

Wait, no, CH(CH3) would have two H's: the central C is connected to one H, one CH3, and two other Cs (the previous and next in the chain).

Wait, no, perhaps I need to clarify. The group is CH(CH3), so the C has three bonds: one to the previous C, one to the next C, and one to a CH3. So, the structure is CH(CH3)-, which would have one H attached. Because CH2-CH(CH3)- would have the CH(CH3) having one H.

Wait, but wait, the formula is CH(CH3), which is CH2 with one H replaced by CH3? No, CH(CH3) has two Hs attached to the C: no. Wait, a CH2 group has two Hs, but when it's CH(CH3), it's a CH2 group where one H is replaced by a CH3. So, the number of Hs on that C would be two (since it's CH(CH3)).

Wait, no, no. Let me think: CH2 is CH2-, which has two Hs. CH(CH3) would have one H, because it's CH(CH3). So, the structure is:

- C connected to two other C's (previous and next in chain), one CH3 group, and one H.

So, that C has one H attached.

So, for C4 (CH(CH3)), it has one H.

Now, listing each C:

C1: (CH3)2C= → two CH3 groups. Each CH3 has 3 Hs, so 2×3=6 H.

C2: =CH- → one H.

C3: CH2 → two H.

C4: CH(CH3) → one H (since it's CH(CH3)).

C5: CH2 → two H.

C6: CH2 → two H.

C7: CH= → one H.

C8: C(CH3)2 → no H attached (since all bonds are taken by CH3 groups and the double bond).

Wait, but C8 is part of a double bond, so in C=C. So, perhaps C8 is part of the double bond, and the C=C is C7 and C8.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

C1: (CH3)2C= 

C2: C=CH-

C3: CH2-

C4: CH(CH3)-

C5: CH2-

C6: CH2-

C7: CH=C-

C8: C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps C7 and C8 are the two ends of the second double bond.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Maybe it's better to proceed with the counts I have.

So, with that, the H count from C1 is 6, C2:1, C3:2, C4:1, C5:2, C6:2, C7:1, and C8:0.

Total H so far: 6+1+2+1+2+2+1=15.

But the formula is C12H20. So, 20 H atoms, but I'm only accounting for 15. So, I must have missed some.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-H bonds. Let me try a different approach.

Each C in the molecule can have a certain number of Hs.

Another approach: The formula is C12H20.

So, 12 C and 20 H.

Each C can have valence of 4 (since carbon has 4 valence electrons).

So, the total valence bonds for C is 12 ×4 =48.

Each C-H bond contributes one to C's valence. Each C-C bond contributes two (since each bond is shared between two Cs). Each C=C contributes two (since double bond).

So, let's compute the total valence.

Let me denote:

n(C-C) = number of C-C single bonds.

n(C=C) = number of C=C bonds.

n(C-H) = number of C-H bonds.

Each C-C bond contributes 2 to the total valence (since each bond is between two C's).

Each C=C bond contributes 2 (since it's a double bond, but each bond is a single unit for valence purposes).

Each C-H bond contributes 1.

So, total valence from C: 2 ×n(C-C) + 2 ×n(C=C) + 1 ×n(C-H) = 48.

Because each C must have four bonds.

So, 2n(C-C) + 2n(C=C) + n(C-H) =48.

We have n(C=C) =2 (two double bonds).

So, 2n(C-C) + 4 + n(C-H) =48 → 2n(C-C) + n(C-H) =44.

But we also know the total number of H atoms is 20, so n(C-H) =20.

Wait, no. Because each C-H bond contributes one H, so n(C-H) =20.

Wait, no. Because each H is in a C-H bond, so n(C-H) =20.

So, substituting:

2n(C-C) +20 =44 → 2n(C-C)=24 → n(C-C)=12.

So, there are 12 C-C single bonds.

Earlier, I thought 9 C-C bonds, but according to this, it's 12. So I must have miscounted earlier.

So, the correct number of C-C single bonds is 12.

So, n(C-C)=12.

n(C=C)=2.

n(C-H)=20.

So, the molecule has 12 C-C single bonds, 2 C=C bonds, and 20 C-H bonds.

Thus, the bonds formed in the product are:

12 C-C (each 200 kJ/mol) → 12 ×200 =2400 kJ.

2 C=C (each 300 kJ/mol) → 2 ×300=600 kJ.

20 C-H (each 400 kJ/mol) → 20 ×400=8000 kJ.

Wait, but wait, are these bond energies being subtracted or added?

Wait, in the formula for enthalpy of formation, the bonds broken in the reactants are subtracted by the bonds formed in the products.

Wait, no, the formula is: ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products).

Wait, no, I think I had it right earlier: bonds broken in reactants are subtracted from bonds formed in products.

Wait, no, the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactants broken) - (sum of bond energies of products formed).

Wait, no, because when you break bonds, you put energy in (endothermic), and when you form bonds, you release energy (exothermic).

So, for the reaction, the enthalpy change is (energy required to break reactant bonds) minus (energy released when forming product bonds).

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (reactant bonds × bond energy)] - [Σ (product bonds × bond energy)].

But wait, in the formation reaction, the reactants are the elements: C in graphite and H2.

The bonds broken in the reactants are C-C (in graphite) and H-H (in H2).

The bonds formed in the products are the bonds in the molecule: C-C, C=C, and C-H.

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C-C * bond energy C-C) + (n_H-H * bond energy H-H) ) ] - [ (n_C-C * bond energy C-C) + (n_C=C * bond energy C=C) + (n_C-H * bond energy C-H) ) ]

Wait, but wait. Because the bonds broken in the reactants are the C-C in graphite and H-H in H2.

The bonds formed in the products are the C-C, C=C, and C-H in the molecule.

So, the calculation is: [ (C-C bonds broken) + (H-H bonds broken) ] - [ (C-C bonds formed) + (C=C bonds formed) + (C-H bonds formed) ].

But wait, the bond energies given for C-C is 200 kJ/mol, but earlier I thought that the bond energy for C-C in graphite is higher because the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization as 1000 kJ/mol.

Wait, this is where I'm getting stuck. The problem gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. How does this relate to the C-C bond energy?

Ah, the enthalpy of atomization (ΔA°) is the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of carbon into individual atoms. For graphite, which has each C bonded to three others, the number of C-C bonds per mole is (3/2) moles (since each bond is shared between two C atoms).

So, the bond energy per C-C bond in graphite is ΔA° / (number of bonds per mole).

ΔA° = 1000 kJ/mol.

Number of C-C bonds per mole of C: 3/2.

So, bond energy per C-C bond: 1000 / (3/2) = 666.67 kJ/mol.

But the problem also gives a bond energy for C-C as 200 kJ/mol. Hmm, that's confusing. So, do I use 200 kJ/mol for C-C bonds in the molecule, and 666.67 kJ/mol for C-C bonds in graphite?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the enthalpy of atomization and use the given bond energies directly. Because the problem statement includes the bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. So, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is a red herring, or perhaps it's meant to be used to calculate the bond energy of C in graphite.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the given bond energies, assuming that the C-C bond energy in graphite is 200 kJ/mol and the C=C is 300 kJ/mol, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed using the given bond energies without considering the enthalpy of atomization. But that doesn't make sense because the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization, so it must be used.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to proceed step by step.

The reaction is:

12 C (graphite) + 10 H2 → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The bonds to break are:

- C-C bonds in 12 moles of graphite.

- H-H bonds in 10 moles of H2.

The bonds to form are:

- 12 C-C bonds (single bonds) in the molecule.

- 2 C=C bonds in the molecule.

- 20 C-H bonds in the molecule.

So, the calculation is:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C-C bonds in graphite × bond energy C-C) + (number of H-H bonds × bond energy H-H) ] - [ (number of C-C bonds in molecule × bond energy C-C) + (number of C=C bonds × bond energy C=C) + (number of C-H bonds × bond energy C-H) ]

But the problem is that the bond energy of C-C in graphite is different from the C-C in the molecule.

Given that the enthalpy of atomization (ΔA°) of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. For graphite, each mole of C has 3/2 moles of C-C bonds.

So, bond energy per C-C bond in graphite = 1000 kJ/mol / (3/2) = 666.67 kJ/mol.

But in the molecule, the C-C bond energy is given as 200 kJ/mol.

So, when calculating the bonds broken and formed, I need to use the appropriate bond energies.

So, for the C-C bonds in the reactant (graphite), each bond has energy 666.67 kJ/mol.

For the C-C bonds in the product (molecule), each has energy 200 kJ/mol.

Similarly, for the H-H bonds in H2, each has energy 100 kJ/mol.

C=C bonds in the molecule: 300 kJ/mol.

C-H bonds: 400 kJ/mol.

So, now I can plug in the numbers.

Number of C-C bonds in reactant (graphite): 12 moles of C × (3/2) bonds per mole =18 moles of C-C bonds.

So, energy to break C-C bonds: 18 ×666.67 ≈ 11999.99 ≈12,000 kJ.

Number of H-H bonds: 10 moles, each with 1 bond → 10 ×100 = 1000 kJ.

So, total energy to break bonds in reactants: 12,000 + 1000 =13,000 kJ.

Now, bonds formed in product:

- 12 C-C bonds: 12 ×200 =2400 kJ.

- 2 C=C bonds: 2 ×300=600 kJ.

- 20 C-H bonds:20 ×400=8000 kJ.

Total bonds formed energy: 2400 +600 +8000=11,000 kJ.

So, the enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = (13,000) - (11,000) = 2,000 kJ/mol.

Wait, but none of the options match that. The options are A) 11200, B)67.4, C)11.44, D)1900.

Hmm, 2000 isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of bonds broken in the reactants.

Wait, the number of C-C bonds in 12 moles of graphite is 12 × (3/2) =18.

Each C-C bond has energy 666.67 kJ/mol → 18 ×666.67 ≈12,000 kJ.

H2: 10 moles → 10 ×1 bond → 10 ×100=1000 kJ.

Total reactant bonds broken: 12,000 +1000=13,000 kJ.

Bonds formed in product: 12 ×200=2400, 2 ×300=600, 20 ×400=8000 → 2400+600=3000; 3000+8000=11,000.

ΔHf° =13,000 -11,000=2,000 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have 2000. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I swapped the formula. Maybe it's the bonds formed minus bonds broken.

Wait, because when you form bonds, you release energy (exothermic), and breaking bonds requires energy (endothermic). So, the net enthalpy change would be bonds broken (endothermic) minus bonds formed (exothermic).

But wait, in the formula, the bonds broken are in the reactants, so you add their energy, and bonds formed are in the products, so you subtract their energy.

So, the formula is ΔHf° = sum(reactant bonds broken) - sum(product bonds formed).

In our case, sum(reactant)=13,000, sum(product)=11,000.

So, 13,000-11,000=2,000 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of bonds.

Wait, let me recount the C-H bonds. The formula is C12H20, which has 20 H atoms, all from C-H bonds.

So, n(C-H)=20.

So, the calculation for bonds formed is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is in grams, but the options are in kJ/mol or kJ/g.

Wait, the options are given in kJ/mol and kJ/g.

The question asks for the enthalpy of formation, which is typically in kJ/mol.

Looking back, the options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol

B) 67.4 kJ/mol

C) 11.44 kJ/g

D) 1900 kJ/g

So, my calculated answer is 2000 kJ/mol, but it's not an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the bond energies for the reactants as the given C-C and H-H, not the enthalpy of atomization.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be simpler. Perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is provided, but the given bond energies are to be used as the energy per bond.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the given bond energies, without considering the enthalpy of atomization.

Wait, but the problem statement says "given enthalpy of atomization of carbon=1000 kJ/mol."

Hmm.

Another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated as:

ΔHf° = (Σ bond energies of reactant bonds) - (Σ bond energies of product bonds)

Wait, but in this case, the reactant bonds are the bonds in the elements (C and H2), and product bonds are in the molecule.

So, for C (graphite), the bond energy per C-C is 1000 kJ/mol. But that's the enthalpy of atomization, which is the energy to break all bonds in one mole of C into atoms. So, each mole of C has (3/2) moles of C-C bonds.

So, bond energy per C-C bond in graphite is 1000 / (3/2) = 666.67 kJ/mol.

Similarly, for H2, bond energy is 100 kJ/mol per H-H bond.

So, for 12 moles of C, the number of C-C bonds is 12 × (3/2) =18.

Each C-C bond:666.67 → 18 ×666.67=12,000 kJ.

For H2:10 moles →10 ×100=1000 kJ.

Total bonds broken:13,000 kJ.

Bonds formed: as before, 12×200 + 2×300 +20×400 = 2400 +600 +8000=11,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf°=13,000 -11,000=2,000 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds in the product.

Wait, the product has 12 C-C single bonds, 2 C=C, so total C-C and C=C bonds would be 12 +2=14? Or no, because C=C is a different bond type.

Wait, the product's bonds are:

- 12 C-C (single) → 12 ×200=2400.

- 2 C=C →2×300=600.

- 20 C-H →20×400=8000.

Total:2400+600+8000=11,000.

So, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given bond energies without considering the enthalpy of atomization, but that can't be because the problem gives the enthalpy of atomization.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the enthalpy of formation of the molecule from carbon and hydrogen gas, but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the enthalpy change per mole of the molecule.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, another approach: using the given bond energies, the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C×ΔH_atomization) ) + (n_H2 × bond energy H-H) ] - [ n_C-C × bond energy C-C + n_C=C × bond energy C=C + n_C-H × bond energy C-H ]

But wait, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The enthalpy of formation is calculated by:

ΔHf° = (sum of atomization energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies of compound).

So, for the reaction:

12 C (graphite) + 20/2 H2 → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The sum of atomization energies is for 12 C and 10 H2.

But the atomization energy is given as 1000 kJ/mol for C. So, 12 ×1000 =12,000 kJ.

For H2, the bond energy is 100 kJ/mol. Each H2 molecule has one bond, so 10 ×100=1000 kJ.

Total atomization energy:12,000 +1000=13,000 kJ.

Now, the sum of bond energies in the molecule is:

n_C-C ×200 + n_C=C ×300 + n_C-H ×400.

Which is 12×200 +2×300 +20×400 =2400 +600 +8000=11,000 kJ.

So, ΔHf° =13,000 -11,000=2,000 kJ/mol.

Again, same result. No option matches.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for per gram, not per mole.

Wait, option C is 11.44 kJ/g, and D is 1900 kJ/g. So, perhaps I should compute per gram.

The molecular weight of the molecule is C12H20.

C has atomic weight ~12 g/mol, H ~1 g/mol.

So, molecular weight=12×12 +20×1=144 +20=164 g/mol.

So, 2000 kJ/mol → 2000 /164 ≈12.2 kJ/g.

But that's approximately 12.2 kJ/g, which isn't one of the options. The closest option is C) 11.44 kJ/g.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula.

Wait, the given molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Counting the carbons:

Each (CH3)2C= is 3 carbons.

Then, the CH- is one, CH2 is one, CH(CH3) is one, CH2 is one, CH=C(CH3)2 is two (the C and the two CH3 groups attached to it? Or does the C=C count as one.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C10H14.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps I should recount the carbons.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- is three carbons (two CH3 and one C connected via double bond).

Then, the rest:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

That's four more carbons (the CH2, CH(CH3), CH2, and CH=C(...)).

Wait, but the CH=C(CH3)2 is two carbons (the C in CH=C and the two CH3 groups attached to it as substituents. So, perhaps the total is 3 +4 +2=9? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C10H14.

Wait, but given the structure, perhaps the formula is actually C10H14.

Wait, (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Counting carbons:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 3 C.

- CH2:1.

- CH(CH3):1.

- CH2:1.

- CH=C(CH3)2:2 C (the double bonded C and the two CH3 groups attached to it).

Wait, but that would make 3+1+1+1+2=8 C, which doesn't add up. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting, and the formula is C12H20 as I thought earlier.

But if the molecular weight is 164 g/mol, then 2000 kJ/mol → 2000/164 ≈12.2 kJ/g. But option C is 11.44 kJ/g.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the molecular weight.

Wait, 12×12=144 for C, 20×1=20 for H. So 144+20=164 g/mol.

2000 kJ/mol → 2000 /164 ≈12.2 kJ/g.

But option C is 11.44, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of bonds.

Wait, perhaps I used 20 C-H bonds, but perhaps it's 19 or something else.

Wait, the formula is C12H20, so 20 H atoms. Each C-H bond is one H, so 20 C-H bonds.

So, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation per mole, not per molecule. Or perhaps I misapplied the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is supposed to be done using the bond energies without considering the enthalpy of atomization.

Wait, if I ignore the enthalpy of atomization, using only the given bond energies, perhaps the calculation would be:

ΔHf° = [ (n_C× bond energy C-C) + (n_H2 × bond energy H-H) ] - [ (n_C-C × bond energy C-C) + (n_C=C × bond energy C=C) + (n_C-H × bond energy C-H) ]

But wait, without knowing the number of C-C bonds in graphite, this approach doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different method, considering that the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants' bonds minus the products'.

Wait, perhaps the reactants are graphite and H2, and the products are the molecule.

But the bond energies for the reactants (graphite and H2) are given as C-C=200, H-H=100.

Wait, if I use those values, the calculation would be:

Number of C-C bonds in 12 moles of graphite: 12 × (3/2) =18 bonds.

Each bond: 200 kJ/mol → 18 ×200=3600 kJ.

Number of H-H bonds:10 ×1=10 bonds →10 ×100=1000 kJ.

Total reactant bonds broken:3600 +1000=4600 kJ.

Bonds formed in product:12×200 +2×300 +20×400=2400+600+8000=11,000 kJ.

ΔHf°=4600 -11,000 = -6400 kJ/mol.

But that's a negative value, and the options don't have that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the bond energies for C-C in graphite as 1000 kJ/mol (the enthalpy of atomization) but that doesn't make sense because that's the energy for all bonds, not per bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the given bond energies without considering the enthalpy of atomization.

In that case, the number of bonds to break in the reactants would be:

12 C atoms → each C in graphite has three C-C bonds, but as they are in a solid, perhaps each C contributes 1.5 bonds on average.

But without knowing the bond energy per C-C in graphite, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is much simpler, and I'm overcomplicating it.

Another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated as:

ΔHf° = (Σ bond energies of reactants broken) - (Σ bond energies of products formed).

The reactants are C (graphite) and H2.

The products are the molecule, which has:

n_C-C =12 →12×200=2400.

n_C=C=2 →2×300=600.

n_C-H=20 →20×400=8000.

Total products bonds:2400+600+8000=11,000.

The reactants have:

Each mole of C has 3/2 C-C bonds. 12 moles →18 bonds. Each C-C=200 →18×200=3600.

H2:10 moles →10 bonds. Each H-H=100 →10×100=1000.

Total reactant bonds broken:3600 +1000=4600.

ΔHf°=4600 -11,000= -6400 kJ/mol.

Negative, but the options don't have this.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, considering that the enthalpy of formation is calculated from the elements in their standard states, and the bonds in the molecule are the only ones considered.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

ΔHf° = ( (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization) + (number of H atoms × bond energy H-H /2) ) - ( sum of bond energies of the molecule's bonds )

Because each H atom in H2 contributes 0.5×100 kJ/mol.

So, let me try this approach.

Number of C atoms:12 →12 ×1000=12,000 kJ.

Number of H atoms:20 →20 × (100/2)=1000 kJ.

Total energy to break reactant bonds:12,000 +1000=13,000 kJ.

Bonds formed in product:12×200 + 2×300 +20×400=2400+600+8000=11,000 kJ.

ΔHf°=13,000 -11,000=2000 kJ/mol.

Again, same result as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the bond energies without considering the enthalpy of atomization, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be calculated without using the enthalpy of atomization, but using the given bond energies.

In that case, the reactants' bonds are:

Each C-C bond in graphite is considered to have bond energy 200 kJ/mol.

But that seems odd because the enthalpy of atomization is provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the correct answer is option B) 67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, the molecule has 12 C-C single bonds. Each contributes 200 kJ.

So, 12 ×200 =2400.

2 C=C bonds: 2 ×300=600.

20 C-H bonds:20 ×400=8000.

Sum:2400+600=3000; 3000+8000=11,000.

Reactants' bonds:

12 C atoms, each contributing 1.5 C-C bonds →18 bonds.

Each C-C:200 → 18 ×200=3600.

H2:10 moles →10 H-H bonds →10 ×100=1000.

Total reactant bonds:3600 +1000=4600.

ΔHf°=4600 -11,000= -6400.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of C-C bonds in the molecule as 10 instead of 12.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting.

Let me try to recount the C-C bonds.

The molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking for C-C single bonds:

1. Between (CH3)2C and the next C (but that's a double bond, so no C-C single bond there).

2. Between the next C and CH2: single bond →1.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3): single →2.

4. Between CH(CH3) and CH2: single →3.

5. Between CH2 and CH: single →4.

6. Between CH and C=C: no, that's a double bond.

So, four C-C single bonds in the main chain.

Plus the C-C bonds in the branches:

- (CH3)2C has two C-C bonds →2.

- CH(CH3) has one C-C bond →3.

- C=C(CH3)2 has two C-C bonds →5.

So, total C-C single bonds:5.

But earlier I thought 12, which is incorrect. So now I'm getting 5 C-C single bonds.

But that would change everything.

So, let me recount.

Total C-C single bonds in the molecule:5.

C=C bonds:2.

C-H bonds:20.

So, bonds formed:

5×200=1000.

2×300=600.

20×400=8000.

Total:1000+600=1600; 1600+8000=9600.

Reactant bonds:

C-C in graphite:12 moles →18 bonds →18 ×200=3600.

H-H →10 ×100=1000.

Total reactants bonds:3600 +1000=4600.

ΔHf°=4600 -9600= -5000 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the intended answer is option B) 67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see how that's derived.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the given bond energies without considering the enthalpy of atomization.

In that case, assuming all C-C bonds are 200 kJ/mol.

So, reactants:

12 C atoms: each has 3 C-C bonds, but in graphite, each bond is shared, so 12 ×1.5=18 bonds →18 ×200=3600.

10 H2 →10 ×100=1000.

Total reactant bonds:4600.

Product bonds:

n_C-C=12 →12×200=2400.

n_C=C=2 →2×300=600.

n_C-H=20 →20×400=8000.

Total product bonds:2400+600+8000=11,000.

ΔHf°=4600 -11,000= -6400.

No, that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should subtract product bonds from reactant bonds.

ΔHf°=11,000 -4600=6400.

Which is not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the molecule as a sum of its bonds and uses the given bond energies to calculate the enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total number of each bond type in the molecule and compute the enthalpy as:

ΔHf° = (Σ bond energies of reactants) - (Σ bond energies of products).

But without the correct count, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B)67.4 kJ/mol, which is approximately 67 kJ/mol. But I can't see how that would be derived from the given data.

Wait, perhaps the calculation uses the number of C-C and C=C bonds as 9 and 2 respectively.

So, 9 ×200=1800, 2 ×300=600, 20 ×400=8000 → 1800+600=2400 +8000=10,400.

Reactant bonds:18 ×200=3600, 10 ×100=1000 →4600.

ΔHf=4600 -10,400= -5800.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B) 67.4 kJ/mol, which could be 2000 /30, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of C-C bonds as 8, which would give:

8×200=1600, 2×300=600, 20×400=8000 →1600+600=2200 +8000=10,200.

ΔHf=4600 -10,200= -5600.

No match.

I think I'm stuck and perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I can't see how.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the molecule `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2`, the problem provides bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \left( \text{Sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants} \right) - \left( \text{Sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products} \right)
\]

### Reactants:
1. **Carbon (graphite):**  
   The enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as 1000 kJ/mol. In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbons, and there are \( \frac{3}{2} \) moles of C-C bonds per mole of carbon.  
   For 12 moles of carbon:  
   \[
   \text{Number of C-C bonds} = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18
   \]  
   Each C-C bond energy is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Bond energy per C-C bond} = \frac{1000}{1.5} \approx 666.67 \, \text{kJ/mol}
   \]  
   Total energy to break C-C bonds:  
   \[
   18 \times 666.67 \approx 12,000 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

2. **Hydrogen (H₂):**  
   For 10 moles of H₂:  
   \[
   \text{Number of H-H bonds} = 10
   \]  
   Each H-H bond energy is 100 kJ/mol:  
   \[
   10 \times 100 = 1,000 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

Total energy to break bonds in reactants:  
\[
12,000 + 1,000 = 13,000 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Products:
The molecule has the following bonds:  
- **C-C single bonds:** 12  
- **C=C double bonds:** 2  
- **C-H bonds:** 20  

Using the given bond energies:  
- C-C single bond: 200 kJ/mol  
- C=C double bond: 300 kJ/mol  
- C-H bond: 400 kJ/mol  

Total energy released from forming bonds in the molecule:  
\[
(12 \times 200) + (2 \times 300) + (20 \times 400) = 2,400 + 600 + 8,000 = 11,000 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Enthalpy of Formation:
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{Bonds broken} - \text{Bonds formed}
\]  
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = 13,000 - 11,000 = 2,000 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Conversion to kJ/g:
The molecular formula of the compound is \( \text{C}_{12}\text{H}_{20} \), with a molar mass of:  
\[
12 \times 12 + 20 \times 1 = 164 \, \text{g/mol}
\]  
Thus, the enthalpy of formation per gram is:  
\[
\frac{2,000}{164} \approx 12.2 \, \text{kJ/g}
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 11,200 kJ/mol:** This is far too high and inconsistent with the calculations.  
- **B) 67.4 kJ/mol:** This does not match the calculated value of 2,000 kJ/mol.  
- **C) 11.44 kJ/g:** This is close to the calculated value of \( \approx 12.2 \, \text{kJ/g} \), but slightly lower.  
- **D) 1,900 kJ/g:** This is far too high and inconsistent with the calculations.

Given the options, the closest match to the calculated value is **C) 11.44 kJ/g**, though the exact calculation yields \( \approx 12.2 \, \text{kJ/g} \). This discrepancy may arise from rounding or interpretation differences in the problem setup.
