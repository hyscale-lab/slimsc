Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see. So, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Hmm. I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome if you measured the quantity many times on identically prepared systems.

The particle is in a state that's a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, because σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. Oh, so I think we can compute the expectation value of each term separately and then add them. Because expectation values are linear, right? So ⟨A + B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities times their eigenvalues.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me compute the normalization. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so it's normalized, which is good.

The probability for |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, so 25% chance. For |↓⟩, it's |sqrt(3)/2|^2 which is 3/4, 75% chance.

The eigenvalue for |↑⟩ is +1 (since σz |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩), and for |↓⟩ it's -1. So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Got that.

Then, the expectation value for 10σz would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5. But wait, I'm not done yet. I need to compute the expectation value of 5σx as well.

So now, let's think about σx. Oh, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are the states where spin is up and down along the x-axis. But wait, our state is in the z-basis. So I'll need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, where ψ is the given state.

Alternatively, σx can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So in terms of basis
