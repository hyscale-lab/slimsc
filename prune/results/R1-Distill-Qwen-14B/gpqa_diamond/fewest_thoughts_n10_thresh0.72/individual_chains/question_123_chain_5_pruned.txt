Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

So the problem says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. And the question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the frames here. So in the Galaxy's frame of reference, the ejecta is moving towards the center. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta. That makes sense because if one object is moving towards another, each sees the other approaching at the same speed.

But the key here is to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, time intervals can differ between frames because of time dilation in special relativity. So I probably need to use the time dilation formula.

So time dilation formula is t' = gamma (t - (v x t)/cÂ² ) or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The time experienced in one frame (proper time) relates to the time in another frame.

Alternatively, the relation between time in the two frames can be found using the Lorentz transformations. Because the frames are moving relative to each other at a high speed.

Let me denote:
- The Galaxy's frame as S.
- The ejecta's frame as S'.

In the S frame (Galaxy), the ejecta is moving with speed v towards the center. In the S' frame (ejecta), the Galaxy is moving towards them at speed v. Since both are inertial frames, it's a matter of relative velocity.

Wait, from the problem statement, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So that would be the relative speed between the two frames. So v is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify: The problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.
