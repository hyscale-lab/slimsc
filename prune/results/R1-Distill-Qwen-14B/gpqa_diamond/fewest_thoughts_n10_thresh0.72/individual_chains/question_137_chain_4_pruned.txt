Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding how many revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. Let me read the details again.

The proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The accelerating voltage is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, I remember that in cyclotrons, particles move in a magnetic field and get accelerated by an electric field that's alternating. The frequency of the electric field is synchronized with the particle's motion. Synchrocyclotron is a type of cyclotron, probably for particles that are already relativistic.

So, the key here is probably to relate the kinetic energy gained to the number of revolutions. Each revolution, the particle gains some energy from the electric field.

But wait, the problem says it undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe each acceleration corresponds to a certain energy gain, and the number of revolutions needed to reach the target energy.

I think the formula I need is the one that relates the kinetic energy to the number of revolutions. Let me recall.

In a cyclotron, the time period for each revolution is T = (2πm)/(qB), where m is mass, q charge, B magnetic field. The accelerating voltage U0 provides energy each time the proton goes through the gap. So each time, the proton gains energy equal to the voltage times the charge? Or wait, because the voltage is the potential difference, the energy gain per revolution is qU0, right?

Wait, but U(t) is a cosine function. Oh wait, the maximum voltage is U0, so the maximum energy per half-cycle is U0. Because in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates, so each time the particle passes through the gap, it gets a kick of either +U0 or -U0, but the kinetic energy increases by U0 each time, I think.

Wait, but wait, the frequency ν is given as a function of alpha. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

So, the proton starts with negligible KE, so T ≈ 0. It
