Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. Hmm, let's think about it.

In our universe, magnets have both north and south poles; you can't isolate them. That's why, in Maxwell's equations, the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. The equation is ∇·B = 0. This implies that there are no isolated magnetic poles, right? So if in this parallel universe, they can have isolated poles, that must mean this equation changes.

Wait, Maxwell's equations have four parts. Let me list them out to be clear.

1. Gauss's Law: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀.
2. Gauss's Law for magnetism: ∇·B = 0.
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

So which of these would change if isolated magnetic poles exist? Well, the presence of isolated poles would imply that the divergence of B isn't zero anymore. So equation 2 would change. But wait, the question says which equations are different. Because in our universe, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. If poles are isolated, then maybe equation 2 becomes ∇·B = something else, perhaps a magnetic charge density, like rho_m or something.

But the question is about which equations are different. So in our case, the second equation would change, but what about the others?

Wait, another thought: Maxwell's equations in our universe also enforce that magnetic monopoles don't exist. So if they do exist, both the divergence and the curl of B might change. Because, for instance, the curl of B (equation 4) in our universe includes the current density and the time derivative of E. If there are magnetic currents, perhaps that equation would also change.

Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The existence of isolated magnetic charges would modify two of Maxwell's equations. Let me see.

In the standard equations, we have:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t )

If magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 2 would have a term for the magnetic charge density, like ∇·B = ρ_m / ε₀ or something similar. But what about equation 4?

Wait, in Maxwell's equations, when you have magnetic charges, both the divergence and the curl equations change. Because the presence of magnetic current would modify Ampère's law, which is equation 4. Let me think about it.

Wait, another approach. The existence of magnetic monopoles would mean that both the divergence of B is non-zero and that the curl of B has additional terms. So which equations are modified?

In our universe, equation 2 is ∇·
