Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about some mixtures and reactions. Let me read it again carefully.

So, there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum under heat, it undergoes some reaction to form mixture Y of two liquids. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, giving a single substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is a common solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. Oh, and there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm. So, I need to figure out what's in mixture X and Y, then calculate the hydrogens in X's components.

Let me think about the reactions involved.

Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That usually happens when there are double or triple bonds that can undergo addition reactions. Decolorizing bromine suggests that the mixture has unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. But wait, X is a mixture of two liquids. So maybe each component undergoes a reaction?

Wait, no. Wait—Platinum is a catalyst. Oh, wait, but the problem says it's a mixture X of two liquids. When treated with Pt and heated, it forms mixture Y of two other liquids via disproportionation. So perhaps the components of X are undergoing some kind of redox reactions, maybe adding hydrogen.

Wait, when you hydrogenate a compound, you typically add hydrogen across double bonds. But the question is about hydrogenation of X and Y later.

Wait, let's go step by step.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. So X contains compounds with unsaturated bonds (like alkenes or alkynes). Since it's a mixture of two liquids, they each must have unsaturated bonds.

Then, X is treated with Pt and heated. Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation. Oh wait, but wait—no, the problem says it's treated with platinum when heated. So, the reaction is likely hydrogenation, but wait, what's the source of H2? Oh, probably hydrogen is present. So when you hydrogenate, alkenes become alkanes, alkyne becomes alkanes or maybe cis alkenes. But wait, the problem says that after this treatment, we get mixture Y, which is formed due to disproportionation. Hmm, wait, that's conflicting. Because hydrogenation is typically a reduction, but the problem says it's a disproportionation. Oh wait, perhaps the reaction is different. Maybe the components of X are undergoing some kind of decomposition or isomerization under Pt and heat.

Wait, perhaps the components in X are something that can undergo isomerization. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: mixture X is a mixture of alkenes and something else. When treated with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo a reaction that leads to a rearrangement or cleavage, leading to a different mixture.

But wait, the problem says that the mixture Y is formed via disproportionation. So, perhaps each component in X undergoes a disproportionation reaction.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two different compounds, each might undergo a different reaction. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the two components of X are the same but in different forms, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the two components in X are each undergoing a hydrogenation reaction, but in a way that leads to different products. Wait, but in that case, perhaps the original X has two different alkenes, which when hydrogenated, give alkanes. But then why does the problem say that Y is formed via disproportionation? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions with platinum, and both give the same product Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H by mass. Let's compute Z's formula.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7. Because 14.28% is approximately 1/7 (since 1/7 ≈ 14.29%). So if Z is a hydrocarbon, CnHm, then the mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) = 1/7.

Let me write that equation:

(m) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

Cross-multiplying,

7m = 12n + m

6m = 12n

m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH(2n).

Which hydrocarbons have that? Well, ethene is C2H4, but no, wait, ethene is C2H4, which would be m=4, n=2, m=2n. So ethene? But wait, ethene is an alkene. But Z is a product after hydrogenation. Wait, hydrogenation of alkenes would add H2, turning double bonds into single bonds, so the product would be an alkane.

Wait, but if Z is a hydrocarbon with formula CnH(2n), that's an alkene, but if Z is an alkene, but it's formed by hydrogenation, which usually adds H across double bonds. So that's confusing.

Wait, no: Wait, Z is the product of hydrogenation of both X and Y. So hydrogenation is adding H2. So if Z is CnH2n, that's an alkene. But adding H2 to a double bond would give an alkane, which is CnH2n+2. So this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 14.28% = 1/7.

So,

m / (12n + m) = 1/7.

Cross multiplying,

7m = 12n + m

6m = 12n

Simplify,

m = 2n.

So, formula is CnH2n.

Which is an alkene or alkyne. Wait, but if Z is formed by hydrogenation, but Z is a hydrocarbon with a double bond, that can't be because hydrogenation would saturate the double bonds.

Wait, that suggests I must have messed up something. Because hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes. So alkanes have formula CnH2n+2.

But our calculation here suggests Z is CnH2n, which is an alkene. So this is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I should check the math again.

Wait, 14.28% is 1/7, so 14.28 = 100/7.

So,

m/(12n + m) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by (12n + m):

m = (12n + m)/7.

Multiply both sides by 7:

7m = 12n + m.

Subtract m from both sides:

6m =12n.

Divide both sides by 6:

m = 2n.

So formula is CnH2n.

Hmm, that's correct, but that would be an alkene, which can't be because it's the product of hydrogenation.

Wait, unless Z is an alkyne, but then hydrogenation of an alkyne would typically give an alkane or an alkene, depending on conditions. Wait, if you hydrogenate an alkyne fully, you get an alkane, but if you partially hydrogenate, you get an alkene.

Wait, but the problem says that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So if Z has any double bonds, they would react with H2. So Z must be a fully saturated compound, like an alkane.

So, that suggests that my earlier calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try again.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So,

mass of H / mass of hydrocarbon = 1/7.

Let the formula be CnHm.

So,

(m * 1) / (12n + m) ) = 1/7.

So,

7m = 12n + m.

6m = 12n.

m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n.

But if Z is an alkane, it should be CnH2n+2.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but Z is not an alkane. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass fraction is not 14.28% of the compound, but of the mixture. But the problem says it's the mass fraction of hydrogen in substance Z, so it's the same as the formula.

Wait, maybe Z is not an alkane but a cyclic compound, but I don't know.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that Z is a constituent of mixture Y. So Y contains Z.

And when X and Y are hydrogenated, they both give Z.

Wait, let me think about this.

So, mixture X has two components, let's say A and B. When X is hydrogenated (probably with H2 and Pt), the products are both A' and B', but since it's under severe conditions, maybe both are fully hydrogenated. But the problem says that when X and Y are hydrogenated, they give the same Z. So, both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So Z must be the fully hydrogenated form of the components of X and Y.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to model this.

Suppose X is a mixture of two alkenes, A and B. When each is hydrogenated, they become alkanes A' and B'. But the problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same Z. So A' and B' must be the same as Z, but that would imply that A and B are the same as each other? Or perhaps Y's components, when hydrogenated, also become Z. Hmm.

Wait, but Y is formed by the reaction of X with Pt and heat. So X → (Pt, heat) → Y.

Then, hydrogenation of X → Z, and hydrogenation of Y → Z.

So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So perhaps X's components are more unsaturated than Y's. Because when you hydrogenate X, you get Z, which is saturated. Similarly, hydrogenating Y (maybe less saturated) also gives Z.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the possible structures.

Let me think about Z. It's a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H. So, as before, formula is CnH2n.

Wait, that's an alkene.

Wait, but if Z is an alkene, but Z is the product of hydrogenation, that can't be. Because hydrogenation adds H across double bonds, turning them into single bonds. So, if Z is an alkene, that suggests that the hydrogenation is incomplete, but the problem says severe conditions, so maybe it's over hydrogenated? No, no, severe conditions generally mean more complete reaction.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the setup.

Wait, perhaps Z is a cyclic alkane. Let's see, cyclohexane is C6H12. Its H% is (12)/(84) = 14.28%. Oh! Wait a minute! 12/84 is 1/7. So 14.28% exactly.

So, Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.

So, Z is cyclohexane. So when X and Y are hydrogenated, they both produce cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexane is an alkane, so it's fully saturated. So, perhaps the original components of X and Y are more unsaturated than cyclohexane.

Wait, but wait—hydrogenation would add H2 to double bonds. So, if X's components have double bonds, hydrogenation would convert them into single bonds. So, if Z is cyclohexane, then perhaps the original components in X and Y are rings with double bonds, like cyclohexene or something else.

Wait, but no: cyclohexene would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and something else, then hydrogenation would give cyclohexane and whatever that other compound is.

But the problem says that when X and Y are hydrogenated, they both give only Z. So, both X and Y's components, when hydrogenated, give Z. So, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes which hydrogenate to give Z, and Y is a mixture of two cyclohexenes or something else which also gives Z upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but the problem says that the hydrogenation of both gives Z, which is a constituent of Y. So Z is part of Y. Hmm.

Wait, let me think of the reaction steps again.

X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, X's components are unsaturated. They could be alkenes, alkynes, or aromatic compounds.

When X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form Y. Disproportionation usually involves a change in oxidation state. For example, in the decomposition of 2-propanol to acetone and water, that's a disproportionation (but that's without a catalyst, I think).

But in this case, the reaction is with Pt and heat. So perhaps each component in X is undergoing a reaction where one is oxidized and another is reduced. But since it's a mixture, maybe each component is being split into different products.

Wait, but Y is a mixture of two liquids, which don't decolorize bromine water. So Y's components are either saturated or have conjugated double bonds, which don't react with bromine water as readily.

Wait, but the question states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in mixture X. Hmm, that's an important clue. So X's components don't have conjugated double bonds. So any double bonds in X are isolated.

So, perhaps X is a mixture of alkenes without conjugation, and when treated with Pt and heat, they undergo some kind of isomerization or perhaps hydrogenation.

Wait, but the reaction is called a disproportionation. So, perhaps each of X's components is breaking down into two different products, one being more oxidized and the other more reduced.

Wait, but if each component in X is undergoing a disproportionation, then each would split into two, leading to four products. But Y is a mixture of two, so maybe each X component produces one product each, but perhaps one of the products is the same.

Alternatively, maybe the components of X undergo different reactions. For example, one component in X becomes two in Y, and another component in X becomes another component in Y.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of specific examples.

Let me suppose that X consists of two alkenes. Upon treatment with Pt and heat, they undergo hydrogenation. But that wouldn't be a disproportionation. So perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a mixture of two dienes, which upon treatment with Pt and heat undergo some rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. When treated with H2 and Pt, the alkene becomes an alkane, and the alkyne could become an alkene or a trans-alkene, but that doesn't fit the disproportionation description.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't hydrogenation. Let me think: what reactions occur with Pt as a catalyst and heat? One possibility is isomerization, like in the case of cracking or isomerization of alkanes, but that might not involve double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrogenolysis or some kind of cleavage.

Wait, another approach: Z is cyclohexane, which comes from hydrogenation of X and Y.

So, the components of X must have double bonds that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane.

Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. So, if a component in X is cyclohexene (C6H10), hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. Similarly, if a component is 1,3-diene, hydrogenation would give a diol or something else? No, hydrogenation adds H2 across double bonds, turning double bonds into single.

Wait, but cyclohexene is C6H10. When hydrogenated, becomes C6H12. So, perhaps X contains cyclohexene and another compound which, when hydrogenated, also becomes cyclohexane. Hmm, but that would require the other component to also have a double bond that, upon hydrogenation, becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if you have two different alkenes, hydrogenation would give two different alkanes. So, unless both alkenes hydrogenate to the same alkane, which is cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond. If I have another compound with two double bonds, maybe when hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, for example, if X has 1,3-cyclohexadiene (two double bonds), hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, giving cyclohexane. So, 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) → cyclohexane (C6H12). So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene, then hydrogenation of X would give a mixture of cyclohexane and cyclohexane, which is just cyclohexane. But that would require both starting materials to hydrogenate to the same product. Then, what would Y be?

Wait, but according to the problem, when X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes disproportionation to form Y. So, Y has two components which don't decolorize bromine, meaning they're not as reactive towards bromine.

Wait, another thought: if X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with one double bond, and when treated with Pt and H2, they undergo hydrogenation to form alkanes. But then Y would be the alkanes, which don't react with bromine. But the problem states that Y is formed via disproportionation, not hydrogenation.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the hydrogenation part again.

If both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is cyclohexane, then the components of X and Y must have double bonds that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. So, perhaps X's components are cyclohexene and something else that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

Wait, but then what about Y? Y is a mixture of two liquids formed by X's disproportionation. So perhaps one component in X is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, and the other undergoes a reaction that also gives cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of a di-substituted alkene and another compound. Let me think of an example.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of 1,3-butadiene and another compound. But 1,3-butadiene has conjugated double bonds, but the problem states that X has no conjugated multiple bonds. So that's not possible.

Wait, another possibility: X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with one isolated double bond. When they undergo hydrogenation, they become alkanes. But for both X and Y to hydrogenate to Z, their hydrogenation products must be Z. So, both X and Y's components when hydrogenated give Z. So, perhaps X's components are alkenes that hydrogenate to Z, and Y's components are something else that hydrogenate to Z as well.

Wait, but Y is formed by X's reaction with Pt and heat, which is a disproportionation. So perhaps X's components are breaking down into different products in Y, which themselves when hydrogenated give Z.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should think about the possible structures of X and Y.

Since Z is cyclohexane, perhaps Y contains cyclohexane and another compound that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But that doesn't make sense because cyclohexane is already an alkane and hydrogenation wouldn't change it.

Alternatively, Y could contain cyclohexene and another compound. Upon hydrogenation, the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the other compound also becomes cyclohexane. So, Y could be a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene which hydrogenates to cyclohexane.

But wait, if Y contains cyclohexene, then bromine water would decolorize it, but the problem says Y doesn't. So, Y's components don't have any reactive double bonds or conjugated systems.

Hmm, so perhaps Y's components are either fully saturated or have conjugated double bonds which do not react with bromine. But the problem states that X has no conjugated bonds. So, Y's components might have conjugated bonds, but X's don't.

Wait, but the reaction of X with Pt and heat leads to Y. So Y's components could have conjugated bonds, but X's don't.

But then, Y's components not decolorizing bromine suggests they don't have any double bonds or have conjugated ones that don't react.

Wait, but alkanes don't have double bonds, so they don't react with bromine. So perhaps Y is a mixture of alkanes and something else.

Alternatively, maybe Y contains a ring structure without double bonds, like cyclohexane.

Wait, but Z is cyclohexane, so if Y is a mixture of two alkanes, one of which is cyclohexane, but when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane only. That doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of alkanes doesn't do anything.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me try to outline what I know:

1. X is a mixture of two liquids; each has unsaturated bonds because they decolorize bromine.

2. X is treated with Pt and heat, undergoes disproportionation to form Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine.

3. Hydrogenation of X gives Z, hydrogenation of Y gives Z.

4. Z is a hydrocarbon (C6H12, as earlier determined) which is a solvent, so likely cyclohexane.

5. X's components have no conjugated double bonds.

So, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with one double bond, non-conjugated. When treated with Pt and H2, they hydrogenate to alkanes.

Wait, but if Z is C6H12, which is cyclohexane, then the alkenes in X would have to be cyclohexene and another alkene that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexene is C6H10. Hydrogenation would give C6H12, which is cyclohexane.

So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene, maybe another cyclohexene derivative. But then, why would the mixture Y be formed via disproportionation?

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, when treated with Pt and heat, undergo a reaction that breaks them into smaller molecules. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of two alkenes which, upon treatment with Pt and H2, undergo some kind of addition.

Wait, another angle: Y is a mixture of two other liquids, which don't react with bromine. So Y's components are either alkanes or have structures that don't support bromine addition, like rings without double bonds.

Wait, but if Z is cyclohexane, which comes from the hydrogenation of Y, then Y must have a component that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. So perhaps Y contains cyclohexene, which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But why would Y not decolorize bromine? Because if Y contains cyclohexene, it would react with bromine. Oh, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps Y contains cyclohexane and another compound. But when you hydrogenate Y, you get Z, which is cyclohexane. So the other compound in Y must also hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But that's not possible unless the other compound is cyclohexene. But then Y would decolorize bromine, which it doesn't.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Wait, maybe the key is that Y results from a disproportionation of X. So, maybe the components of X undergo different reactions. Let me think of a typical disproportionation reaction.

One example is the decomposition of 2-propanol into acetone (oxidized) and methanol (reduced). But how does that apply here?

Alternatively, maybe each component in X undergoes a reaction where a double bond is broken. For example, if X has a diene, it could break into two alkenes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the components in X are each undergoing a hydrogenation but in a way that produces different products. Wait, but the problem says Y is formed by a disproportionation, which involves a change in oxidation state. So perhaps the components in X are being both oxidized and reduced.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection. Maybe I should think about the specific hydrogenation results.

Since both X and Y hydrogenate to Z (cyclohexane), perhaps Y contains a structure that when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane. For example, if Y has benzene rings, but that's probably not since benzene wouldn't hydrogenate to cyclohexane under mild conditions but would require more vigorous conditions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y contains a naphthalene derivative, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps Y has an aromatic ring, but that's probably not the case because aromatic rings are usually more stable and wouldn't easily undergo hydrogenation under the given conditions.

Wait, but maybe Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another compound that, when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane. But that doesn't make sense because cyclohexane is already an alkane.

Wait, perhaps Y is a mixture of cyclohexane and another di-substituted alkene that, when hydrogenated, also becomes cyclohexane. But earlier, that would require the other alkene to be a diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a mixture of two alkanes, one of which is cyclohexane, but that doesn't fit.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should try to approach this from the start with the given information.

Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is formed by hydrogenation of X and Y. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So, perhaps X and Y are each a mixture of two alkenes that hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Wait, but that would imply that X is a mixture of two alkenes that each hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene which, when hydrogenated, also becomes cyclohexane. But how? Unless the other alkene is another cyclohexene derivative, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane and another compound which when hydrogenated also becomes cyclohexane. But that seems impossible unless the other compound is an alkyne.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne. The alkene would hydrogenate to an alkane, and the alkyne would hydrogenate to an alkene or an alkane, depending on conditions.

Wait, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and cyclohexyne (if such a thing exists), then upon hydrogenation, the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the cyclohexyne becomes cyclohexane (if hydrogenated fully) or cyclohexene (if partially hydrogenated). But the problem says that hydrogenation of X gives only Z, so both must hydrogenate to Z.

So, cyclohexene → cyclohexane, and another component must also → cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but what alkyne would hydrogenate to cyclohexane? Maybe a di-yne? For example, 1,2-cyclohexadiyne. Hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, giving cyclohexane. So, if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,2-cyclohexadiyne, then hydrogenation would give cyclohexane and cyclohexane, which is just cyclohexane.

But then, Y is the product of X treated with Pt and heat, which causes a disproportionation. So, perhaps cyclohexene and 1,2-cyclohexadiyne undergo some reaction upon treatment with Pt and heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the component is a di-substituted alkene with a single double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes which, when treated with Pt and H2, undergo hydrogenation to form cyclohexane. But hydrogenation would require adding H2 across the double bonds. So, each component in X is an alkene that, when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but that would mean each component is cyclohexene, but that's a single compound, not a mixture. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should focus on the first part: determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in mixture X.

The options are 12,16,18,22.

Z is C6H12, which has 12 H atoms. But X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with 6 carbons (since Z is C6H12). So each component in X is a C6H10 molecule because hydrogenation would add 2 H (from H2) to become C6H12.

Wait, if X's components are C6H10, then each molecule has 10 H. Since X is a mixture of two equimolar components, let's say each is C6H10. So each molecule contributes 10 H. So two molecules would have 20 H. But the options don't include 20. Hmm.

Wait, that's not matching the options. So perhaps each component in X has more than 6 carbons?

Wait, no, because Z is C6H12, so X's components must hydrogenate to give C6H12. So, X's components must be C6H10 (alkene) or C6H8 (di-alkene), etc.

Wait, if X is a mixture of two C6H10 alkenes, then each has 10 H. So two components would have 10 H each, so 20 H in total. But none of the options have 20, so that's probably not right.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not C6. Maybe they're smaller or larger.

Wait, but Z is C6H12. So perhaps X's components are something like C3H6 and C3H6. But when hydrogenated, they would become C3H8. But that doesn't match Z's formula.

Wait, perhaps Z is something else. Wait, earlier I thought Z is C6H12, but maybe I should re-calculate.

Wait, the mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So,

mass of H / (mass of C + H) = 1/7.

Let me write the formula as CnHm.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

Cross multiply:

7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So formula is CnH2n.

Wait, which is an alkene, but as before.

But earlier I thought Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12, which fits CnH2n with n=6. But cyclohexane is an alkane, which would have m=2n+2. Wait, I'm confused again.

Wait, perhaps Z is not cyclohexane but something else. Let me think of another compound where m=2n.

For example, ethylene (C2H4): m=4, n=2. 4=2*2. So, yes, ethylene is C2H4.

But ethylene is an alkene, and if Z is ethylene, that would mean that when X is hydrogenated, it gives ethylene. But that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of alkenes would add H2, giving alkanes.

Wait, but wait, perhaps Z is ethylene. Then, X would be a mixture of something that, when hydrogenated, gives ethylene. But that's impossible because hydrogenation would add H, not remove.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should take a different approach.

Let me suppose that Z is ethylene (C2H4), which has m=4, n=2. So 4/ (24 +4) )=4/28=1/7, which is 14.28%. So that fits.

But then, when X is hydrogenated, it gives ethylene. But hydrogenation adds H, not removes. So this can't be.

Wait, maybe Z is propyne (C3H4). m=4, n=3. 4/(36+4)=4/40=1/10=10%, which doesn't match. So no.

Wait, perhaps Z is butadiene (C4H8). m=8, n=4. 8/(48+8)=8/56=1/7, 14.28%. So, butadiene would have 14.28% H. But wait, butadiene is an alkene (actually, diene), and when hydrogenated, it would become butane (C4H10). But in the problem, Z is produced via hydrogenation, so if Z is butadiene, that can't be because hydrogenation would add H, not remove.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to list all possible CnH2n hydrocarbons where H is 14.28%:

For n=1: CH2. Not possible, as it's just a radical.
n=2: C2H4. As above.
n=3: C3H6. m=6, 6/(36+6)=6/42=1/7. Yes, that works. So, propene (C3H6) has 6 H, and 6/(36+6)=6/42=1/7, which is 14.28% H.

So, Z could be propene. But then, if X and Y are hydrogenated to give propene, that would require X's components to be more unsaturated.

Wait, but propene is an alkene, so hydrogenation would add H2 to make propane. So that doesn't fit. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps Z is a cyclic alkene, like cyclopentene. Let's see: C5H8. H mass fraction is 8/(60+8)=8/68≈11.76%, which isn't 14.28%. So no.

Wait, maybe it's cyclopropane. C3H6. That's 6/(36+6)=6/42=14.28%. So cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is an alkane (no double bonds), so its hydrogenation wouldn't change it. So that can't be.

Wait, but earlier I thought Z is cyclohexane. Let me double-check.

Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. So H is 12/(72 +12)=12/84=1/7. So that's correct.

But cyclohexane is an alkane, so when you hydrogenate X and Y, which contain alkenes, you get cyclohexane. So X's components are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclohexane. So, X must contain alkenes with the formula C6H10.

So, each component in X is C6H10, which upon hydrogenation (adding 2 H) becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane).

So, X is a mixture of two C6H10 alkenes.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two C6H10 alkenes, then each has 10 H. So, two molecules would have 10 + 10 = 20 H atoms. But the options are 12,16,18,22.

Hmm, none of the options match 20, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X's components have more than two double bonds. For example, each component is a diene, C6H8. So when hydrogenated, they become C6H12.

In that case, each molecule in X has 8 H. Two such molecules would have 8 +8 =16 H.

Ah, 16 is option B. So perhaps the total H is 16.

So, the answer would be B) 18? Wait, no, 8+8=16.

Wait, but let me confirm: if X is a mixture of two C6H8 dienes, then each has 8 H. Two of them would have 16 H in total.

So, the total number of H atoms in X's two liquids would be 16.

So, the answer would be option B) 18? Wait, no, 16 is option A.

Wait, looking back:

Options are:
A) 16
B) 18
C)22
D)12

So, 16 is option A.

But earlier I thought each molecule has 8 H. So two molecules would have 16 H. So the answer is A)16.

But wait, let's think again: if X is a mixture of two C6H10 alkenes, each has 10 H. Two components → 20 H. Not an option. But if they're C6H8, then each has 8 H. Two components → 16 H, which is option A.

But wait, earlier I thought Z is C6H12, so X's components must have two less H (so C6H10) if X is a single alkene, but if X's components are dienes (C6H8), then adding two H2 molecules (4 H) would give C6H12.

So, yes, that makes sense. So X's components are C6H8 dienes.

So, each has 8 H. Two components → 8 +8 =16 H. So the answer is A)16.

But wait, another thought: if X is a mixture of two C6H10 compounds, and each has 10 H, then two would have 20. But that's not an option. So perhaps each component is not C6 but smaller.

Wait, perhaps Z is C3H6. So, for each X component, when hydrogenated, becomes C3H6. So, the X component would be C3H4 (alkyne). When hydrogenated, it becomes C3H6 (alkene). But that doesn't fit because the problem states that Z is a constituent of Y and doesn't react further with hydrogen. If Z is an alkene, it would react with H2, which contradicts.

So, perhaps Z is an alkane, which would require the X components to be alkenes that hydrogenate to alkanes.

Wait, let me think again. If Z is C3H8, then H fraction is 8/(36+8)=8/44≈18.18%, which is not 14.28%. So not possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought Z is C6H12, which has 14.28% H. So X's components are C6H8 dienes. So, each of X's components has 8 H. Two components → 16 H.

So, the answer is A)16.


The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, given the reactions and properties described. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes).
   - X undergoes a reaction with platinum and heat to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, suggesting Y's components are saturated or have conjugated bonds.
   - Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions produces a single substance Z, a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent.
   - Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is fully saturated (an alkane).
   - There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

2. **Identifying Z**:
   - The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{7} \). Using the formula for a hydrocarbon \( C_nH_m \), the equation for the mass fraction of hydrogen is:
     \[
     \frac{m}{12n + m} = \frac{1}{7}.
     \]
     Solving this gives \( m = 2n \), so Z has the formula \( C_nH_{2n} \).
   - For \( n = 6 \), Z is \( C_6H_{12} \), which corresponds to cyclohexane, a fully saturated hydrocarbon (alkane). This matches the description of Z as a solvent and a constituent of Y.

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, produce Z (\( C_6H_{12} \)). This means the components of X and Y must have unsaturated bonds that, upon hydrogenation, result in cyclohexane.
   - Since Z is fully saturated, the components of X must be alkenes or alkynes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane.

4. **Structure of X**:
   - X is a mixture of two liquids with unsaturated bonds. The problem specifies that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X, so the double bonds in X are isolated.
   - To form Z (\( C_6H_{12} \)) upon hydrogenation, the components of X must have the formula \( C_6H_{10} \) (alkenes) or \( C_6H_8 \) (alkynes or dienes). However, since X decolorizes bromine water, the components are likely alkenes (\( C_6H_{10} \)).

5. **Total Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - If X is a mixture of two equimolar alkenes (\( C_6H_{10} \)), each molecule contains 10 hydrogen atoms.
   - Since X is an equimolar mixture of two such components, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X is:
     \[
     10 + 10 = 20.
     \]
   - However, 20 is not one of the options. Reconsidering, if X consists of two dienes (\( C_6H_8 \)), each molecule contains 8 hydrogen atoms. The total number of hydrogen atoms in X would then be:
     \[
     8 + 8 = 16.
     \]
   - This matches option **A**.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **16**.
