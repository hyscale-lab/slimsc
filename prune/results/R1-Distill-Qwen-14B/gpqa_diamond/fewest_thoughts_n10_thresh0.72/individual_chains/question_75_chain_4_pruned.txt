Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the mouse model. Let's start by going through the problem step by step.

The researcher made a transgenic mouse model to overexpress GADD45G. They added an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. They looked at the plus strand construct sequence, and I need to figure out what's wrong based on that.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Missense mutation in HA sequence. Well, if the HA sequence is wrong, the tag might not work, but that would affect detection, not expression. Since the problem is overexpression, maybe not this.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. Let me check the sequence for any in-frame stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG (which is methionine, the start). Let me scan through for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking through the sequence:

The sequence starts with ATG, then TAC, CCC, etc. Let me pick out codons. The first few are ATG (start), TAC (tyrosine), CCC (proline), ATA (isoleucine), CGA (arg), TGG (trp), etc. Wait, wait. Let me look for TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Hmm, scanning through... Let me look for a TGA. Oh, wait, I see several G's and A's. Let me check each codon.

Looking from the beginning:
ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGG TCC AGA TT... Hmm. Wait, the first part is ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGG TCC AGA TTAC GCC AAA TGA... Oh wait, at the 18th codon, I see TGA. Let's count:

1. ATG
2. TAC
3. CCC
4. ATA
5. CGA
6. TGG
7. TCC
8. AGA
9. TTA
10. CGG
11. CCA
12. AGA
Wait, another approach: Let's break it down in triplets. Let me do that.

The entire sequence:
