Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking me to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when they undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positionsâ€”either ortho, meta, or para. The directing effect depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's an electron-donating or -withdrawing group.

Each substituent can influence the reactivity and the position where bromine adds. For para substitution to be favored, the substituent should either be a strong activating group (like -OCH3, -NH2) or a deactivating group that is meta-directing but in some cases can lead to para substitution when considering the overall activation.

Wait, no. Actually, activating groups are ortho/para directors because they donate electrons, making the ring more reactive. Deactivating groups are meta directors because they withdraw electrons, making the ring less reactive and directing the electrophile to the meta position.

But wait, wait. For example, nitro groups are strong deactivating, meta-directing. So when a nitro group is present, the incoming electrophile (like Br+) would add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. But wait, in some cases, especially with strong activating groups, para substitution might be more favorable.

Wait, but the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So, for each substituent, I need to assess whether the para product is the major or minor product, and compare all six.

Let me list the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group, +I effect), so it's ortho/para directing. So when bromine adds, it can go para to the methyl. So the para product would be a significant fraction.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's an ester group, specifically eth
