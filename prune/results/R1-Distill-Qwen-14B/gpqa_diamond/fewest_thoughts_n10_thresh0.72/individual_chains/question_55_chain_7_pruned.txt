Okay, so I've got this NMR question here. Let's see what it's about. The question is asking to identify an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, specifically cis and trans versions.

Alright, first, I need to recall what these compounds look like. Acetate esters typically have the structure R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. So for propenyl acetate, the R group would be propenyl, which is CH2CHCH2, but wait, no. Wait, propenyl has three carbons with a double bond. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere else? Hmm.

Wait, no. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. But wait, acetate esters are OAc-O-R. So perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc, but with a double bond. So propenyl could be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, acetate esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-CH3. So the ester would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, acetate esters are of the type R-O-CO-O-R', but actually, wait, no. No, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the ester would be R-O-CO-R', like ethyl acetate is CH3CO-O-CH2CH3. So in this case, the options are propenyl acetate or butenyl acetate. So the structure for propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, the ester would be R-OAc. So R is propenyl, which is CH2CHCH2 group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, propenyl has a double bond. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as R. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the ester is propenyl acetate.

Wait
