Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a operator P along some direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let me think through what I know.

First, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it probably has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. The problem gives me each of these components as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P in the direction of n, which is in the x-z plane. Wait, that means n has components (nx, 0, nz), right?

Eigenvectors for angular momentum or spin operators are related to the eigenstates of the spin in a particular direction. The eigenvalue here is +ħ/2, which suggests we're dealing with a spin-1/2 system, like an electron or a muon. The eigenvector should be a spinor corresponding to spin up along the direction n.

So, the operator P is a vector operator, and the total operator P would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector. So, P = nx P_x + nz P_z, since n is in the x-z plane and ny=0.

Wait, each component is given. Let me write them down as matrices:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P along direction n is:

P = nx P_x + nz P_z 

Substituting the matrices, that would be:

(ħ/2) * [ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So, combining the terms, the matrix becomes:

[[ (ħ/2) * nz, (ħ/2)* nx ],
 [ (ħ/2)* nx, -(ħ/2)* nz ] ]

So the matrix form is:

[ [ (nz ħ/2), (nx ħ/2) ],
  [ (nx ħ/2), -(nz ħ/2) ] ]

We need to find the eigenvector for this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue is λ = +ħ/2. So, the equation is (P - λ I) |v> = 0.

Let me write out the matrix (P - λ I):

[ [ (nz ħ/2 - ħ/2), (nx ħ/2) ],
  [ (nx ħ/2), -(nz ħ/2) - ħ/2 ) ] ]

Factor out ħ/2:

[ [ (nz -1) (ħ/2), nx (ħ/2) ],
  [ nx (ħ/2), -(nz +1) (ħ/2) ) ] ]

Which can be written as (ħ
