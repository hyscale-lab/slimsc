Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric describes the geometry of a space. So, this looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? It's in terms of dx and dy, so it's probably in two dimensions.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... I'm a bit confused. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? Like, it's a hyperbolic surface. But sometimes in higher dimensions, I think they can have metrics similar to spheres but with negative curvature.

Wait, but the question says the pseudosphere has radius r=2. So, what's the area of a pseudosphere? I remember that for a sphere in 2D (which is a circle), the area is 4πr², but wait, that's for a 3D sphere. No, wait, in 2D, the circumference is 2πr. Wait, no, that's for a circle. But this is a pseudosphere, which is a 2D surface with hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. A pseudosphere is actually a surface of revolution, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to something else. Oh wait, perhaps it's a two-dimensional surface embedded in three dimensions
