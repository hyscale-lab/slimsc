Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. The star moves back and forth, and that causes the spectral lines to shift in wavelength periodically.

The problem states that there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the main differences here are the Doppler shifts observed: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift.

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, we need to find the ratio P2/P1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method detects the velocity of the star, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ (P * sqrt(1-e²))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that simplifies.

But wait, since the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (which is like the Sun), M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so maybe the formula simplifies. 

The formula I think is K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (P)^(1/3) * c ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the inclination i is 90 degrees for both, because we detected the planet (assuming edge-on, but since both are detected, perhaps it's the same for both; but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's not needed).

Wait, but the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. So K is the velocity semi-amplitude. The Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is proportional to the velocity. So if planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 has 7, then the velocities are in the same ratio.

But wait, the Doppler shift (Δλ) is given by Δλ/λ = v/c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. So the ratio of the velocities v1 and v2 is the same as the ratio of their shifts (since λ is the same for the same spectral line). So v1/v2 = 5/7.

Wait, but the RV method measures the velocity, which is K. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

Now, what determines K? The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (2π/(P * c)) )^(1/3) ??? Hmm, perhaps I should think again.
