Okay, so I've got this problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining on it along the z-axis, and we're looking for the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. 

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern observed is called a diffraction pattern. The far field region is where the diffraction pattern is observed, which has maxima and minima. The question is specifically about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh wait, if N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So maybe this is a problem about circular aperture diffraction.

Wait, but the question says the apothems are all the same length a. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, all apothems are equal. So when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem? Or wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Because for a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius (the distance from center to a vertex). Let me think. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R by a = R * cos(π/N). Oh, right. So when N is very large, π/N is very small, so
