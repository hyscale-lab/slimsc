Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break down the information given.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. The options provided are four different compounds, so I need to match the spectral clues to one of them.

First, let's look at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, molecular weight of 156. So I'll need to calculate the molecular formulas of the options to see which one matches.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde has a molecular formula of C7H6O. Adding a Cl and another O (since it's 2-hydroxy), so the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me check: Cl is about 35.5, O is 16 each. So (7*12)+(5*1)+(35.5)+(2*16) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Hmm, close enough to 156. Molecular weight around 156-157. But wait, the molecular ion is at 156. So maybe that's a possibility. The other peak is at 158 (32%). That might be a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and 25% for 37Cl. So the molecular ion would have two peaks due to Cl isotopes: 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). The abundance ratio would be about 3:1, since it's two Cls? Wait, how many Cls does each option have?

Looking back, option A has one Cl. So the molecular ion would have the molecular weight plus the Cl isotopes. For one Cl, the isotopic peaks would be at m/z = molecular weight + 2 (since 37-35=2). So for the molecular ion, the main peak would be at 156 (assuming the molecular formula is 156, but wait, I thought earlier that 35Cl is 35.5, so the molecular weight is 156.5, but in the problem it's 156. So maybe the exact mass is 156, which would correspond with 35Cl. The other peak would be 158, which is 37Cl. So the ratio between 156 and 158 would be 75% to 25%, but the given is 100% at 156 and 32% at 158.

Wait, that doesn't add up. Because if it's a single Cl, the molecular ion would have two peaks: 15
