Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

So the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay equals c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I remember that in quantum mechanics, the angular momentum operators often involve Pauli matrices, but let me think.

Wait, I recall that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The structure of S given here seems like the Pauli y matrix. Let me write it out. The Pauli y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S is actually the Pauli y matrix, σy. So Ay = c * σy. Oh, but wait, c is h/(4π). Hmm, what's the usual expression for the angular momentum operator?

I think the spin angular momentum operator S for spin-1/2 particles like a muon is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, S = (ħ/2)σ. But in this problem, Ay is c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Let me check the units and see if that makes sense.

Wait, ħ is h/(2π), right? So if c is h/(4π), then c = ħ/2. So then, Ay = c * S. But wait, if S is the spin operator, which would be (ħ/2)σ, then Ay would be (ħ/2) * (ħ/2)σ? That doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says Ay = c·S, with c = h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix as given. So S is the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σy. So Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but the eigenvalues of σy are plus and minus 1, right? Because for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1. So if we have an operator that's a multiple of σy, the eigenvalues would be that multiple times ±1.

So let's compute the eigenvalues of Ay. The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by σy. So the eigenvalues a would be (h/(4π)) * (±1) = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalues of S (which is σy) are ±1. So when you multiply by c, the eigenvalues become c*(±1) = ±c. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π).

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part are ±2πh or ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π) or ±h/(4π). Wait, but the eigenvalues we found are purely real. Because σy has eigenvalues ±1, and c is real, so Ay's eigenvalues are real. So option A must be wrong because it mentions imaginary parts. So we can eliminate A.

Option B says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But again, our eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong because it's talking about imaginary parts, which don't exist here.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, I remember that when operators commute, they share eigenfunctions. A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. Since S is a spin operator, S² is (3/4)ħ² for spin 1/2, but let me think about the operators.

Wait, A is the intrinsic angular momentum operator, so A² is (something like) the sum of A_x, A_y, A_z squared. But in this case, the operator we're dealing with is Ay. The eigenfunctions of Ay would be eigenstates of S_y (since Ay is proportional to S_y), and A² is proportional to S·S which is Sx² + Sy² + Sz². Since S² is a scalar, the eigenfunctions of A² are all the possible states (since it doesn't depend on direction). So for a given eigenstate of Sy, it's also an eigenstate of S². So the eigenfunctions of Ay (which is proportional to Sy) are indeed eigenfunctions of A². But what about Az? Az is proportional to Sz. Since Sy and Sz don't commute, their eigenstates are not the same. So an eigenstate of Sy can't be an eigenstate of Sz. So the statement in option C is correct: the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator
