Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moments when the magnetic field changes. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have their magnetic moments related to their spin via the gyromagnetic ratio gamma. 

The problem says the particle's magnetic moment mu is gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. So when the field is on, the particle's magnetic moment aligns with it. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off in the Z direction and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. 

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. I need to find which option is correct: A to D.

Wait, so when the magnetic field is suddenly changed, the system will no longer be in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. I think this is a time-dependent perturbation problem, but maybe I can model it using the time evolution of the spin state under the new Hamiltonian.

Initially, when the field was along Z, the magnetic moment was aligned, so the spin was in an eigenstate of Sz. Let's say it was in the eigenstate |+z> because the magnetic moment aligns with B. When the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B', where B' is along Y. Since mu = gamma Sz, H becomes -gamma Sz * B in the Y direction. Wait, no, because B is along Y, vector-wise, so the dot product would be mu_y multiplied by B_y. Because mu is a vector, the components are mu_x, mu_y, mu_z.

Wait wait, mu = gamma S, right? So mu is a vector operator. So in the initial state, when B was along Z, the Hamiltonian was proportional to Sz. When B is turned off and a new B along Y is applied, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. 

So the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of Sz. But the new Hamiltonian H is proportional to Sy. Sy has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, which are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

So the initial state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of H. Thus, the time evolution will cause the state to oscillate between these states, leading to oscillations in observable quantities.

The average value of the z-component of the magnetic moment, <mu_z>, will oscillate because the state is a superposition of energy eigenstates. 

The frequency of this oscillation depends on the energy difference between the states. The energy eigenvalues for H are E_+ and E_-, where E_+ = (hbar something?), but wait, let's get more precise. 

The Hamiltonian when B is along Y is H = - mu · B = - (gamma Sz) * B in the Y direction. Wait, no: mu is gamma S, so mu · B would be gamma (S_x B_x + S_y B_y + S_z B_z). Since B is along Y, B_x = B_z =0, B_y = B. So H = - gamma B
