Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4.

Hmm, I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Let me think about each reaction step and what each reagent does.

First step: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. I think when a ketone reacts with bromine in a specific condition, it's probably undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, isn't that a bromohydrin formation? Oh wait, no, that's when you have a ketone reacting with bromine and water, but in this case, it's just bromine. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? No, that's more for alkenes. Oh wait, cyclohexanone can undergo a ring-opening reaction under certain conditions. Wait, no, bromine addition to a carbonyl group. Oh right, the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction adds bromine to the alpha position, but that's for alpha bromination. So cyclohexanone would get a bromine on the alpha carbon, making it 1-bromo-cyclohexanone or maybe 2-bromocyclohexanone. Wait, actually, cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons (each adjacent to the carbonyl), so adding bromine would add a Br to the alpha position(s). But how?

Wait, another possibility: when cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), I think it could undergo a ring-opening. Wait, no, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. Bromine addition might not do that. Alternatively, maybe it's an enolate formation. Wait, no, when you have a ketone and add a dienophile like Br2, perhaps it's an addition across the carbonyl. Oh wait, that's possible. So adding bromine to the carbonyl would result in a dihydroxybromide? No, wait, adding Br2 to a carbonyl might form a bromide. Let me think: cyclohexanone has the structure (CH2)5CO. When Br2 is added, perhaps it adds across the carbonyl group, like in a ketone. So it would become a dibromide, but wait, ketones don't usually do that. Oh, wait, maybe it's a bromide addition to the carbonyl, making a bromoalcohol or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromonium ion formation, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: looking up typical reactions of cyclohexanone with bromine. Oh, wait, I think that when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it can undergo an alpha bromination. So the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) get a bromine added. So cyclohexanone has two alpha positions (each CH2 next to the carbonyl), so adding Br would lead to 2-bromo-cyclohexanone. So product 1 is 2-bromocyclohexanone.

Wait, but wait, when cyclohexanone reacts with Br2, it's more likely to undergo a nucleophilic addition if there's a base, but if not, perhaps it's a bromide transfer. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is attacked by bromine. No, I think the alpha bromination is more likely if there's a Lewis acid catalyst, but
