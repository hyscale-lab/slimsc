Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in general relativity and differential geometry, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime, and from it, you can compute various properties like area, volume, etc.

The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like something related to a sphere, maybe? I'm a bit confused because the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh wait, maybe this is in polar coordinates? Because if x and y are coordinates, perhaps they're using something like r² = x² + y². Let me see, 4 - r², so r² = 4 when the denominator becomes zero, implying a radius of 2. Oh, right, so the denominator is 4 - r², and the metric is given in 2D, since dx² and dy² are involved. So this might represent a 2-sphere, but wait, actually, no, because for a regular sphere, the metric would involve sin terms or something else. Wait, maybe this is a conformally flat metric.

Wait, the metric is written as ds² = (some function) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). That's a conformal metric, right? Because it's just a scalar multiple of the flat metric. So the area element would be straightforward to compute. 

The area element in a metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this metric is diagonal, the determinant is just the product of the diagonal components. Let me see, the metric tensor here would be g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) )? No, wait, for a 2D metric, it's a 2x2 matrix, so determinant is g_xx * g_yy - g_xy^2. But since g_xy is zero, determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the square root of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy = (32)/(4 - x² - y²)
