Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm. Parallax and distance are related, right? Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. I remember the formula that distance d is equal to 1 over the parallax p, but wait, I think it's in parsecs. So d (in parsecs) = 1 / p. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies with 1/(plx^5). So N = k/(plx^5), where k is some constant. But how does this translate when we consider distance, since plx and distance are inversely related?

Let me think. Since d = 1/plx, that means plx = 1/d. So substituting that into the equation for N, we get N = k / ( (1/d)^5 ). Which simplifies to N = k * d^5. Oh wait, that's N proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So maybe it's about the density or the rate of change. Or perhaps it's looking for the differential relationship.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the number of stars per unit volume, but I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Suppose we have a region of the sky, and we're looking at the number of stars in that region as a function of distance. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface density multiplied by the area of the shell... but wait, surface density? Or maybe it's a different approach.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx = 1/d, this becomes N ∝ d^5. So for a given region, as d increases, N increases as d^5, which suggests that the number
