Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, like a strong peak around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, that's a clue that ester is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the splitting and number of signals can tell me about the substitution pattern. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, there are two sets of equivalent H's, which would show up as two singlets. Or maybe ortho or meta? Wait, but in 6-membered rings, substituents being para, meta, or ortho can change the NMR signals.

Wait, wait. But the aromatic signals here are two. So maybe each substituent is in a way that leads to two different sets of aromatic protons. For example, if one substituent is in position 1 and the other in position 3 (meta), then the ring could have two distinct aromatic signals. Alternatively, if it's para, but each substituent is different, maybe each substituent causes a different set of H's. Hmmm. Or maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring symmetry leads to two types of aromatic H's.

But I'm not sure yet, let's move on.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in an alkene. So, maybe the compound has two double bonds or a structure where vinyl protons are present. Alternatively, perhaps the ester group is part of a vinyl ester or something similar.

Wait, but the ester group is typically part of a carbonyl, not a double bond. Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent includes a vinyl group. Like an ester with a vinyl substituent, or maybe a substituent with a double
