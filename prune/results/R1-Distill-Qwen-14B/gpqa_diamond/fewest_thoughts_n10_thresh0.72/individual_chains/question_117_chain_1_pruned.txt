Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question asks which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism happens when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. 

The compounds given are four, numbered 1 to 4. Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, a biphenyl structure with substituents on each ring. The substituents are nitro groups at position 6 on each phenyl, and the carboxylate esters at position 2 on each. Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but does this lead to optical isomerism? I think if the substituents are in positions that allow for a plane of symmetry, they might not be chiral. Alternatively, if the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, then it's chiral. The positions here are 6 and 2. Let me visualize: each phenyl ring has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. The biphenyls are connected at 1 and 1'. So, each ring has substituents in such a way that maybe the entire molecule isn't symmetrical. Wait, but waitâ€”another possibility is that if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule have a center of symmetry. For example, if substituents are opposite each other, it could create a plane of symmetry. Oh, but in this case, the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6. Wait, I remember that on a benzene ring, position 2 is adjacent to the connecting point (like in biphenyl), so if both rings have substituents in positions 2 and 6, perhaps the molecule has a certain symmetry. Wait, if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, but the rings are connected at 1, then the substituents are at positions that are across from each other. Hmm, maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Or maybe not. Alternatively, if the substituents cause the molecule to not have a plane of symmetry, then it could have optical isomers. Alternatively
