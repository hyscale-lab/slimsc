Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in the same conditions. The particle moves along a tube (x-axis). The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a bit odd. I'm a bit confused because typically wave functions have real and imaginary parts, but I thought the normalization involves the integral of the square of the absolute value.

Wait, the question says that when they measured the position, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but this seems like a complex function, but I'm not sure if the imaginary part affects the probability distribution. Oh, right! The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So perhaps the imaginary part is part of the function.

Wait, but if the wave function is ψ(x) = A / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i, then the absolute square would be |ψ|² = (A/(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you take the absolute value of a complex number a + ib, it's sqrt(a² + b²), so the square is a² + b².

But wait, the wave function needs to be normalized. The integral of |ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Because all the probability is in that region.

So first, let's compute the normalization condition. The integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me write ψ(x) as (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - i*(0.5), because I think that's how the question presents it. So, the absolute square is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]² + (0.5)².

So |ψ|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

The integral of this from 1 to 3 must be 1. So,

∫₁³ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

We can split the integral into two parts:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1.

Let's compute each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The antiderivative of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x).

Evaluated from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 2 (since 3-1=2).

So the equation becomes:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1.

Simplify that:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a squared equals 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute that value numerically.

ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a squared is about 0.721, so a is sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849. Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.721) is roughly 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my steps. Because I might have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the wave
