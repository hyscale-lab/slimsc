Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question involves two reactions and asks which reagents A and B are suitable.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) and NaCN, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O), resulting in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what's happening in each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile group... I remember that nucleophilic addition reactions occur in ketones when they have alpha hydrogens. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So, maybe this is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

In the product, the nitrile group is added to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The
