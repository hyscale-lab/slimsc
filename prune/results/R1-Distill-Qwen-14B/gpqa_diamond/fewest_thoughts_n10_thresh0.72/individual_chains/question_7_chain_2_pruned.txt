Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The process given is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it fills the universe. Each photon has very low energy. So, the gamma-rays are high energy, and they're interacting with these low-energy CMB photons.

I think this has to do with the photon-photon interaction. When a high-energy photon interacts with a low-energy CMB photon, they can annihilate into electron-positron pairs if certain conditions are met. I remember something about threshold energy for pair production.

Wait, pair production requires that the combined energy of the two photons be at least twice the rest mass energy of the electron. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So, 2 * 0.511 MeV is 1.022 MeV. So, each photon's energy must sum up to at least 1.022 MeV for this process to happen, but that's when they're at rest. But in reality, photons are moving, so it's more about their center-of-momentum frame.

Wait, the process is gamma + photon → e+ e-. So in the lab frame where the CMB is at rest, the gamma-ray is moving and hits a CMB photon. The energy and momentum have to add up in such a way that the center-of-mass energy is at least 2m_e c².

Let me think about the cross-section and the interaction probability. The optical depth (τ) is the probability that a gamma-ray will interact via this process. The lifetime limit would be when the optical depth τ approaches 1, meaning that on average, a gamma-ray will have about one chance to interact in a given region.

The lifetime τ is given by τ = n_γ * σ * c * t, where n_γ is the number density of CMB photons, σ is the cross-section for the interaction, c is the speed of light, and t is the time.

But wait, I
