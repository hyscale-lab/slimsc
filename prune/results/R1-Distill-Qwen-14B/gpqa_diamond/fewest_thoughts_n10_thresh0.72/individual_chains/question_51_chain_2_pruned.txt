Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the setup is: a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with a different expression involving k, q squared, d, and R.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conducting spheres and charges, image charges come into play. Because the sphere is conducting and grounded, it should maintain an equilibrium where the electric potential on the surface is the same everywhere. Oh, right! For a grounded conducting sphere, any excess charge resides on the surface, and the sphere's potential is the same as the ground, which is considered zero.

So the problem involves the method of images. The charge q outside the sphere induces an image charge. Wait, but wait, the sphere is grounded, so does that affect the image charge? Hmm, I think for a grounded conducting sphere, the image charge is different. Oh right, because the sphere is at zero potential, the image charge would adjust accordingly.

Wait, when you have a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the method of images tells us that the sphere can be replaced by an image charge inside. But in this case, since the sphere is grounded, the image charge might be related to the radius R and the distance d.

Wait, the image charge q' for a sphere of radius R would be q' = -q*(R/d). Oh wait, no, that's when the sphere isn't grounded. Because when the sphere is ungrounded, the image charge is at a distance d' such that (d'^2 - R^2) = R^2/(d) or something like that? Maybe I should double-check that formula.

Wait, in the method of images, for a conducting sphere of radius R and a charge q located at a distance d from the center, the image charge is given by q' = - q R^2 / d^2. Wait, no, I think that's when the charge is outside the sphere. Wait, let me get this straight.

The image charge for a conducting sphere when a charge q is placed outside is q' = - (q R^2)/(d^2 - R^2) ? No, wait, that's not right. Or is it that when the sphere is
