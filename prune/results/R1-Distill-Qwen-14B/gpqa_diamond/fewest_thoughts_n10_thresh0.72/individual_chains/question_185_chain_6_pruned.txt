Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator given by H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I think I've seen something like this before. 

Alright, let me start by breaking it down. The Hamiltonian is a dot product of ε times a vector of Pauli matrices and another unit vector n. Wait, the Pauli spin matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? So their vector would be something like (σx, σy, σz), and n is a unit vector, so its components are like (n_x, n_y, n_z), each squared adding up to 1.

So when you take the dot product σ · n, you're doing σx * n_x + σy * n_y + σz * n_z. That makes sense. So the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2, right? And ε is an energy constant, so it has units of energy.

Now, the question is about the eigenvalues. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, Pauli matrices have specific properties. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, right? But when you take a linear combination, does that change things?

Let me think. The operator H can be written as ε multiplied by a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with the unit vector n. So H = ε (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz). Let me denote the vector of Pauli matrices as σ, so σ · n is the sum I mentioned.

The eigenvalues of σ · n would be... wait, because σ · n is a matrix, and its eigenvalues are determined by the properties of the Pauli matrices. But since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a traceless matrix (since each Pauli matrix is traceless, and the sum would also be traceless). The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, and zero for this matrix. So the eigenvalues should be +1 and -1, maybe?

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination, like σ · n, the eigenvalues might not just be ±1. Because σ · n is a sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by components of n
