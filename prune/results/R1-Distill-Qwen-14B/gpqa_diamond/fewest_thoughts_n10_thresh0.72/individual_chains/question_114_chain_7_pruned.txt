Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The first part says butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving A and B as different reagents.

Hmm. So I think the first reaction is some kind of substitution. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that in ketones, the alpha position is where substitution can happen. Wait, wait, but NaCN is a nucleophile, but under what conditions does it add to a ketone?

Oh wait, I think it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation! That's when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-) to form a 1,2-dihydroxy compound, but wait, no, wait. Cyanohydrin is a compound where the hydroxyl and cyanide groups are added to the alpha and beta carbons. So, for butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, adding CN- would add a hydroxyl group and a cyanide group to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN and a reagent A, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that: the structure would be CH2(C)(OH)(CN), but wait, let me think. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure is (CH(CH3)(OH))CH2CN?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The product is 2-hydroxy-
