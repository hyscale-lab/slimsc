Okay, so I have this physics question to tackle. Let me read it again. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these topics, but let's think through it. So regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are like these infinite terms that pop up in calculations, which are unphysical. Regularization helps to make these calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the infinities.

So the question is asking which theory doesn't need this regularization, meaning its calculations don't have these divergences when you go to high energies. Or maybe it's that the theory is finite, meaning it doesn't have these divergences to begin with, so you don't need to regularize.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. But isn't string theory supposed to be a background-independent theory? Wait, but also I think string theories require a lot of higher-dimensional aspects and maybe supersymmetry. Do they have divergences that need regularization? I'm not too sure. I think in string theory, the perturbative calculations (like loop expansions) might have divergences, but because strings are extended objects, maybe some of these divergences are tamed. Or perhaps they require regularization in the form of other methods. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I remember that in QCD, at high energies (or equivalently, at short distances), the coupling becomes weak due to asymptotic freedom. So perturbation theory works there. But when you calculate loop diagrams (like in beta functions), you get divergences. Those need to be regularized. So QCD does require regularization. So B is probably not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-understood theory and is a U(
