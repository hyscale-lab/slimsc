Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons colliding and annihilating into photons. Hmm, I've studied a bit about this before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me think through this.

Alright, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and one is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, so Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma is the factor by which time and length dilate for the moving object. So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron has gamma_p=2. Since the positron is moving from the right, perhaps its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electron's?

In any case, when they annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since they produce two photons, their energies and momenta must add up correctly.

Photons carry energy E = hf = pc, since for photons, E = pc. So each photon's momentum is E/(c), but direction matters. So the momenta are vectors.

Wait, but since both photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same. So if I denote the angle of each photon with the horizontal axis, then their momentum vectors would be (E/c) * (cos(theta), sin(theta)) for one, and (E/c) * (cos(phi), sin(phi)) for the other. Since both are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their angles are in the right half-plane, so their x-components are positive.

Wait, but the photons are moving in upper-right and lower-right. So their angles are measured from the positive x-axis (since the electron was moving along the positive x from the left, positron from the right, so their initial direction is along the x-axis). So one photon goes up-right, the other down-right.

Wait, but both are moving to the right? Because the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So when they collide (head-on), they annihilate into two photons. Hmm, but the problem says both photons are moving in the right direction?
