Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a specific state. Hmm.

Alright, let me read the problem again. So, we have a NN (two nucleon) system in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about that. Oh right, Pauli's exclusion principle implies that the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric for identical fermions. So, the product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts must be antisymmetric. But since we're dealing with identical particles, the isospin comes into play here. But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So the isospin is zero. The question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

The options are reactions where the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is something else plus a particle (like p, s, etc.), each with specific quantum numbers. I need to figure out which of these is not allowed.

First, let's parse the initial state. The 1S0 state. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would mean S=0, L=0 (since S is 0, 2S+1=1; L is S in this notation? Wait, no. Let me think: the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L J. So the first number is 2S+1, which is 1 here. So S=0. Then L would be S? Wait, no, S is the spin. Oh, the initial state is 1S0. So 1 is (2S+1), so S=0. The L here is S? Wait, no, no. Wait, the term is 1S0. So the S here is the orbital angular momentum part. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify.

Wait, the term symbol is (2S+
