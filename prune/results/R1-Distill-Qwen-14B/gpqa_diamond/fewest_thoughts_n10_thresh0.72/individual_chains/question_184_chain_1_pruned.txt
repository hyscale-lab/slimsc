Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. And there are four options, A through D, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule to visualize it. The structure is benzene with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think: the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene with those groups.

Now, I need to plan the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene. I'll have to perform a series of substitution reactions because benzene typically undergoes electrophilic substitution.

Let me list the substituents we need to add: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro. The order in which these are added matters because the directing effects of each group will influence where the next substituent attaches.

Wait, but wait a minute. The substituents can either be activating or deactivating, and they can be ortho/para or meta directors. Let me think about each group:

- tert-Butyl group: it's a bulky alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating (they donate electrons through the sigma bond) and are ortho/para directors. So when adding a new group after this, the incoming electrophile will attack at ortho or para to the tert-butyl.

- Ethoxy group: this is an ether, which is an activating group (since the lone pairs on oxygen can donate electrons through resonance) and also an ortho/para director. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an electron-donating group. Wait, no, wait: actually, wait, no. Wait, the ethoxy group is an activating group, yes, because the lone pairs on oxygen can activate the ring. So it's an activating, ortho/para director.

- Nitro group: this is a strong deactivating group (electron-withdrawing) and is a meta director. So any substituent added after a nitro group would come in the meta position relative to it.

But the nitro group is a meta director when it's present, so if we add nitro after certain groups, the position where it adds will be determined by the existing substituents.

But let me think about the target molecule. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So in the benzene ring, that's a 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro group. Wait, no, the positions are 1, 2, 3: so that's a meta arrangement for the ethoxy and nitro groups, but adjacent for ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, no, perhaps I should number it correctly. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and the nitro at position 3. So that would make the ethoxy and tert-butyl adjacent (ortho), and the nitro adjacent to the tert-butyl and the ethoxy. Hmm, but when substituents are added, their directing effects could complicate things.

But perhaps the order in which we add the substituents matters a lot. Let me outline the possible steps.
