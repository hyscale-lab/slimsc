Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, butan-2-one is methylacetone, right? So it's (CH3)2CO. When ketones react with hydrogen cyanide or its salts, I remember that it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, NaCN is the source of CN- ions. So in a ketone, the carbonyl group is attacked by the cyanide ion. But the product here is a hydroxy nitrile. Wait, isn't that a specific kind of addition?

Wait, I think when a ketone reacts with HCN (or its equivalent like NaCN in an acid condition), it forms a cyanohydrin. Oh right, a cyanohydrin is when the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, and a hydroxyl group also adds, making a geminal diol or something similar. But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Hmm, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Oh wait, maybe the starting material is different. Or perhaps I got the carbon count wrong. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons in the chain. The product is butanenitrile, so four carbons. Hmm, maybe the reaction isn't a simple addition but something else.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Wait, no, ketones typically don't undergo nucleophilic substitution. Oh wait, wait! Maybe it's an addition followed by elimination? No, that would typically give an alkene.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A producing a hydroxy nitrile. So, the product has a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon. So the reaction is a cyanohydrin formation. For that, I think the conditions are acidic. Because the addition of HCN to ketones usually uses an acid catalyst.

So, NaCN alone wouldn't provide the acid. So reagent A must be an acid, like H3O+ (which is H+ from H3O+). So in the first reaction, A would be H3O+ as the catalyst.

Wait, but in the options, looking at A and B, for option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option C has A as NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but for cyanohydrin formation, the mechanism is that the ketone reacts with HCN in the presence of an acid catalyst. HCN is a weak acid, so the reaction might not proceed without a catalyst. So NaCN plus H3O+ would provide the H+ needed to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack.

So in reaction 1, reagent A is H3O+.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. That's a mouthful. Let me see, butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile on the fourth. The 2-position has a hydroxyl group and a substituent (4-benzylphenyl). So structure-wise, it's (PhCH2Ph)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe it's (PhCH2Ph) attached to the second carbon, which is also attached to OH and CH2-CN.

The reagent is B, which is H2O. And the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group has been converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does that happen? Oh, I think that's the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to produce carboxylic acids or amines, depending on the reagent.

In this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the conditions are likely acidic. So the nitrile is hydrolyzed in the presence of water and an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O. So perhaps the reaction uses H2O along with a strong acid. Wait, but the reagents are given as B: H2O, but the question says B is H2O. Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid. So in the second step, the reagent is probably a strong acid like HCl or maybe something else.

Wait, the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. So for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, I think it's usually done under strong acidic conditions, maybe with HCl as the catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes H2O and H+ are used.

Wait, another thought: The reaction is the hydrolysis of nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The common way is to treat nitriles with H2O in the presence of HCl (as a catalyst), under reflux. So in this case, reagent B would be HCl. So looking at the options, for the second reaction (reagent B), B is HCl. So looking at the options, option A has B=HCl, option C has B=HCl.

Wait, let me recap:

Reaction 1: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile

Reagent A is H3O+ because it's the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation.

Reaction 2: 2-(...)nitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(...)butanoic acid.

Reagent B is HCl, because the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid requires acid, like HCl.

So looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option C is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Wait, but NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it's Na+ and HSO3^- which can donate a proton). So in reaction 1, could A be NaHSO3 instead of H3O+?

Wait, both would provide H+ as a catalyst. So the first reaction could have either H3O+ or NaHSO3 as the acid. So looking at the options, which one fits?

Option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.

Option C: A is NaHSO3, B is HCl.

So if reaction 1 uses either, but reaction 2 uses HCl, then options A and C are possible.

Wait, but the second reaction's reagent is B, which is HCl. So in the first reaction, A could be either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

In reaction 1, the product is a cyanohydrin. The conditions for that are usually acid-catalyzed, but could be either H3O+ or another acid like H2SO4, or NaHSO3 (which is a source of H+ and sulfite ions). Hmm, but does NaHSO3 act as a catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation?

Alternatively, perhaps in the first reaction, NaCN and a strong acid like H3O+ are used. So reagent A is H3O+. Then, in the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

So looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+, B=HCl.

But wait, another possibility. The first reaction uses NaCN and H3O+ as the reagent, so A is H3O+.

The second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to acid. So, if reagent B is H2O, but H2O alone isn't enough. Wait, no, the question says that in the second reaction, reagent B is H2O, but the product is the acid. So perhaps B is a catalyst, like HCl is present in the mixture. Or maybe B is HCl, but the setup in the question says that reagent B is H2O. Hmm, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the second reaction is written as:

... + B (H2O) → ...

Wait, no, the question says B is (H2O). So the reaction is in the presence of H2O and another reagent B. Maybe B is the acid?

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let me reread the question.

The second reaction is:

... + B (H2O) → ... 

Wait, perhaps it's written as B being H2O, but perhaps the reaction is done in the presence of H2O and another reagent. Or perhaps B is an acid, and the solvent is H2O.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis using H2O as the solvent, and B is an acid catalyst.

So, for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl, and the solvent is H2O. So the setup would be that in the reaction, B is HCl, but the "H2O" is the solvent.

Wait, but the way the question is written is that the second reaction uses reagent B, which is H2O. Hmm, that's making it a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So, for reaction 1, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Reaction 2: B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

If I proceed under the assumption that in the second reaction, the reagent is HCl (as the catalyst for hydrolysis), then the correct options would be either A or C.

So, let's think about reaction 1 again. If A is NaHSO3, what is that? It's sodium bisulfite, which provides H+ and SO3^2- ions. Would that work as a catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the typical catalyst is H+ from an acid like H3O+ or H2SO4.

So perhaps in reaction 1, A must be H3O+. So that would rule out options C and D, leaving A and B.

In reaction 2, the conversion from nitrile to carboxylic acid would need strong acid conditions. So HCl is a strong acid, so B would be HCl. That would mean option A is the correct one because it has B=HCl.

But wait, the second reaction's reagent is labeled as B, which is written as (H2O). Wait, perhaps I misread it. Let me check again.

The second reaction is written as:

...nitrile + B (H2O) → ... acid.

Oh, wait, perhaps H2O is the solvent and B is the acid. So for the second reaction, B is the acid reagent. So for the hydrolysis, the acid is HCl, which is reagent B.

So in the second reaction, B is HCl, which is present in the reaction. So the correct option would have B= HCl.

Looking at options, that would be options A and C.

Now, considering reaction 1: which reagent, H3O+ or NaHSO3, would be correct?

I think the cyanohydrin formation uses HCN with an acid catalyst. So NaCN in presence of H3O+ would provide the H+ needed. So A is H3O+.

Therefore, the correct option is option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: sometimes, when NaHSO3 is used, it can act as a source of H+ and also as a sulfonating agent. But in the first reaction, we don't see any sulfonate group in the product. So perhaps H3O+ is more appropriate as the catalyst.

Thus, the correct answer would be option A.


The problem involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **Reaction 1**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, which typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this reaction, as it provides the necessary H⁺ for the acid-catalyzed mechanism. While NaHSO₃ could also provide H⁺, it is less commonly used for this specific reaction.

2. **Reaction 2**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in the presence of H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid, which typically requires strong acidic conditions. HCl is a strong acid and is commonly used as a catalyst for this reaction, making it the most suitable choice for reagent B.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for Reaction 1, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to effectively catalyze the hydrolysis in Reaction 2.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ could provide H⁺, but it is less suitable for Reaction 1 compared to H₃O⁺.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Both reagents are unsuitable for their respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
