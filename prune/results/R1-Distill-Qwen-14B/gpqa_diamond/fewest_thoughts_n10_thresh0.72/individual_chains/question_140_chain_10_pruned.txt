Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, so the question is a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the problem starts with substance X reacting violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Then, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and X has isotopes with heavier elements.

Let me think about each part.

First, identifying substance X. It's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope. Common reagents include things like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, maybe HNO3 or something else. Wait, but what about something like H2O2? No, that's more of an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, think about something like sodium or potassium? No, maybe not. Wait, another thought: what about something like Li or Na? No, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, looking at the reaction: X reacts with a liquid Y to produce gas W. Gas W's molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So, let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 neutrons (oxygen has 8, two hydrogens have 0 each) but that's 8 neutrons and 2+8=10 protons. Not equal. Or CO2: 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. CO2 has 6 protons (C) and 8 each for O, so total 6 + (8*2) = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 (C) has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + (8*2) = 22. Neutrons are 6 + (8*2) = 22. Wait, so protons are 22, neutrons 22. So that's equal. So W could be CO2. Alternatively, what else? Could it be NH3? Let's see: NH3 has 14 (N) + 3(1
