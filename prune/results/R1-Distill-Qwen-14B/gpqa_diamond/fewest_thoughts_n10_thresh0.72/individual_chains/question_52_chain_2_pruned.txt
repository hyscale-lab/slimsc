Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When there are spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes between when the star has no spots and when it does. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. They also mention that the photosphere is in LTE, so I can use the Boltzmann equation.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots is the factor we're looking for.

Wait, but the spots are cooler regions, right? Because they are dark, so they are emitting less light. When spots cover part of the star's surface, the overall effective temperature measured from the star is lower because the spots are cooler. But does this affect the photospheric temperature where the Ti lines are formed?

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the entire photosphere's average temperature is lower? Or is the spot temperature lower, but the surrounding is higher? Hmm, perhaps the star's overall Teff is an average, but the photosphere where the lines form might be at a certain temperature. Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the
