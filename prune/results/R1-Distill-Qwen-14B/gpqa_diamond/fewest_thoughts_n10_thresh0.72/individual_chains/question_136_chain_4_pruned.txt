Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r² and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Oh right, so the vector field is purely radial, which might simplify things.

I remember from my notes that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by a certain formula. Since the field is radial, the divergence should be easier to calculate. The general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field F(r) that's purely radial is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r). So in this case, F_r is 1/r².

Let me plug that in. So, ∇·f would be (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Simplify the inside first: r²*(1/r²)=1. So, taking the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Wait, so the divergence is zero?

Wait, that can't be right. Because if that's the case, then the integral over any volume would be zero. But wait, what about at the origin? Oh, because the vector field is 1/r², which has a singularity at r=0. So maybe there's something about the divergence theorem here.

Wait, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. So, ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ f · dA over the surface.

Hmm, so if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the volume integral would be zero. But wait, what about the delta function at the origin? Because if f(r) behaves like an inverse square law, like electric fields, then the divergence would be a delta function at the origin.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's re-examine the divergence calculation. So ∇·f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * f(r)). Here, f(r) is 1/r², so r² f(r) is 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero, so ∇·f is zero. So the integral over any volume not including the origin would be zero. But if the sphere includes the origin, does that change things?

Wait, but in the problem statement, the sphere is centered at the origin. So for R>0, the sphere definitely includes the origin. How does that affect the divergence? Let me think about the delta function. For an inverse square field, the divergence is proportional to the delta function: ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). Because, for example, in electrostatics, Gauss's law says that ∇·E = ρ/ε₀, and for a point charge, ρ is a delta function.

So, if f(r) is like an electric field, which is 1/r², then ∇·f should be 4π δ³(r). Therefore, the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R would be ∫∫∫ (4π δ³(r)) dV. The integral
