Okay, so I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see what I remember. Equilibrium temperature is how warm a planet is, right? It's based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh, and it's also affected by the planet's albedo, which is how much light it reflects. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part is the same for both. That should cancel out in the ratio.

The question gives a lot of data. Let's parse it. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, effective temperature 6300 K. The two planets: Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

They detected these planets using transit and radial velocity methods. Oh, but wait, the question is about equilibrium temperature, so maybe the detection methods aren't directly relevant except for the data they give about the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] and the Doppler shifts. Hmm, how does that tie into the problem?

Wait, those shifts must relate to the planets' orbital parameters. The RV method measures the Doppler shift, which tells us the mass and orbit. The transit method measures the drop in brightness when the planet passes in front, giving radius and orbit. But in this question, the relevant data is probably about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet.

Wait, the problem says that Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. And Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 Å. Oh, so these are the Doppler shifts, which relate to the RV method. The RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )) ) * (1/(c)) ?

Wait, maybe I should think about Kepler's third law. The orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a
