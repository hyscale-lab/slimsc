Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to find the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A to D, with numbers 4, 7, 8, or 10.

Let me start by understanding each step.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I remember bicyclo structures—like norbornene, right? The [2.2.1] part means two fusing bridges, maybe? So, it's a bicyclic compound with a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. The substituent is probably a bulky group because tert-butoxy is a big, bulky ether.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. So, this sounds like an elimination reaction. Wait, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Because the starting material has a diene, and the other reagent is a dienophile?

Wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Let me draw that mentally. So cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene—so positions 1-2 double bond and 3-4 double bond. Then, at positions 5 and 6 (adjacent to the double bonds?), there are dibromomethyl groups. So each of those positions has a CH2 group where each CH2 has two Br atoms attached. Wait, no—dibromomethyl would be a CH2Br2 group. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 substituent.

When you have dibromomethyl groups and you use a base, maybe like NaI, it's a common setup for elimination reactions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with two equivalents, maybe each dibromomethyl group undergoes substitution.

Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo diene. So if I have
