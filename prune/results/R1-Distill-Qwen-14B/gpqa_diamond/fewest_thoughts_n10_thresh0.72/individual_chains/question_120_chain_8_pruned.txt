Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. The formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. I think this relates to how stars are distributed in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means their number density is constant in space. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

Wait, but parallax is a measure of distance. So if I consider a thin shell at a distance d, which corresponds to a parallax plx = 1/d, the thickness of the shell would be a small change in distance, say dd. The volume of this shell would be approximately 4πd² * dd. Because the volume of a sphere is 4/3 π r³, so the surface area is 4π r², and multiplying by thickness gives the volume of the shell.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. So I think we need to express the number of stars in a thin shell in terms of parallax. Let's see. The number of stars N in the shell would be the number density (n) times the volume. If the number density is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, then N = n * 4πd² dd.

But wait, plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So d = 1/plx, and dd would be the change in d. Let's write dd in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, wait, because plx is inversely proportional to d. So when plx increases, d decreases. So maybe I can express dd in terms of d plx.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to change variables from d to plx. Let's try that. So, if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. The volume of the shell in terms of plx would be 4π
