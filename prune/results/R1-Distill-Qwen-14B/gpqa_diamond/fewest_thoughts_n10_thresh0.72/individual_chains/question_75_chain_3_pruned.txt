Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me read it carefully.

So, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the role of GADD45G protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a construct where the coding sequence of GADD45G is modified by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic-resistant colonies. But the problem is they can't overexpress the protein as expected.

The given sequence is the plus strand of their construct. They noticed an issue and the question is about why they can't overexpress the protein.

Looking at the options:

A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.
B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.
C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.
D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.

Hmm, I need to figure out what's wrong with the construct based on the provided sequence.

First, let me think about the structure of the sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then, after that, the next codons should be the hemagglutinin tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, but maybe there's a stop codon somewhere in the middle, causing the translation to terminate early. Let me check the sequence for any in-frame stop codons.

The sequence provided is the coding (sense) strand. Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons (which are stop codons on the mRNA, but as they're the plus strand, I think the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T for U).

Wait, actually, the coding strand has the same sequence as mRNA, except T instead of U. So in the coding strand, a stop codon would be TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Let me scan the sequence. Let's see: ATG... then the rest.

Looking through the sequence:

Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let's go step by step.

Looking for TGA: There's a TGA near the end. Let me check.
