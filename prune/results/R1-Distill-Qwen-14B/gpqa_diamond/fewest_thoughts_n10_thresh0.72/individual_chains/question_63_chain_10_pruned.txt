Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states after absorbing a photon. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I studied.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. So, the molecule has two atoms, X and Y, with masses 20 amu and 2 amu respectively. The bond length is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration is 4e14 rad/s.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be the first vibrational level and the lowest rotational state. Wait, or is it that the fundamental state is considered the ground state, which might include both rotation and vibration? I think in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. So the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0, but not sure).

Wait, no. I think the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotational and vibrational energies. The energy levels are given by E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0 and J=0.

The question is asking what momentum the absorbed photon should have so that the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state after the fundamental would be the next possible energy level. But wait, what's the order of energy levels? Vibrational energy levels are higher in spacing than rotational, right? Because the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2) hν, where ν is the frequency. Rotational levels are (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), so each step in J increases energy by a certain amount.

So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be the next lowest energy state. But what's the next state? It could be either the first vibrational excited state (v=1) or the first rotational state (J=1). Which one has lower energy?

Wait, let me think about the energy differences. The vibrational energy levels have a spacing of hν, while the rotational energy levels have a spacing of (J+1) * something. Let's see: the energy of a rotational state J is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. So the spacing between J=0 (which is E=0) and J=1 is E=2B. For the vibrational state, the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is hν.

So which is smaller, hν or 2B? If hν is smaller than 2B, then the next state would be vibrational. If not, then it's rotational.

So I need to calculate both hν and 2B. Let's compute.

First, calculate B. The moment of inertia I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, r is bond length.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I should convert amu to kg for calculations. 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ let's calculate that. 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then B is ħ²/(2I). ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.207e-46) ) = let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 ≈ 2.414e-46.

So B ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) ≈ 4.607e-23 J.

Wait, that seems off. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the exponents. Let me recompute:

I = μ r² = (1.818 amu) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait no, I already converted μ to kg: approximately 3.018e-27 kg. So I = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m². That seems right.

Then, B = (ħ^2)/(2I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.207e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 = approx 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.414e-46) ≈ 4.607e-23 J. Hmm, that's a very small number, but let's see.

Wait, but the rotational energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is 2B. So 2B is approx 9.214e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is hν. h is Planck's constant, approx 6.626e-34 J·s. ν is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So hν = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now, compare 2B (9.214e-23 J) and hν (2.6504e-19 J). Oh wait,
