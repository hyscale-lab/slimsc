Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. But let's take it step by step.

The question says that there's a mixture of two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 ratio. Each has the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. There are also three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present based on the options given.

Hmm, first thing I remember is that NMR signals can tell us about the structure of the molecule. The aromatic region around 6.7 ppm suggests substitution patterns on the benzene ring. The downfield shift there could be due to electron-withdrawing groups, but wait, these are all methyl groups, which are electron-donating. So maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, in aromatic regions, the substitution pattern affects the chemical shifts. For example, para-substituted rings usually have a different shift than ortho or meta.

Wait, but wait. The compounds given are all tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. So that's two different structures there.

Let me think about the NMR data. For the aromatic region, two singlets at 6.7 ppm. Each is a singlet, which means no neighboring protons. So each of these singlets must come from a set of equivalent aromatic protons that have no adjacent Hs.

Wait, but wait, how can a benzene ring have only one set of equivalent aromatic protons? That would imply a highly symmetric structure. Let's think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene (that's like a 1,2,3,4-tetra arrangement, which is a para substitution on adjacent positions. Wait, but that would be a 1,2,3,4-tetra, maybe a 4-methyl group arrangement? No, wait, wait. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have four methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4. That would make a structure where the ring has
