Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them. So Y must be an element that can form multiple fluorides. Elements that form several fluorides... Hmm, maybe something like sulfur, which can form SF2, SF4, SF6, etc. Or perhaps chlorine? Wait, no, I think sulfur is more likely because I remember compounds like SF6 being pretty common.

The problem describes several substances A1 through A5. Let's go through each one.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is probably a strong oxidizing agent. When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 (which has an oF (oxidation state of fluorine) of 31.96%) and F2. Wait, the oF value is 31.96%, which as a fraction would be roughly 0.3196. Hmm, what's the oxidation state of fluorine in A2?

Wait, fluorine usually has an oxidation state of -1. But if A2 is a binary compound with Y and F, and the oF is 31.96%, that might be the percentage of fluorine by mass or the oxidation state. Wait, no, the question says ɷF=31,96%—probably that's the oxidation state. Wait, oxidation states are usually integers, so 31.96% might imply something else. Wait, perhaps it's the percentage of fluorine by mass? Because 31.96% as a mass percentage could relate to the fluorine content.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me think about the decomposition of A1. When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So, the reaction might be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Since fluorine is being released, perhaps A1 has more fluorine in a higher oxidation state. For example, if A1 is a higher fluoride, like YF5, which upon decomposition forms YF3 (A2) and F2, but I'm not sure
