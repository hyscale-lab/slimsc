Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, which probably means we can ignore kinetic energy contributions. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. Right, so since all the charges are the same and the system is isolated, the potential energy would be due to the interactions between all these charges. But wait, the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are at a fixed distance from P. So I think the setup is that the 13th charge is at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of those 12 is 2 meters away from P, but how about their distances from each other?

Wait, the problem says each of the 12 is constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. That means each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P, but I don't know their arrangement. Oh wait, but they're all at the same distance from P, so maybe they form a regular dodecahedron or something around P? But wait, the arrangement that minimizes the potential energy would probably have the charges as far apart as possible. Wait, but waitâ€”wait, wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. For point charges, the potential energy is a combination of all pairwise interactions. But since all the charges are positive (since each is 2e), they repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, you want to arrange them as far apart as possible. But if they are fixed at 2 meters from P, perhaps their positions can't be changed beyond that. Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, which I think means their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2 m around P. But I'm not sure if their exact positions on the sphere affect the potential energy. 

Wait, since all the charges are identical and the system is symmetric, maybe the potential energy depends only on the distances from each other. But if they're all at the same radius
