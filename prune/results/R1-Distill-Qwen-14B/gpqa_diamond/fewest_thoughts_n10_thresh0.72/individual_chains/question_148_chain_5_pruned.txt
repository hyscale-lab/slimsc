Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the molecular weight range of substance A4. Hmm, let me start by breaking down what the question is saying.

So, there are five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. I know that binary compounds consist of two elements, so Y and F. The compounds are A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. 

The first clue: A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So, the decomposition reaction would look something like A1 → A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if it's being oxidized, that suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. I'm thinking maybe A1 is a fluorine compound that's quite reactive.

Next, A3 can interact with xenon too. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So, when Y reacts with fluorine, it forms A3. Wait, but Y is the other element in these binary compounds, so maybe Y is in a lower oxidation state in A3? Or perhaps higher. Hmm.

Then, adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot concentrated solution of A4 gives A5. When A5 is in water, it decomposes into two substances. So, A5 might be a salt that undergoes hydrolysis. Let me think about possible reactions.

Let me try to identify Y. Since we're dealing with binary fluorides, Y could be something like oxygen, sodium, or maybe another element. Wait, but fluorine is a halogen, so Y is likely another element that forms multiple fluorides.

Wait, looking at the decomposition of A1: if A1 breaks down into A2 and F2, maybe A1 is a diatomic molecule of a higher fluoride. For example, perhaps A1 is ClF3 or something, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, fluorine is in the compounds, so perhaps A1 is a polyatomic fluoride.

Wait, another approach: A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas. So, A1 should be a strong oxidizer. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but in which compounds does it appear? For example, F2 itself is a strong oxidizer, but it's diatomic. But A1 is a binary compound, so maybe it's a compound like OF2, but that's not a binary compound of Y and F. Wait, the problem says five binary compounds, so Y is a single element, and each compound is YF_x.

So Y is the same element in all, and the compounds are YF, YF2, YF3, etc. So Y must be an element that forms multiple fluorides. For example, chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Wait, but chlorine has multiple fluorides, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, oxygen forms OF2 and O2F2, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe Y is sodium? No, sodium only forms NaF, I think. Maybe Y is sulfur? S
