Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. I need to figure out which one is correct based on the given data.

Let me break down the data:

1. **FTIR Spectrum:**
   - Very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's a very broad peak, could it be an alcohol (-OH) or maybe an acid? Alternatively, maybe another type of O-H like in a phenol? Hmm, but phenols have a broad peak too, but maybe not as broad as carboxylic acids. Or perhaps it's an alcohol. I'm not sure yet; I'll have to consider that.

   - There are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong area. I think that could be a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1700 is typical for things like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, perhaps an conjugated one or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. Alternatively, maybe an amide, but that's not relevant here since the options don't have N. Wait, the options have O but not N. So maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Or possibly an aromatic ring with a substituent that has a C=O.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum:**
   - Several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H's are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe part of a ring or an isolated double bond.

3. **Mass Spectrometry:**
   - Fragment peak at m/z 45. So I should think about what fragment corresponds to 45. Common fragments include CH3O (but that's 31), maybe CH2O (but that's 30), or something else. Wait, 45 is the mass of C3H7O? Let me think. 45 could be (CH3)2O which is 31, no. Or maybe OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, 45 is the molecular weight. Wait, 45 is the mass of the fragment. Let me think of possible fragments that add up to 45. The molecular formula options are C6H12O2, etc.

Wait, another approach: 45 is a common mass for the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91... Hmm. Wait, maybe it's the CH2CO (45) fragment. Or perhaps it's the loss of a larger group. Alternatively, the molecular ion breaking into smaller parts.

Wait, perhaps the unknown compound is an ester. Let's think about esters. Because esters have both carbonyl groups. The IR at 1700 and 1650 could fit an ester. Because esters typically have two carbonyl peaks. Wait, no, esters usually have a single carbonyl around ~1735 cm⁻¹. Wait, but maybe if it's conjugated or something else. Oh, wait, sometimes when there's conjugation, the carbonyl peak might be lower. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester would have a lower wavenumber, maybe around 1700. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe one of the carbonyls is an ester and the other is a ketone or something else. But the two peaks are both strong. So maybe it's an ester and a conjugated double bond. Or perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which might have a lower carbonyl peak.

Wait, another point: the FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000. That's characteristic of O-H groups. So the compound likely has an O-H. So that could be an alcohol or a phenol or a carboxylic acid. But the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So maybe it's an aromatic compound with a double bond.

Wait, let's think about the possible formulas:

Options are:

A) C6H12O2: Degrees of unsaturation? Let's calculate. Each degree of unsaturation is one double bond or ring. The formula is C6H12O2.

The formula for degrees of unsaturation (DoU) is: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. X and N are zero here.

So, (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1 DoU. So one ring or double bond.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate:

Actually, the formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So one DoU. That could be one ring, or one double bond, or a combination.

But wait, the 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the structure has at least one double bond. So DoU for A is 1, which would require another double bond or ring. Hmm, but that might not add up. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, for C6H12O2: The general formula for a saturated compound is CnH2n+2Ox. So for n=6, it's C6H14Ox. But with two oxygens, perhaps. So if the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone), for example, which would have a ring and a double bond? Or maybe a cyclic ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond elsewhere. But
