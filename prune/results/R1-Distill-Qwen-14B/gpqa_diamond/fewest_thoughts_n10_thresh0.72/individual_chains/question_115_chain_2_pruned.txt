Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

An electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is coming from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and in this case, it's two. Since the problem says the energies are the same, each photon has the same energy. 

Wait, but in annihilation, conservation laws must apply—conservation of energy and momentum. So, I think I need to look at the total momentum before annihilation and set that equal to the total momentum after, which would be the sum of the two photons' momenta.

Let me start by recalling some concepts. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, we'll probably need to use relativistic momentum and energy.

The electron and positron each have their own momenta. Since they're moving towards each other, their momenta will be in opposite directions. So maybe I should calculate their relativistic momenta and then sum them for the total.

Wait, but let me think about their directions. The electron is moving to the right (from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right), so their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total initial momentum is the sum of their momenta vectors, taking direction into account.

So, first, I'll compute the relativistic momentum for each.

For the electron: gamma_e = 4. Its rest mass is m_e (electron mass). So the momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Wait, but wait, actually, relativistic momentum is p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, I can express it in terms of energy. Since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so p = sqrt(E²/c² - m² c²)/c. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute using
