Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I know that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets and studying the universe's expansion. The question is about whether a star can be detected based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a one-hour exposure.

The condition is S/N of at least 10 per binned pixel. So I need to figure out for each star option whether the S/N meets this.

I remember that the S/N ratio depends on several factors: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency. Also, the star's distance affects its apparent brightness, which is crucial.

The formula I think is: S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / noise. But I'm not exactly sure. Wait, another approach is using the magnitude system. The S/N is proportional to the square root of the number of photons detected.

The star's apparent magnitude (m) is key here. A lower m means a brighter star and higher S/N.

To find m, I can use the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is the absolute magnitude, and d is the distance in parsecs.

So for each star, I'll calculate m and then see if it's bright enough for the S/N to reach 10.

Let me list the stars:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a bright star. Let me recall, Canopus is one of the brightest stars in the sky. I think its apparent magnitude is around -0.7 or something like that. So that's very bright.

b) Polaris: Polaris is the North Star. I remember it's not extremely bright; maybe around magnitude 2 or so, but I'm not certain. I think it's about 1.8 to 2.0.

c) Star with V=15 mag, 10 pc away: Using the distance modulus, m = 15 + 5 log(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15. So apparent magnitude 15. That's quite faint. I wonder if ESPRESSO can get S/N 10 on such a star in an hour.

d) Same star, but 200 pc away. m = 15 +5 log(200/10) = 15 +5 log(20). Log(20) is ~1.301, so 5*1.301 is 6.505. So m=15+6.505=21.505. That's way too faint.

e) Same star, 5 pc away. m =15 +5 log(5/10) =15 +5 log(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.301)=15
