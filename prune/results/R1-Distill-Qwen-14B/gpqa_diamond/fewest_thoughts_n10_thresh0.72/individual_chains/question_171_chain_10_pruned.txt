Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reaction of six different benzene derivatives with bromine in excess. The goal is to arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield. I have to choose from the given options A to D.

Hmm, electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic rings are influenced by the substituents already present. The substituents can activate or deactivate the ring and can direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions—either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, so each substituent will direct the incoming Br+ group to certain positions. But since the reaction is with excess bromine, I think it's a case of mono-bromination, but wait, wait. Oh, no, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, that's not possible because some substituents can lead to multiple products. Hmm, perhaps the question is about the regiochemistry of the substitution—meaning where the bromine adds on the ring relative to the existing substituent.

So each of the six compounds is undergoing bromination, leading to mono-substituted products. The yield of the para-isomer would depend on how the substituent directs the incoming Br. Let me think about each substituent:

1. C6H5-CH3 (toluene): The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So bromine can add in ortho, para, or maybe meta? Wait, no, methyl is activating. So the major products would be ortho and para. But since the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction, I need to compare the amount of para product for each compound.

2. C6H5-COOC2H5 (phenyl acetate): The ester group (COOEt) is a meta-directing group because it's an electron-withdrawing group. So the incoming Br would add mainly in the meta position relative to the ester. So para would be a minor product here.

Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group by induction but can be activating via resonance if it's an -O- group. Wait, no, the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because the oxygen is connected to an alkyl group. So, the ester is a deactivating, meta-directing substituent. So, when bromine adds, it would add meta to the ester. So the para product would be minimal, but wait, wait—it's the existing substituent on the benzene. The substituent is in a specific position.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each substituent's directing effect:

Let me list each compound and its substituent:

1) -CH3 (methyl): activating, ortho/para-directing.

2) -COOEt (ester): deactivating, meta-directing.

3) -Cl: deactivating (since Cl is more electronegative), but ortho/para-directing. Wait, Cl is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing by induction, but it's ortho/para-directing because it can donate electrons via resonance (but in reality, I think Cl is ortho/para directing but deactivating). Wait, I remember that Cl is an o/p director despite being deactivating. So, for Cl, the incoming electrophile adds ortho or para.

4) -NO2 (nitro): strong deactivating, meta-directing.

5) -C2H5 (ethyl): similar to methyl, since it's an alkyl group. So activating, o/p-directing.

6) -COOH (carboxylic acid): strong deactivating, meta-directing.

So, now for each substituent, the major product(s) would be in specific positions. But the question is about the weight fraction (yield) of the para isomer. So for each compound, we need to find out how much of the para product is formed compared to others.

But wait, the question says that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. No, wait, the question says, "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Hmm, that can't be right because some substituents would lead to multiple products. Unless the substituent is such that only one position is possible. Like for a meta director, but even then, you might have two possible positions if the substituent is in a certain position.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the major product regardless of the number of possible positions. Or maybe each substituent leads to a single major product, or perhaps the mono-bromination occurs in a way that the substituent directs to only one position. But I think that's not possible, except for some cases.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the substituent's effect on the ring's re
