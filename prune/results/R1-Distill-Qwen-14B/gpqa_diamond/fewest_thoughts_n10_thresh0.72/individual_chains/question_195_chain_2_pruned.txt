Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about planets transiting a star and the conditions for occultation events. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The first planet has Earth's radius and is in a circular orbit with an impact parameter of 0.2. The star is 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period is 3 days. And the question is about a second planet, with 2.5 Earth radii, also in a circular, coplanar orbit. We need to find the maximum period this second planet can have while still allowing both transit and occultation events.

Wait, so what's the deal with transit and occultation events? Oh right, a transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet's light (if it emits any, like if it's very bright) is blocked. But for the planet to have an occultation, the star must be larger than the planet. Or wait, maybe it's when the planet is not illuminated by the star? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait no, occultation in the context of exoplanets probably refers to when the planet moves behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked. But you can only detect this if the planet emits its own light, like reflecting starlight or emitting infrared. But regardless, for the planet to be able to transit and occultate, it must pass in front and behind the star. 

But more importantly, for the planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on enough so that the planet's orbit intersects our line of sight. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) from the center of the star when the planet transits. If the impact parameter is zero, it's a central transit. 

So, the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2. That means when it transits, it passes 0.2 times the star's radius away from the center. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii
