Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/parallax^5. Hmm. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r. I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to figure out the relationship between parallax and distance, then see how that affects the number of stars.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth's orbit. Oh right, the formula I think is that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So parallax (plx) equals 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. That makes sense. So if distance increases, parallax decreases.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let me express N in terms of distance. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that into the equation gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's compute that: 1/(1/d)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, that can't be right. Because N would then increase as distance increases, but that doesn't make sense because stars further away should be fewer in number per unit volume, right? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. If plx is inversely proportional to distance, then 1/plx is proportional to distance. So 1/plx^5 would be (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit distance. So is this about the number density or the actual number in a shell?

Wait, the question says "per unit range of distance, r". Hmm. So perhaps they're referring to the number of stars per unit distance. So it's the differential number of stars as you move a small distance dr. So like, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr. Let me think.

If the number of stars N in a shell
