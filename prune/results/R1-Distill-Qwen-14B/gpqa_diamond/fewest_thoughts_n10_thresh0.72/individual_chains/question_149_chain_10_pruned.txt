Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right but has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So each is about half the expected peak. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not something like a neighboring proton causing splitting.

Then the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass as expected. So same molecular weight, same retention time? Or maybe not, but same mass spec. Hmm.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if it's a precursor, the mass would be different. The question says both peaks have same mass as expected, so the molecular weight is same. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, without chiral resolution, they'd look the same. Wait, but in achiral environments, enantiomers may show identical NMR signals. So why two peaks for the same proton? Unless it's a diastereomeric mixture? Or maybe the sample isn't pure and has some other isomer. Hmm, but enantiomers wouldn't split the same proton into two peaks. Because the environment would be same for each group, so they'd overlap, right?

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what this means. Maybe like when forming an amide, sometimes you get some coupling issues, but I'm not sure how that would lead to two peaks for the same proton. Alternatively, perhaps during the reaction, some double bonds formed or something causing different coupling partners. Alternatively, maybe double coupling refers to something else, like if the proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So probably not C.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would be different. For the same alpha proton, in diastereomers, the chemical environment would be different. Wait, but the chemical shifts of
