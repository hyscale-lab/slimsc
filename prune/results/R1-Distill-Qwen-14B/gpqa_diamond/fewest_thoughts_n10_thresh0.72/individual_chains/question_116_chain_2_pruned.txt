Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it step by step. 

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. So a triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three. 

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the integration. 6H and 4H. That adds up to 10 protons. But wait, a cyclohexane ring usually has 6 H's, but maybe it's something else. Oh wait, wait, maybe this is about an isopropyl group or something similar. Because the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H is common for two equivalent CH3 groups. Like, maybe there's two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 would be a triplet if next to a CH2. Let me think: a triplet arises from coupling with two protons. So each CH3 is next to a CH2. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2... Hmm, but wait, the other signal is a quartet for 4H. Quartet would be coupling with three protons on each adjacent carbon. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted something, like maybe a diethyl group? Wait, wait. Let me think: If I have a structure where there are two equivalent CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2, and those CH2 groups are adjacent to another CH2 group. So for example, (CH2CH3)2CHCH2... No, maybe that's not right. Wait, another approach: In the NMR, the triplet (6H) suggests two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2, because each CH3 would be a triplet if next to a CH2. The quartet (4H) suggests a CH2 group next to another CH2 group. Oh wait, maybe it's a 2,2-dimethylbutane or something. Wait, wait, but let's think more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative. Because cyclohexane itself would have equivalent protons, but if there's branching, maybe. Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That could be two CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2. For example, in a structure like CH2CH2(C(CH3)2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to a central carbon. Wait, but let's think of ethyl groups. Each ethyl group has a triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the adjacent CH2. But wait, the NMR here shows two signals, so perhaps the structure is such that there are two CH3 groups and a central CH2 or something like that.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)2CHCH2... No, but that would split the signals differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's two ethyl groups attached to a central carbon. But wait, let me think again. 

So the first signal is triplet, 6H at 0.9. So maybe it's two methyl groups, each attached to a CH2. So for each CH3, the adjacent CH2 would have two protons. So each CH3 is split into a triplet because they are next to a CH2 (which has two H's). So the CH3 groups are each part of a -CH2-CH3 group, but perhaps two of them in the structure. 

The second signal is quartet, 4H at 1.3. A quartet implies each H is next to three H's. So a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group (each CH2 has two H's). So perhaps the structure is something like CH2CH2 connected to something else. Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group attached to a central structure. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a neopentyl group? No, neopentyl has a central CH2 connected to four CH3 groups, but the NMR would show a singlet for the central CH2, I think. 

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl ether or something. But diethyl ether would have triplet for the CH3 and quartet for the CH2. Oh wait, in diethyl ether, the CH3 would be a triplet because they're next to CH2, and the CH2 would be a quartet because they're next to another CH2. So in diethyl ether, the NMR would show a triplet at around 1.2 ppm for the CH3 and a quartet at 3.4 ppm for the OCH2CH3. But in this question, the triplet is at 0.9 and quartet at 1.3. So that's lower ppm, which suggests maybe the structure is more branched and perhaps cyclic. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe the structure is 2,2-dimethylbutane? Let me think: 2,2-dimethylbutane would be (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. The central CH would have two CH3 groups attached. The CH3 groups (the ones on the CH) would be a triplet because they're next to the CH (which has two H's). The CH2 would be a quartet because it's next to the CH (which has two H's). But wait, in that case, the CH2 group would have two H's, but the quartet in the question is 4H, which is two CH2 groups. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative, but that seems unlikely. 

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane with substituents. For example, 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. But in that case, the substituents would be axial or equatorial. Alternatively, maybe it's a norbornane structure or something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's think about the splitting. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So, four hydrogens as quartet. That could be two CH2 groups each adjacent to another CH2. So perhaps a structure with two CH2 groups connected in a chain, each next to a CH2. 

Wait, maybe it's a structure like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to the same carbon. Wait, but the triplet is for 6H, so two CH3 groups. So perhaps the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopentane with substituents. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: think about the reaction steps.

Compound A undergoes monobromination to form B. Then B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. C has two geometrical isomers, meaning it's a di-substituted alkene perhaps, but wait, wait, when a bromoalkane undergoes elimination (with alcoholic KOH), it forms an alkene. So if B is a bromoalkane, then C is an
