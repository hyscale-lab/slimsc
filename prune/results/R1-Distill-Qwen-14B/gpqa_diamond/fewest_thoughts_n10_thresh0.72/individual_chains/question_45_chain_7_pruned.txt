Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of each particle is E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, but the problem gives E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² * E. So each particle's energy is E multiplied by the square of its quantum number.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Since they're spin-1/2, which is fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum numbers are just the n's. But wait, since it's a 1D system, the particles are spin-½, so each state can hold two particles with opposite spins.

So for four fermions, we need to fill up the energy levels according to the Pauli exclusion. Let me think about how the particles fill up the states.

First, the ground state. The lowest energy level is n=1. Since each n can have
