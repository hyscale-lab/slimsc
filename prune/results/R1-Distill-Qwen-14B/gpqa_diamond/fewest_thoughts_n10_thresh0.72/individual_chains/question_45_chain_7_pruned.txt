Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined, and their energy levels are quantized. The problem is asking for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, so they're fermions, right? Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state in the system. So for a one-dimensional infinite potential well, each particle will have a quantum number n, and because of the exclusion principle, each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²) = n² E, where E is the given constant. Oh right, the question defines E as π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy depends on n squared.

Since we have four particles, we need to distribute them into the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion. Each state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin state. But wait, spin is 1/2, so for each n, there are two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can accommodate two particles, each with opposite spins.

So let's think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. For four fermions, we'll need to fill the lowest available n levels with two particles each.

The lowest n is 1. So two particles will have n=1, each in a different spin state. Next, n=2 can hold two more particles. Because each n can have two particles due to spin up and down. So the ground state configuration would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. For four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spin), next two into n=2. So each of these levels is filled. Then, the next available level is n=3. Wait, but no, because with four particles, n=1 and n=2 can each hold two, so that's four total. So the ground state configuration is n=1 (two particles), n=2 (two particles), and n=3 empty.

But wait, wait, no. Because each energy level for a single particle is E_n = n² E. So in terms of energy, the total energy of the system is the sum
