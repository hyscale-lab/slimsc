Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, which is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator, so the energy levels are quantized in a particular way.

The problem is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (eigenstates) that have the same energy eigenvalue as that state.

First, I need to recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I think the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, more accurately, in 3D, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. But since the potential is isotropic, the 3D oscillator can be treated as three independent 1D oscillators along each axis. So the energy is a sum of each of their energies.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, the energy levels might be characterized by a different set of quantum numbers. Hmm, wait, in 3D, the energy levels can also be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number. Let me think. Oh right, for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the total quantum number n, which is given by n = 2l + n_r + 1 or something like that? Or maybe it's n = n_r + l, but I'm a bit confused here. Wait, wait, no, perhaps another approach is better.

Another approach: the energy levels in 3D can be written in terms of the sum of the three quantum numbers. So each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for each axis. So the total energy would be E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2).

But since the system is isotropic, the energy doesn't depend on the direction, only on the sum of the quantum numbers. So for a given n = n_x + n_y + n_z, the energy is E = ħω (n +
