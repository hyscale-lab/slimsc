Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, so it's a pretty rigid structure. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. Heating it with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so probably an elimination reaction is happening here. Since there are two bromides, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr and forming a double bond.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If the bromines are on adjacent carbons (like 1 and 2), elimination would form a double bond. But in this case, 1 and 3 are two positions apart. Hmm, wait, the structure of adamantane is such that the positions are in a way that the 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent carbons in a certain arrangement. Maybe when you eliminate, you form a bridge or a ring with a double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. So, after elimination, the product 1 is a light yellow solid. The NMR data is given: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H), and an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, IR at 1720 is a carbonyl group. But wait, KOH is a base, so maybe it's an epoxide? Or maybe it's a ketone?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH. Oh wait, wait, KOH in such a reaction could lead to an elimination to form an alkene, but perhaps more likely, especially with dibromide, it's a dehydrohalogenation twice. So, from 1,3-dibromo, maybe two E2 eliminations, each removing a Br and an H, leading to a conjugated diene? But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, another thought: KOH could also cause the formation
