Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with vector constructs and protein expression. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully.

Alright, let me start by going through the question step by step. So, the scenario is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher created a bicistronic vector using a lox-Cre system. Let me break down the vector setup.

The vector is bicistronic, meaning it contains two ORFs (open reading frames) under a single promoter. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end and fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. So, the ligand is first, then the receptor.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry, so they can drive the expression of a second ORF in a bicistronic construct. So the CBA promoter drives the first ORF (ligand) and the IRES allows for the second ORF (receptor) to be expressed as well.

Now, looking at the stop cassettes. Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that these loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. The stop cassette would prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise the stop.

Wait, so without Cre, the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry, but the receptor wouldn't be expressed because the stop cassette is in between. Or is it the other way around? No, wait. The ligand's ORF is at the 5', followed by the stop cassette (loxP-stop), then mCherry. So the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry only if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor is at the 3', and the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the stop is present, so the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed together. Hmm, but wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. Oh wait, no, the IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF, which is in the same mRNA as the ligand. So without the stop cassettes being excised, the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor would be expressed as receptor-eGFP only if the stop is removed.

Wait, no. The IRES is for the second ORF. So the first ORF is ligand, then the IRES, then receptor. So the mRNA is ligand followed by IRES followed by receptor. Without any Cre, the stop cassettes are in place. So for the ligand, the stop is between ligand and mCherry. So ligand is expressed as a separate protein, but without the mCherry? Or is mCherry part of the fusion? Wait, the question says the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. Oh, I think that means the ligand is cloned in frame with mCherry. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, but only if the stop is removed. Otherwise, the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor is fused to eGFP; so the receptor would be expressed as receptor-eGFP, but again, only if the stop is removed.

But wait, the vector is set up so that the ligand and receptor are in the same bicistronic mRNA, but the IRES is for the second ORF. So, the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the first ORF (ligand) with the IRES allowing the second ORF (receptor) to be expressed. Without the stop being removed, the ligand expression is ligand-mCherry, but the receptor is not expressed because the stop is present.

Wait, the stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. Cre would excise the stops when present. So when Cre is expressed, the stops are removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed with their respective fluorescent proteins.

In the experiment, the researcher transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins for Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning loading was correct. So presumably, the proteins were expressed.

Then, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. Cre is under SOX10 control, so it's expressed in neural crest derivatives.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under confocal. They expected green signal, which is eGFP. But they don't see it. So the eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. So they act on different cells. But that wouldn't prevent eGFP expression, right? Because the receptor is expressed, regardless of ligand. Unless the paracrine relationship means ligand is secreted and acts elsewhere. But that doesn't explain why eGFP isn't expressed.

B) receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent surface expression, so maybe fluorescence wouldn't be seen. But why wouldn't the Western blot pick it up? Because the Western would detect the protein regardless of its location. Unless it's not being synthesized. Hmm, but the Western blot was done on transfected cells, which are primary astrocytes. The mouse model is used to see expression in live animals. So maybe in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, but in the Western, the proteins are expressed. But the question says that the mouse was homozygous, so perhaps the expression relies on Cre.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So in the mouse, when Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), the stops would be excised, leading to expression of both ligand and receptor. Since they're in neural crest cells, which express SOX10, the Cre would be active, and the stops would be removed.

But the offspring didn't show green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Option C: enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the construct has the CBA promoter for the ligand and IRES for the receptor, so enhancers might not be a factor here. Or perhaps the promoter isn't active in the cells/tissues being examined.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So, the ORF for receptor is not in frame with eGFP. But the question says the receptor is fused to eGFP. So they should be in frame. If they're not, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a fusion, but perhaps as a separate tag. But if the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be properly translated, so no fluorescence.

Wait, but the vector setup—so the vector has the ligand ORF followed by the IRES, then the receptor ORF, then the stop cassette (lox2272) and then eGFP. Oh wait, no. Wait, the vector has the ligand at 5' with a stop, then mCherry. The receptor is at 3' with a stop before eGFP.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the mRNA is ligand ORF followed by IRES, then receptor ORF. So the first ORF is ligand with mCherry fusion, the second is receptor with eGFP. But in the presence of Cre, both stops are excised.

But how's the expression set up? So in the absence of Cre, the ligand stops before mCherry, so no ligand-mCherry. The receptor is followed by a stop before eGFP, so no receptor-eGFP. So only when Cre is present, the stops are removed, allowing both to be expressed.

Wait, perhaps in the mouse, the Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice. So in the offspring, the Cre should excise the loxP and lox2272 stops, allowing expression of both ligand and receptor with their respective tags.

But the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So the construct is present in both alleles. Each allele has the same setup.

However, when they crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, so the stops should be excised, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But the eGFP isn't being visualized. So why?

Maybe the IRES isn't working. Wait, but the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the first ORF is ligand, then IRES, then receptor. In the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of the fluorescent proteins. But in the presence of Cre, the stops are gone, so the ligand would be ligand-mCherry, and receptor would be receptor-eGFP.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic construct. So the Cre would cause the removal of the stops, allowing both proteins to be expressed. But if the construct didn't have the correct sequences, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Looking at option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So the ORF for the receptor is not in frame with eGFP. If that's the case, the eGFP wouldn't be properly expressed as a fusion. But then, in the Western blot, would the antibody against eGFP detect it? Or would the eGFP not be expressed at all?

Alternatively, if the stop cassette wasn't properly removed, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the mouse is homozygous, and the Cre is present. So why isn't the stop excised?

Wait, perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are different. The loxP is used by Cre to excise the stop. But if the vector uses lox2272, which is a variant, maybe the Cre from SOX10-Cre doesn't recognize it? Wait, I think lox2272 is a variant of loxP that is Cre-specific. Wait no, loxP is the original, and lox2272 is a mutant that allows for directional excision. So Cre can recognize both, but maybe the way the cassettes are arranged is causing issues.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes are in the opposite orientation. Or maybe the lox sites are in the wrong orientation.

Wait, the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 between receptor and eGFP. So when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassettes. So the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the Western, the proteins were overexpressed, implying that expression is happening. So in the mouse, why isn't eGFP visible? Because the construct is in the mouse, and Cre is active in the neural crest, which should excise the stops. So the eGFP should be expressed.

But in the confocal, the mouse didn't show a green signal. So maybe the eGFP isn't expressed in the right cells, or isn't expressed at all.

Wait, the vector is homozygous. So each allele has the same construct. But in the absence of Cre, no expression of the fluorescent proteins. But in the presence of Cre (from SOX10), which is expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, the stops are excised, so the ligand and receptor should be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the frame is wrong. So if the receptor is not in frame with eGFP, the eGFP wouldn't be made. So when they look for eGFP, there's nothing.

Wait, but the vector is designed with the receptor at the 3', followed by a stop, then eGFP. So the receptor is cloned into the vector as a fusion with eGFP. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed as a fusion, but perhaps as a separate protein. But then, the Western blot would detect eGFP, but in the mouse, the construct would express eGFP, so they should see it.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not correctly inserted. Maybe the eGFP is in the wrong reading frame, so the receptor and eGFP are not covalently linked. But in that case, the eGFP might still be expressed, just not as a fusion. So the Western would detect eGFP, and the fluorescence would be present.

Wait, but in the mouse, the construct is under the control of the CBA promoter for the ligand, and the IRES for the receptor. So when Cre is present, both should be expressed. But in the confocal, no green. So perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not expressed because the ORF is in the wrong frame. So when the stop is excised, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is not. Because the ORF after the stop is eGFP, but if the frame is wrong, the eGFP isn't translated properly.

Wait, but the construct has the receptor ORF followed by a stop and then eGFP. Oh wait, no. The receptor is at the 3', and between the receptor ORF and eGFP is a stop cassette. So the structure is ligand ORF (with stop before mCherry), IRES, receptor ORF (with stop before eGFP), and then eGFP. Or is it that the receptor is followed by a stop and eGFP?

No, the way the question says: the ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry, and between ligand ORF and mCherry is the loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between the receptor ORF and eGFP is the lox2272-stop-lox2272.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So let me clarify the vector structure:

- 5' -> [CBA promoter] --> [ligand ORF] --> loxP-stop-loxP --> mCherry --> IRES --> [receptor ORF] --> lox2272-stop-lox2272 --> eGFP --> 3'

Wait, no. Because the vector is bicistronic, so the first ORF is ligand, followed by the IRES, then the second ORF is receptor. So the structure is:

5' [CBA] --> [ligand ORF] --> loxP-stop-loxP --> [mCherry] --> IRES --> [receptor ORF] --> lox2272-stop-lox2272 --> [eGFP] 3'

Wait, no, that can't be right because the IRES would be between ligand and receptor. So the correct structure should be:

5' [CBA promoter] --> [ligand ORF] --> [IRES] --> [receptor ORF] --> 3'

But in this case, the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is fused to eGFP. So perhaps the actual structure is:

[CBA promoter] --> [ligand ORF] followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop), then mCherry. Then, downstream is an IRES, followed by the receptor ORF, then a stop cassette (lox2272-stop), then eGFP.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the vector is bicistronic, with two cassettes. The first is ligand ORF with a stop and mCherry, the second is IRES, receptor ORF, stop, eGFP.

So in the absence of Cre, the first ORF (ligand) would be expressed as ligand, but then the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed in frame. Similarly, the second ORF (receptor) would be expressed, but the stop would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

When Cre is present, it would excise both stop cassettes. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry, and the receptor as receptor-eGFP.

Wait, but no, the way the question describes it is:

The ligand ORF is at 5' and fused to mCherry, with a stop in a loxP cassette between them. The receptor ORF is at 3' and fused to eGFP, with a stop in a lox2272 cassette between them.

So the vector is:

Ligand ORF (with stop loxP in between) ---> mCherry

Then, IRES followed by receptor ORF (with stop lox2272 in between) ---> eGFP.

So the bicistronic vector has two ORFs: ligand and receptor, each followed by a stop cassette and then a fluorescent protein.

But in the presence of Cre, the stops are excised, so the ligand would be ligand-mCherry, and the receptor would be receptor-eGFP.

So in the mouse, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, so the stops are excised, and both ligand and receptor should be expressed with their respective tags.

But the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes, not the mouse. So in the astrocytes, perhaps the construct is being expressed, but in the mouse, maybe something else is wrong.

Wait, the question said that in the mouse, they crossed it to SOX10-Cre. So the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, and the Cre is provided by the SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is active in the neural crest, so the Cre should be active there.

But the Western blot, done on transfected astrocytes, shows that the proteins are expressed. So in the mouse, the construct is correctly inserted, and Cre is present.

But why isn't the eGFP expressed in the mouse?

Looking back at the options:

Option D suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF is not correctly in frame, the eGFP won't be expressed as a fusion. But the eGFP might still be expressed as a separate protein, but not as a fusion. However, the Western blot would still detect eGFP. So if the eGFP isn't visible under the confocal, perhaps it's not being expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, the Cre would have excised the stop cassettes, allowing the eGFP to be expressed. So if D is correct, the frame is wrong, so eGFP isn't expressed. Then, the Western blot wouldn't detect eGFP either, but the question says the blot shows signals proportional to actin. Wait, but the blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So the blot would detect the receptor-eGFP if it's expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because the frame is wrong. So the eGFP isn't made, hence no fluorescence. But the Western blot wouldn't show eGFP, but perhaps the ligand is expressed.

Wait, no. The Western blot was done on the transfected primary astrocytes. In the mouse, the construct is present, but when they crossed it with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest, not in astrocytes. So in the primary astrocytes, which don't express Cre, the stops would still be present, so mCherry and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the question says that the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, meaning that the proteins are being expressed. So perhaps in the astrocytes, the ligand's ORF is expressed, but the receptor's is not. Or vice versa.

Wait, no, because without Cre, the stops are present, so ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Unless the ORFs are being expressed as separate proteins.

Wait, perhaps the construct is designed to express the ligand and receptor as separate proteins. But the way it's described, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor fused to eGFP.

So, without Cre, the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, preventing mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop, preventing eGFP from being expressed.

When Cre is present, the stops are gone, so ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP are expressed.

In the Western blot on astrocytes (without Cre), the proteins shouldn't be expressed. But the question says the blot shows signals proportional to actin. So maybe the ligand and receptor are being expressed as separate proteins, even without the fluorescent tags.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', followed by stop, then mCherry. Without Cre, the ligand ORF is expressed as a separate protein, without mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, without eGFP. So the Western blot would detect the ligand and receptor proteins, but not the fluorescent tags.

But the question says that the researcher raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the antibodies are against the ligand and receptor, not the fluorescent proteins. So the Western blot would show the presence of the ligand and receptor proteins, regardless of the stop cassettes. The fluorescent tags are not part of the proteins being detected on the blot.

So that explains why the Western blot is positive—because the ligand and receptor are expressed as separate proteins.

Then, in the mouse, the construct is homozygous, meaning both alleles have the same construct. When crossed to SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, which would excise the stops, allowing ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

But the confocal didn't show a green signal. So the eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Possible reasons:

1. The IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But the CBA promoter is strong, and the IRES should drive the second ORF.

2. The lox sites are in the wrong orientation, so Cre can't excise the stops. For example, if the loxP sites are in the same orientation, Cre won't excise the cassettes. But loxP is a symmetric site, so orientation shouldn't matter. Wait, no, Cre recombinase requires specific orientation to excise. If the lox sites are in the same orientation, they can't be excised. So if the vector has loxP in a certain orientation, and Cre can't flip them, the stops won't be removed.

But the question says loxP and lox2272. I think lox2272 is a variant, but I'm not sure about the orientation.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 cassette isn't being excised because the Cre isn't compatible. Wait, lox2272 is a mutant version of loxP that allows for directional excision but is still recognized by Cre. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Another possibility is that the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because of a frame shift.

So, looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is excised, the receptor ORF is not in frame with eGFP, so eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, the eGFP wouldn't be present, so the confocal wouldn't show green.

But the Western blot would detect the receptor if the stop is excised. Because without the stop, the receptor would be expressed as a separate protein, which the antibody would detect. But then the blot would show the receptor. Wait, but in the mouse, the construct is under the influence of Cre, so the stops are excised. Thus, the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, and the eGFP isn't expressed because the frame is wrong.

But the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes, where Cre isn't present, so the stops are present. So in the mouse, the stops are excised, but eGFP isn't expressed because of frame issues.

So if D is correct, in the mouse, the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, but eGFP isn't expressed because it's not in frame. So no green signal in confocal.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D.


The question involves a bicistronic vector expressing a ligand and receptor, each fused to fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP, respectively), with stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) flanking the fluorescent tags. The vector is designed to express the ligand and receptor only when Cre recombinase is present, which excises the stop cassettes. The mouse model is homozygous for this construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, where Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy in the offspring.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship describes ligand-receptor interactions between different cells. However, this does not explain why eGFP is not expressed. The question focuses on expression in the same cells (neural crest derivatives), so this option is irrelevant.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be synthesized and detectable via Western blot. The absence of a green signal in the confocal microscopy could be due to improper localization, but the Western blot shows protein expression, making this explanation unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand and an IRES for the receptor, which should drive expression in the absence of enhancers. This option does not align with the experimental setup, as the promoter and IRES are functional.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor ORF is not in frame with eGFP, the eGFP fusion protein would not be expressed. This would result in the absence of a green signal in the confocal microscopy. The Western blot detects the receptor protein, confirming its expression, but the absence of eGFP fluorescence aligns with this explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing the expression of the eGFP fusion protein. This accounts for the absence of a green signal in the confocal microscopy while still allowing the receptor to be detected via Western blot. 

Answer: D
