Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Hmm, right, divergence theorem comes into play here, I think.

The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and it only has a radial component. So f(r) is pointing radially outward or inward, but since it's 1/r², maybe it's similar to an electric field? Like Coulomb's law.

Wait, the problem says to evaluate the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of a sphere. Mathematically, that's ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV. I remember that the divergence theorem relates this volume integral to the surface integral of f over the boundary of the volume. So ∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ f · n dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

But wait, in this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R, so the surface is at r=R. The vector field f at the surface would be f(r) evaluated at r=R. Since the magnitude is 1/r², at r=R, it's 1/R².

But wait, the divergence theorem is applicable here. So I can either compute the volume integral directly or the surface integral. Maybe computing the surface integral is easier because the field is radial.

Wait, let me think: f has only radial component. So in spherical coordinates, f(r) = (1/r²) er, where er is the unit radial vector. So the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only radial component is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) ). 

So f_r is 1/r². So the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Because if f is 1/r² radial, then its divergence is zero except perhaps at the origin.

Wait, but wait, if f is (1/r²) er, then the divergence is ∇ · f. Let me compute it correctly.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field A = A_r er + A_θ eθ + A_φ eφ is:

(1/r²) [d(r² A_r)/dr] + (1/(r sin
