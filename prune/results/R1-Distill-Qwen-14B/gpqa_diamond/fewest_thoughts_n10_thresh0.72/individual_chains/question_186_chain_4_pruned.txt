Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these rearrangement reactions. The question is about the Cope rearrangement of a specific compound, and I need to figure out which product it forms from the given options.

Let me start by recalling what the Cope rearrangement is. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. It forms a new six-membered ring. The reaction is usually thermally induced, right? So the molecule must have a conjugated diene system that's set up in a way that allows for this kind of rearrangement.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, okay, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like a norbornane structure. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, which are both bridgeheads in the norbornane system.

So, the molecule has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to the second carbon (2-vinyl). The "2-azabicyclo..." part means that there's a nitrogen atom in the bridge. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the numbering here. Let me think: in bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, the bridgeheads are 1, 4, and another position. Wait, no, the numbering is such that the two bridgeheads are 1 and 5, perhaps? Or maybe I should draw this out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as a bicyclic system where the bridges are two carbons, two carbons, and one carbon. The 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have a double bond at position 5. So, the bicyclo system is a norbornene, with a double bond in one of the rings, and a nitrogen in another position.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch this mentally. The bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would look like a norbornene where the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 (if I number the bridgehead as 1). So carbon 1 is connected to two bridges—one of two carbons and another of two and one. Wait, maybe not. Let me correct that.

The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure has bridgehead carbons 1 and 4. The bridges are of lengths 2, 2
