Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my classes. So the question is about an atomic nucleus that hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The initial probability given is 32% within 100 minutes.

Wait, radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and the key here is that the decay process is memoryless. Oh wait, that's the exponential decay model, right? So the decay probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. 

The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability that the atom decays in the first 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait. Oh, noâ€”wait, the next 150 minutes after the 50 that have already passed. So the total time from now would be 150 minutes, not 100. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

Wait, the question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the probability P(t) = 0.32 at t=100. But since it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what's the
