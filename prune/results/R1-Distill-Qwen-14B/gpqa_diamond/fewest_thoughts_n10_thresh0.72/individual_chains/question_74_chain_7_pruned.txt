Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay probability, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about an atom that hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, and we want to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, which is memoryless. Oh right, the decay process is a Poisson process, so the probability only depends on the time that has passed, not on when you started observing.

Wait, the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So earlier, some experiments showed that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32% or 0.32. I think that relates to the decay constant.

I recall that the decay probability (the survival probability) is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Wait, actually, the decay probability is the chance that the atom has decayed by time t. So the probability that it has decayed by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

In the experiment, they found that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me solve for λ.

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - (ln(0.68)) / 100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately... well, ln(1)=0, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Wait, ln(0.68) is a bit lower. Maybe around -0.3857? Let me check: e^(-0.385) is about 0.68? Let me compute 0.68: Let's see, e^(-0.4) is about 0.670
