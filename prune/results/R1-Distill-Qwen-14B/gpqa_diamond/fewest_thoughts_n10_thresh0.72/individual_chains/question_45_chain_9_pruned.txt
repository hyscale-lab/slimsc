Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking me to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about particles in a 1D infinite potential well. Each particle has energy levels given by the formula E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the quantum number (a positive integer), m is the mass of the particle, L is the length of the well, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. The problem gives E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So each quantum state can hold only one particle, and each state is defined by the quantum numbers and spin. But since they are in a 1D well, the main quantum number is n, and spin comes into play as an additional state.

Wait, in a 1D infinite well, each particle's state is determined by its quantum number n and its spin. Since spin-1/2 has two possible states (up and down), each n can hold two particles—one with spin up and one with spin down.

So when we have four identical particles (all fermions), we need to fill up the lowest energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion principle.

Let's think about how to arrange four particles. Since each n can hold two particles, we can fill n=1 with two particles (spin up and down), n=2 with two particles, but wait, that's four particles. But that would mean all four particles are in n=1 and n=2 levels. But wait, wait, in a 1D well, the energy depends only on n, so each particle's energy is determined by n.

Wait, no. Because the particles are identical fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But in a 1D box, the spatial wavefunction symmetry depends on the permutation of the particles. Wait, but in this case, since all the particles are in the same spatial state (same n), but different spins, the spatial part is symmetric (because all have the same spatial state) and the spin part is antisymmetric (since they are paired), leading to an overall antisymmetric wavefunction, which is okay for fermions.

Wait, maybe I should think more carefully. For four fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. Since the well is 1D, the quantum numbers are just n, and spin. So each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, we'd fill n=1 (two particles) and n=2 (two particles). So their energies would be E_1, E_1, E_2, E_2.

But wait, no. Because when you have multiple particles in the same state, their energies are the same. So each particle in n=1 has energy E_1, each in n=2 has E_2. So the total energy of the system would be the sum of each particle's energy. Since two are in n=1 and two in n=2, the total energy is 2E_1 + 2E_2.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the system in terms of E. Since E is E_1, each E_n is n² E. So E_1 is 1² E = E. E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, etc.

So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2. The total energy would be 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but the question is about the energy of each state (ground, first excited, second excited). Wait, no. Oh wait, no, the question is about the energy levels of the system, not the total energy. Wait, no, the question says "the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system." Hmm, perhaps I misread the question. So the ground state is the lowest possible energy configuration, first excited is the next, etc.

Wait, no, maybe the question is asking for the energy of each state (like the ground state energy, then the first excited, etc.), not the total energy. So I need to find what the energies of these states are.

Wait, the question says: "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

Wait, the system's
