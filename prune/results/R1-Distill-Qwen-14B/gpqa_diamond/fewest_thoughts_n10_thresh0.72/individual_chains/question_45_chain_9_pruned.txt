Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I can check against them once I figure it out.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each has spin up or down. But in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n, right? Spin doesn't directly affect the energy here because the potential doesn't depend on spin. But wait, in a system with identical fermions, like electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle applies. Oh right! They must obey the Pauli exclusion, so each state can have only one fermion with a specific set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which they've given as E multiplied by n². Because E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each n² corresponds to a multiple of E.

So for four particles, each must occupy a different state according to their quantum numbers. But wait, since they are spin-1/2, each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So maybe each spatial level can have two particles.

So, the possible quantum numbers n are 1, 2, 3, etc. Each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, we can fill up the lowest two levels, perhaps.

Wait, let me think step by step.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energies, so we fill the lowest available n with their spin states.

Ground state: Let's see. Each particle is spin-1/2, so each spatial orbital can hold two particles.

So for four particles:

n=1: can have 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can have 2 particles (same spin up and down)
Wait, that would make four particles total. So the ground state would have all four particles in the first two energy levels, each n=1 and n=2, each holding two particles.

Wait, but wait. No, because n=1 can hold two particles, n=2 can hold two, so ground state is all four in n=1 and n=2. So the energies would be 1²E + 2²E, but wait, no. Wait, no, each particle has its own energy. So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, no, the question is to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. So the system's total energy.

So ground state: the four particles are in the lowest possible energies, with the lowest possible total energy.

In a 1D well, each spatial state is E_n = n²E. So for four particles, considering spin, each n can have two particles.

So the ground state configuration would be:

n=1: two particles (each with spin up and down)
n=2: two particles (each with spin up and down)
So the total energy is 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Each particle is in a state with a specific n, and each state can hold two particles. So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (spin
