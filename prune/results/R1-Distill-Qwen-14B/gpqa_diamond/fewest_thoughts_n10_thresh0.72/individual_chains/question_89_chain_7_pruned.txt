Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow and think through each part.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let's break down each reaction and see what's happening.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Looking at the NMR and IR data, I can probably figure out what product 1 is.

The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group (C=O). The ¹H NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That region is usually around where aldehyde protons show up, but wait, aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether or alcohol, but the IR supports carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone or an ester.

Wait, another possibility: if it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction, maybe an elimination occurred. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons (since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, but 1,3 positions are across the ring, I think. So perhaps it's a dihalide that when treated with KOH, which is a strong base, undergoes elimination to form a double bond. But if that's the case, where would the carbonyl come from? Wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement?

Alternatively, think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base, and heating would likely lead to elimination. But let's think about the product. When 1,3-dihalides are treated with a strong base, sometimes they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But in adamantane's case, the structure is pretty rigid.

Wait, perhaps it's an E2 elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, forming an alkene. But then, how
