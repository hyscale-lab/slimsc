Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations involving multiple acids and bases. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking for the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, I remember that mixing acids and bases can be a bit tricky because they can neutralize each other. 

First, I should probably figure out how many moles of each acid and base are present in their respective solutions. Because when you mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the bases. But wait, since there are three solutions, I need to calculate each one's contribution.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH: 
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but I'll note that for later.

Next, HCl: it's a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. So that's 0.08 moles of H+ from HCl.

Then, Ba(OH)2: this is a strong base. Barium hydroxide dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each formula unit gives two OH^- ions. The molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since each mole gives two OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when these solutions are mixed, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L. But before that, I need to find out if the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. So it won't completely donate H+ ions. But when mixed with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, I think the strong base will react first with the strong acid (HCl) before reacting with the weak acid. Alternatively, maybe all the H+ and OH- will just combine regardless of source.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Let me think: HCl provides H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 provides OH- ions. So the reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O.

But also, CH3COOH is an acid, but since it's weak, it's in equilibrium. However, when mixed with a base, the base (OH-) will react with the H+ ions from the strong acid HCl, and any excess OH- will also react with the weak acid.

Wait, no, maybe the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and any remaining OH- would then react with the weak acid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the net moles of H+ and OH-.

Let me sum up the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a
