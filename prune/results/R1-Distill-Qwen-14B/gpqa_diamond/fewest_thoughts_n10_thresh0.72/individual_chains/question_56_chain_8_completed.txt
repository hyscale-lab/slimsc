Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct transition route and the probability. Let me think.

The state is |3,0,0⟩, which I know is an n=3, l=0, m=0 state. It's decaying to |1,0,0⟩, so n goes from 3 to 1. The question says it's via two dipole transitions. So, it must go through an intermediate state.

Dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for hydrogen are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, Δn can be any integer, but in reality, the transitions are usually from higher to lower energy levels, so n decreases here.

Wait, the initial state is l=0, so the first transition must go to l=1 because that's the only allowed change from l=0 (since Δl=±1). So the first transition is from (3,0,0) to (n',1, m'). What's m'?

The m selection rule allows m to change by -1, 0, or +1. So from m=0, possible m's are -1, 0, +1. So the first transition could be to any of these states in l=1.

But wait, the final state is (1,0,0). So from the intermediate state, the second dipole transition must go to (1,0,0). Let me think about the possible intermediate states.

The intermediate state after the first transition must be (2,1, m) because n can't jump from 3 to 1 in one dipole transition. Oh wait, no, dipole transitions can change n by any Δn, but in reality, the transition would be either 3→2→1 or 3→1 directly. Wait, but the question says it's via two dipole transitions, so it's 3→... →1, two steps.

So the first transition is 3→2, but wait, 3 can go to 2 or 1 in the first step. Wait, no, actually, I think in dipole transitions, the n can change by any number as long as l changes by ±1. But wait, no, for hydrogen, the selection rules are Δl=±1, Δm=0,±1. So for the first transition, from l=0 to l=1.

So the first transition would take |3,0,0⟩ to |n', 1, m'⟩, where n' can be 2 or 4 (but higher n is less likely as the atom is going to lower energy states, so probably n decreases). So n' is 2, because 3→2 is a possible step in energy.

So the first transition is from (3,0,0) to (2,1, m'), where m' is 0, ±1. Then, the second transition must go from (2,1,m') to (1,0,0). Let's check the selection rules for the second transition.

In the second transition, the state is (2,1,m'), and it goes to (1,0,0). So Δl = -1, which is allowed. For m, from m' to 0.

So the change in m is (0 - m') which must be Δm = 0, ±1. So m' can be 0, ±1.

Wait, from m' to 0, the allowed Δm is 0, ±1. So:

If m' = 0, then Δm = 0 → allowed.
If m' = +1, Δm = -1 → allowed.
If m' = -1, Δm = +1 → allowed.

So any of these m' values are possible. So the intermediate state could have any of m'=0, +1, -1.

But let's think about the possible transition paths.

First, the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can transition to states with l=1 (so n can be 2 or 4, but more likely 2 since it's lower energy). So possible first steps: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, each of these can transition to the final state |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but from |2,1, m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, let's check the selection rules.

Wait, the second transition: n goes from 2 to 1 (Δn=-1), l goes from 1 to 0 (Δl=-1, which is allowed), and m goes from m' to 0. So the Δm is -m'.

So for each of the possible m' values:

Case 1: m'=0.

 Transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Δm = 0-0=0 → allowed.

So this is a valid path.

Case 2: m'=+1.

Transition from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Δm = 0-1= -1 → allowed.

Case 3: m'=-1.

Transition from |2,1,-1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Δm=0-(-1)=+1→ allowed.

So all three possible intermediate states are allowed. Now, what about the probabilities? The options given have specific probabilities, so I need to figure out which path(s) are possible and what their probabilities are.

Wait, the question says it's via two dipole transitions. So the decay would have to go through two steps: 3→2→1.

But the options present different routes and probabilities. So which of these paths is correct?

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and probability 1/3.

Option B: → |2,1,1⟩ → and 1/4.

Option C: → |2,1,-1⟩ → and 1/4.

Option D: I think the option D is written incorrectly, maybe it's |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and probability 2/3.

Wait, the question is about the transition probability. So I need to calculate the probabilities of each possible path.

But how?

In hydrogen, the transition probability depends on the square of the dipole matrix element. The matrix element for a transition from state |n1, l1, m1⟩ to |n2, l2, m2⟩ is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or the spherical harmonics overlap.

The matrix element for dipole transition is proportional to ∫ Y_{l1 m1}^* r Y_{l2 m2} Y_{1 μ} dr, where μ is the dipole component (like x, y, z; corresponds to m=0, ±1).

Alternatively, the selection rules are applied, and the probability is determined by the allowed transitions.

Wait, but perhaps more straightforward: for each possible intermediate state, what is the probability of each step, and the overall probability would be the product.

So first, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩.

The possible first transitions are to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,-1⟩.

The transition probability for each of these can be determined by the square of the matrix element.

Wait, for the dipole transition, the transition from l=0 to l=1 is only possible because dipole operator has l=1.

The dipole operator components are proportional to Y_{1,±1} and Y_{1,0}.

So the matrix element for transition |n1, 0, 0⟩ → |n2, 1, m2⟩ would be non-zero only if m2 is 0, ±1.

So for each possible m2, the transition is allowed.

But what is the probability for each m2?

The probability depends on the square of the matrix element. For the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the matrix element is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient or something similar.

I recall that when adding angular momenta, the transition probability for a dipole transition from l=0 to l=1 depends on the m values.

Wait, I think the transition probabilities for m=0, +1, -1 are all possible, but their relative probabilities might differ.

Hmm, I think the transition probabilities for m=0, ±1 are each equal. Because the dipole operator can have components Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,-1}, each contributing to their respective m transitions.

Wait, but when the initial state has m=0, the transition to m' is determined by the projection of the dipole operator. So the selection rule allows m' = m + μ, where μ is -1, 0, +1. So from m=0, m' can be -1, 0, +1.

But how probable is each of those transitions?

The probability for each transition is proportional to the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for the transition.

Wait, the initial state is l=0, so spherical harmonic Y_0^0. The dipole operator has components Y_1^m where m=-1,0,+1.

The matrix element for the transition is ∫ Y_0^0 * Y_1^m Y_1^μ dΩ, where μ is the component of the dipole operator (like x, y, z). Wait, actually, the dipole operator is proportional to r Y_1^m, where m is -1,0, +1, corresponding to the x, y, z components.

Wait, the matrix element for the transition from |n1, 0, 0⟩ to |n2,1, m2⟩ is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 * Y_1^m2 * Y_1^μ, but I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

Wait, when the initial state has m=0, the possible transitions are to m'=0, +1, -1.

But considering the possible combinations, the transition probabilities for these m' values might not all be the same.

I think the matrix element for m'=0 is different than for m'=±1.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for m=0 to m'=0 is non-zero, but the others are zero? No, that can't be right because dipole transitions allow m changes of ±1.

Wait, I think the dipole operator has components that can change m by -1, 0, +1. So the transitions are allowed.

But how much probability each m' transition has.

I remember that when you have a spherical harmonic Y_l^m, the product with Y_1^mu can give Y_{l±1}^{m+mu}.

Wait, when you perform the integral ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^mu Y_{l'}^{m'} dΩ, it's non-zero only when m' = 0 + mu, and l' = 1 (since 0 +1=1).

Wait, in this case, l' is 1 because we're going from l=0 to l=1.

Wait, but the initial state is l=0, m=0. The dipole operator has components Y_1^{-1}, Y_1^0, Y_1^+1.

So the possible transitions are:

For each dipole component (mu = -1, 0, +1), the m' would be 0 + mu.

So for mu = -1: m' = -1.

mu=0: m'=0.

mu=+1: m'=+1.

So each dipole component contributes a transition to a different m'.

Now, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 * Y_1^{mu} * Y_1^{m'}.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^mu Y_1^{m'}, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for each m' are the same, so each has a 1/3 chance.

Wait, but I think that's not correct because the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients vary. Let me think: for the transition l=0 → l=1 with m=0 → m'=0, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient would be different than m'=±1.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1.

Wait, the initial state is |0,0⟩. The dipole operator is proportional to |1, m⟩, and the transition is to |1, m'⟩.

Hmm, perhaps the matrix element for each m' is determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining |0,0⟩ and |1, mu⟩ to get |1, m'⟩.

Wait, but I'm not very confident. Maybe I should look up the selection rules for dipole transitions.

Wait, from what I remember, the dipole transition matrix element for a state |n, l, m⟩ to |n', l', m'⟩ is proportional to the integral of Y_l^m * Y_1^{mu} * Y_{l'}^{m'}.

But in this case, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and we're considering transitions to |2,1,m⟩.

So the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^{mu} Y_1^m.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible m transitions and their probabilities.

Another approach: the possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩ are to |2,1, m⟩, m=0, ±1.

The probability for each transition would depend on the square of the matrix element for that specific m.

I think the matrix elements for m=0, +1, -1 are all non-zero, but what's their relative magnitude?

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining |0,0⟩ and |1, mu⟩ to get |1, m'⟩ is non-zero only when m' = mu, because |0,0> * |1, mu> = |1, mu>.

Wait, so if the initial state is |0,0⟩, the transition via dipole operator (which has |1, mu⟩ components) would result in |1, mu⟩ states.

So the possible m's after first transition are mu = -1, 0, +1.

So the transition probabilities for each m' (since the dipole operator has three components) would be same? Or different?

Wait, the dipole operator has three possible components, each contributing equally to the transition probabilities.

Wait, perhaps each dipole component (x, y, z) is equally likely, leading to equal probabilities for m'= -1, 0, +1.

But no, that's not quite right because the spherical harmonics for Y_1^m have different normalization.

Wait, the spherical harmonics Y_1^m have different values. Y_1^0 is sqrt(3/(4π)), Y_1^1 is -sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{iθ}, and Y_1^{-1} is sqrt(3/(8π)) e^{-iθ}.

Wait, but when calculating the matrix element, the integral is over Y_0^0 Y_1^m Y_1^mu, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities for each m' are the same, so each has 1/3 chance.

But wait, I think that's not correct. Because for each mu, the transition probability depends on the square of the integral, which might not be the same for all mu.

Wait, let's compute the matrix elements for each possible m.

The matrix element for the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩ is proportional to the integral ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m Y_1^{mu} dΩ.

Wait, no, perhaps the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^{mu} Y_1^{m}.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the selection rules and the possible m transitions.

Wait, in the dipole approximation, the transition amplitude is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 * Y_1^mu * Y_1^m.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m Y_1^{mu} dΩ.

But Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π), so factoring that in, it's 1/sqrt(4π) times the integral of Y_1^m Y_1^{mu}.

The integral of Y_a Y_b is zero unless a and b are the same angular momentum and m.

Wait, ∫ Y_1^m Y_1^{mu} dΩ is zero unless m = mu, because Y_1^m and Y_1^{mu} are orthogonal for different m and mu.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The integral of Y_{l}^m Y_{l'}^{m'} is zero unless l=l' and m=m'.

But in this case, we're integrating Y_1^m times Y_1^{mu}, which would be non-zero only if m = mu.

Wait, but that would imply that the integral is non-zero only when m=mu, meaning that the dipole component (mu) must match the m of the transition.

Wait, but that can't be right because the dipole operator has mu = -1, 0, +1, and the transition is to m = -1, 0, +1.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is non-zero only when m = mu.

In that case, the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, mu⟩ would be allowed with mu = -1, 0, +1. And the matrix element for each would be proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^{mu} Y_1^{mu} dΩ, since mu is the same for the dipole component and the transition m.

Wait, that would mean that the matrix element is non-zero only when m = mu, but that would imply that each transition m=mu has a non-zero element. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is non-zero only when m = mu. So the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ would involve the mu=0 component of the dipole operator. Similarly, |2,1,1⟩ would involve mu=+1, and |2,1,-1⟩ would involve mu=-1.

If that's the case, then each transition's matrix element would be proportional to the integral of Y_1^{mu} Y_1^{mu}.

Hmm, but Y_1^m are real for m=0 (Y_1^0 is real), but for m=±1, they are imaginary.

Wait, the integral ∫ Y_1^m Y_1^{mu} dΩ is zero unless m = mu.

Wait, that's the orthogonality of spherical harmonics. So for the dipole transition, the matrix element is non-zero only when m = mu.

So for the transition to |2,1,0⟩, mu must be 0. The transition to |2,1,1⟩ requires mu=1, and to |2,1,-1⟩ requires mu=-1.

So each transition is via a different component of the dipole operator.

But what is the magnitude of each transition? The matrix element depends on the value of Y_1^m at that mu.

Wait, the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^mu Y_1^m is non-zero only when m = mu, as discussed.

So the matrix element for each transition is proportional to the integral of Y_1^mu squared, which would be the same for each mu? Or different?

Wait, the integral of |Y_1^mu|^2 is the same for all mu because of the symmetry. Because Y_1^m has the same magnitude for m=0, ±1.

So the square of the matrix element would be the same for each m, implying that the transition probabilities are the same for each m'.

So each m' has a 1/3 chance of being selected.

Wait, but wait, for m=0, the Y_1^0 is sqrt(3/(4π)), and for m=±1, Y_1^m is sqrt(3/(8π)) times something.

Wait, the integral for each transition would be:

Matrix element M = ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^mu Y_1^mu dΩ.

Wait, Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π), so M = (1/sqrt(4π)) ∫ Y_1^mu Y_1^mu dΩ.

The integral ∫ |Y_1^mu|^2 dΩ is 1, because it's the normalization condition. So M = 1/sqrt(4π) * 1.

Wait, but that can't be right because it would imply that all transitions have the same matrix element, hence same probability.

So the probability for each transition (m=0, +1, -1) would be the same, each having 1/3 probability.

Wait, but wait, another possibility is that each dipole component (mu) contributes differently.

Wait, but in reality, the dipole operator has three components, x, y, z, which correspond to Y_1^1, Y_1^{-1}, Y_1^0. Each component contributes to the transition to m' = mu.

So the total transition probability is the sum of the probabilities from each dipole component.

If each component has the same probability, then the total would be three times the probability of one component.

But in our case, each transition (m'=0, +1, -1) is from a different dipole component, and each has the same matrix element magnitude. So the probability for each m' is the same.

So the first transition has three possible paths, each with equal probability. So each would have a 1/3 chance.

Wait, but the initial state |3,0,0⟩ transitions to three possible states with equal probability, 1/3 each.

Then, the second transition must go from each of these to |1,0,0⟩.

So for each intermediate state, what's the probability of transitioning to |1,0,0⟩?

Again, considering the same logic. For each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ must follow the dipole selection rules.

From |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩: Δl = -1, Δm = -m.

So the dipole operator must have m = -m.

Wait, the dipole operator has components Y_1^mu with mu = -1, 0, +1.

So for the transition from m to 0, mu must be -m.

Wait, for example:

If m=0: then mu must be 0.

If m=+1: mu must be -1.

If m=-1: mu must be +1.

So each transition from the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is possible via a specific dipole component.

The probability for each of these transitions is again determined by the square of the matrix element, which as before, would have the same magnitude for each m.

So each transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ has the same probability, 1/3.

But wait, no. Because, when m is different, the matrix element might change.

Wait, again, the matrix element would be proportional to ∫ Y_1^m Y_1^mu Y_0^0 dΩ, but since Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π), the integral becomes ∫ Y_1^m Y_1^mu dΩ.

Which, as before, is non-zero only if mu = -m, because the transition must change m by -m to reach 0.

Wait, no, because the transition m' = m + mu', but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix element for each of these transitions is the same, so each has a 1/3 chance.

So for each intermediate state, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ has a 1/3 probability.

Wait, but that would complicate the overall probability for the entire decay path.

Let me think: the first step has three possible paths, each with 1/3 probability. For each of these, the second step has a 1/3 probability to reach the final state.

So the total probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But wait, that would make each path have a 1/9 probability, but there are three such paths.

So the total probability for all possible paths (3 paths) would sum to 3*(1/9)=1/3.

But wait, the options don't have 1/3 as the probability for all paths; each option gives a specific probability for one particular path.

Wait, but the options are about specific routes, like option A is 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0 with probability 1/3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternative approach: for each transition between steps, the probability is the product of the two steps.

But perhaps we can model each step's probability as 1/3 and 1/3, so the overall probability is (1/3)*(1/3) = 1/9 per path.

But the question is about the transition via two dipole transitions, so all possible paths contribute, and the total probability is the sum of each path's probability.

But the options give specific probabilities, so perhaps each of the three paths (m=0, ±1) contributes equally, so each path has 1/3 of the total probability.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the possible m transitions.

Wait, another angle: when the atom decays, the first transition could be to any of the three m states. Then, from each of these, only one possible path leads to the final state (since the m must go to 0).

Wait, but no: from each intermediate state, there's only one possible m for the final state (m=0), so from each intermediate state, the second transition's probability is 1/3, assuming that the second transition has three possible m' transitions but only one is allowed.

Wait, no, in the second transition, the dipole operator must change m by -m.

So for |2,1, m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole operator must have mu = -m.

Each of these has a certain probability. But perhaps each of these has a 1/3 chance.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the probability of the overall process is the product of the two probabilities.

Wait, but perhaps the overall transition probability is the sum over all possible intermediate states of the product of the probabilities of each step.

So the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can go to |2,1,0⟩ with probability p1, |2,1,1⟩ with p2, and |2,1,-1⟩ with p3.

Then, each of these can transition to |1,0,0⟩ with probabilities q0, q1, q-1, respectively.

So the total probability is p1*q0 + p2*q1 + p3*q-1.

Assuming that each p is 1/3, because the initial transition has three possible m's, each with equal probability.

Then, for each of these, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ is possible only if the dipole operator can change m by mu = -m.

So from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩: mu must be 0.

The probability for this transition is 1/3, as before.

Similarly, from |2,1,1⟩ to |1,0,0⟩: mu must be -1. The transition probability is 1/3.

Same for |2,1,-1⟩: mu must be +1, probability 1/3.

So the total probability is (1/3 * 1/3) *3 = 3*(1/9)=1/3.

Wait, but that's the sum of all possible paths.

But the question is about the probability for a specific path, not the total.

Wait, the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability are".

So each option gives a specific route, like 3→2,1,0→1,0,0, and a probability.

If each of the three possible paths has a 1/3 chance of being taken, but each path has a probability of 1/3, then the sum is 1.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all possible decay paths must be 1, but the question is about a specific path.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can only decay via certain routes. For example, perhaps the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is more probable.

Wait, another thought: the transition from n=3 to n=2 and l=1 might have different probabilities depending on the specific m.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the dipole transition probabilities are not the same for each m.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities depend on the square of the matrix element, which in turn depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 and l=1 to get l'=1.

The coefficient for m=0 would be different than for m=±1.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |0,0⟩ and |1, mu⟩ to get |1, m⟩ is non-zero only when m=mu.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that. Maybe I should look up the CG coefficients.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining |l1, m1⟩ and |l2, m2⟩ to |L, M⟩ are non-zero only when M = m1 + m2, and L ≥ |l1 - l2| and L ≤ l1 + l2.

In the initial transition, we're combining |0,0⟩ (l1=0) with |1, mu⟩ (l2=1, m2=mu) to get |1, mu⟩ (since M = 0 + mu).

So the CG coefficients are 1 for each case because when l1=0, the CG coefficients are 1.

Wait, that can't be right. No, CG coefficients depend on the specific combination.

Wait, for example, when combining |0,0⟩ and |1,0⟩, the result is |1,0⟩ with coefficient 1.

Similarly, for |0,0⟩ and |1,1⟩, the result is |1,1⟩ with coefficient 1.

Same for |1,-1⟩.

So the transition amplitude from |0,0⟩ to |1, mu⟩ is proportional to the CG coefficient, which is 1 in each case.

So each transition has the same amplitude, leading to same probability.

So each transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩ has the same probability of 1/3.

Then, each of these transitions to |1,0,0⟩ has a 1/3 chance, as before.

So the total probability for each specific path (like 3→2,1,0→1,0,0) would be (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But the question is about the transition via two steps, so the total probability would be the sum of all possible paths.

Wait, but each of the three paths contributes 1/9, so total is 3*(1/9)=1/3.

But the options don't have this; each option gives a specific probability for a specific path.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability for each possible path and sum them.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0 with probability 1/3.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 →1,0,0 with 1/4.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0 with 1/4.

Option D: 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0 with 2/3.

Wait, option D's probability is 2/3, which seems high.

But earlier, I thought each path's probability is 1/9, but that's only if each step is 1/3. But perhaps the first transition isn't equally probable for each m.

Maybe the transition probabilities for the first step are not equal.

Wait, let's think about the matrix elements again.

The matrix element for the first transition (3→2) is proportional to ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^m Y_1^{mu} dΩ.

Wait, but Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π), and Y_1^m and Y_1^{mu} are the spherical harmonics.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is zero unless m = -mu.

Wait, because the dipole operator has m=mu, and the transition is m = initial m + mu.

Wait, initial m is 0, so m' = mu.

Wait, but the dipole operator has mu = -1,0,+1.

So m' = mu.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{mu} dΩ, but mu must equal m' because m' = mu.

Wait, so the integral becomes ∫ Y_0^0 Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m'} dΩ.

Which is:

(1/sqrt(4π)) * ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m'} dΩ.

Because Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π).

And the integral ∫ Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m'} dΩ is 1, due to normalization.

So the matrix element for each transition is proportional to 1/sqrt(4π).

But wait, that would mean that all transitions have the same matrix element. Hence, the same probability.

So the transition probabilities to each m' are the same: 1/3 each.

So the first step has each of the three possible m' with probability 1/3.

Then, the second step from each of these to |1,0,0⟩ again has a 1/3 probability for each.

So the total probability for each path (3→2, m' →1,0,0) is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But the options don't present 1/9 as the answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the possible transitions might not all be equally likely. Perhaps the transition probability depends on the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which might differ.

Wait, but earlier I thought the CG coefficients are the same for each transition, because combining l=0 and l=1 to l'=1, the coefficients are 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules don't allow certain m transitions.

Wait, another approach: in a hydrogen atom, the decay from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions would have specific allowed paths.

The first transition must involve l=1, so the first state is |2,1,m⟩. Then, the second transition must go to |1,0,0⟩.

So for each |2,1,m⟩, the dipole transition to |1,0,0⟩ is allowed only if m=0, because m must change by 0, ±1.

Wait, wait, no. The dipole transition allows Δm=0, ±1.

So from m, to 0, the allowed m's are m = 0, ±1.

So from |2,1,1⟩, m=1→0 is allowed (Δm=-1).

From |2,1,0⟩, m=0→0 is allowed (Δm=0).

From |2,1,-1⟩, m=-1→0 is allowed (Δm=+1).

So all three are allowed.

But the question is about the probability of each path.

Wait, perhaps the transition |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ is more probable than the others.

Because in the first transition, the dipole operator's m=0 component might have a higher matrix element.

Wait, another thought: the matrix element for the transition is proportional to the integral of Y_0^0 Y_1^{m} Y_1^{mu}.

Wait, but Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π), and Y_1^{m} and Y_1^{mu} are functions of theta and phi.

Wait, the integral is non-zero only when m = mu.

So for each m', the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_1^{m'} Y_1^{m'}.

Which is 1.

So the matrix element for each transition is the same, so each has a 1/3 chance.

But this leads back to each path having 1/9 probability.

But the options don't have 1/9, so perhaps the correct approach is to model the probabilities for each step.

Wait, another approach: the probability for the first transition to |2,1,0⟩ is 1/3, and the probability for the second transition is 1/3, so the total probability for this path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But the same applies to the other two paths, so the total overall probability across all three paths is 1/3.

But the question is about the transition route and corresponding probability. So each option is about a specific path, not the total.

But looking at the options, option A says the probability is 1/3, but that would imply that this path has 1/3 of the total probability, which would only be possible if all other paths don't contribute. But that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only one possible path. But why would that be?

Alternatively, perhaps the transitions are allowed via specific m values.

Wait, another thought: the selection rules might allow only certain m transitions.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the first transition goes to |2,1,m⟩, m=0,±1.

But the second transition must go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, which requires that m changes by -m to 0.

The matrix element for the second transition is proportional to the integral of Y_1^m Y_1^{mu} Y_0^0 dΩ.

Again, Y_0^0 is 1/sqrt(4π), and the integral is non-zero only when mu = -m.

So for each m, the transition is via a specific mu.

But the probability of each second transition would then depend on the square of the matrix element, which might be the same for each m.

So each second transition has a 1/3 probability.

So the probability for each path is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.

But the options don't have 1/9 as an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ is more probable because it's a lower change in m.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the first transition to |2,1,0⟩ is higher.

Wait, in reality, the transition probabilities for m=0 might be higher than for m=±1.

Because for m=0, the dipole operator's component is Y_1^0, which is real and symmetric around the z-axis, leading to a higher probability.

Whereas Y_1^{±1} have complex components and might have lower probabilities.

Hmm, so perhaps the transition to m'=0 is more probable than to m'=±1.

If that's the case, then the first transition probabilities are not equal.

So the first transition to m'=0 has a higher probability, say p0, and the transitions to m'=±1 have p1 each, with p0 + 2 p1 =1.

But how much higher is p0?

I think that the square of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for m=0 is higher than for m=±1.

Because the CG coefficients for l=0 and l=1 combining to l=1 are:

For m'=0: coefficient is 1.

For m'=±1: coefficients are sqrt(1/2).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think about the CG coefficients for combining |0,0⟩ and |1, m⟩. The result is |1, m⟩, and the coefficient is 1.

Wait, maybe that's not the right way to approach it.

Alternatively, the matrix element for the transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for |0,0⟩ and |1,m⟩ is 1 for each m.

But that can't be, because the sum of the squares would be 3, which is greater than 1.

So perhaps the matrix elements are normalized differently.

Wait, I think the transition probability is given by the square of the matrix element divided by some normalization factor.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Another approach: perhaps the probability for each m' is proportional to (2l +1) δ_{m, m'}, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each m' is (2 - δ_{m',0}) / 6.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

Looking at the options, options B and C have a probability of 1/4, and option A and D have 1/3 and 2/3 respectively.

But from my earlier analysis, each path should have a probability of 1/9, but none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that only one intermediate state is allowed.

Wait, that can't be right, because the selection rules allow three possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because the transition to m=0 is more probable, and the path via m=0 has a higher probability.

But why would that be?

Wait, another possibility: the transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,0⟩ can only happen via the dipole moment along the z-axis (Y_1^0), and the transition to |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩ can't happen because they require Y_1^{±1} which have imaginary components, leading to no net transition.

But that doesn't make sense because dipole transitions do allow m changes of ±1.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can only transition to |2,1,0⟩ because of symmetry reasons, making the probability 1.

But that would make the second transition, from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, probability 1, giving an overall probability of 1. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the first transition is only to m=0, so the probability is 1, and the second transition is again only m=0, so the total probability is 1.

But that's not reflected in the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the initial state |3,0,0⟩ can't transition directly to |2,1,0⟩ in one step because of some other selection rule.

Wait, no, the selection rules allow Δl=±1, so from l=0 to l=1 is allowed.

But I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which states that the transition is via |2,1,0⟩ with a probability of 1/3.

But wait, why would the probability be 1/3? Because the first step has three possible paths, each 1/3, and each second step is 1/3, so the total for each path is 1/9, but the option says 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for each step is 1/2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first transition has a probability of 1/2 to go to m=0, and 1/4 each for m=±1.

Then, the second transition from m=0 has a probability of 1/2, and from m=±1, 1/2 each.

But without knowing the exact probabilities, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because the transition to m=0 is more probable.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, looking at the options, option D's probability is 2/3, which is higher than others. Why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the first transition's probability for m=0 is higher, say 1/2, and the second transition's probability is 1/3, leading to 1/2 * 1/3 = 1/6. But that's not matching any option.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess.

From the options, option A and D involve the m=0 transition. From what I know, the transition via m=0 might be more probable because it's along the same axis, so perhaps the probability is higher.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the m=0 transition is the same as for m=±1.

In that case, the total probability for each path would be 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9, but since there are three such paths, the total is 1/3.

But the question is about a specific route, so the correct answer would be the one with probability 1/3, which is option A.

But wait, option A's probability is 1/3, which aligns with the first step's probability.

Wait, but the option says the probability is 1/3 for the entire decay process, which would mean that this path is 1/3 of the total possibilities. But the total decay could have other paths, but the question is only about this specific path.

Hmm. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is option A, but I'm not entirely certain.


The problem involves the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state in the hydrogen atom to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. The selection rules for dipole transitions dictate that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. The decay proceeds through an intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, where m can be 0, ±1. Each transition is governed by the overlap of spherical harmonics and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Transition (|3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,m⟩):**
   - The initial state |3,0,0⟩ (n=3, l=0, m=0) transitions to |2,1,m⟩ (n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1).
   - The selection rules allow m to change by Δm = 0, ±1, so the possible intermediate states are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩.
   - The transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which are proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These coefficients are equal for all three m values, implying that the probabilities for transitioning to |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩ are equal. Thus, each has a probability of 1/3.

2. **Second Transition (|2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩):**
   - From the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the transition to |1,0,0⟩ (n=1, l=0, m=0) is allowed because Δl = -1 and Δm = -m.
   - For each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, the transition probability to |1,0,0⟩ is also governed by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. These probabilities are equal for all three m values, so each has a probability of 1/3.

3. **Total Probability for Each Path:**
   - The total probability for a specific path (e.g., |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩) is the product of the probabilities of the two transitions:  
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}.
     \]
   - Since there are three such paths (via |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, and |2,1,-1⟩), the total probability across all paths is:
     \[
     P_{\text{total}} = 3 \times \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

4. **Interpreting the Options:**
   - **Option A:** The path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is given with a probability of 1/3. This matches the total probability of all paths, suggesting that this option represents the overall probability for the decay process.
   - **Option B and C:** These options describe paths via |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩, respectively, each with a probability of 1/4. This does not align with the calculated probabilities.
   - **Option D:** The path |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ is given with a probability of 2/3, which is inconsistent with the calculated probabilities.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent answer is **Option A**, as it aligns with the total probability of the decay process being 1/3. The other options do not match the calculated probabilities based on the selection rules and transition dynamics.
