Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in a solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate ions, and the stability constants for the complexes. 

Let me start by recalling what stability constants mean. Stability constants, or formation constants, measure how stable a complex is. The higher the beta value, the more stable the complex. So β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, but in what order are these complexes? I think the order is based on the number of SCN- ligands attached. Like, Co(SCN)n^2− where n is 1,2,3,4. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, and so on.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I believe is the tetra SCN complex. Because I remember that the blue color in the cobalt thiocyanate complexes is for the [Co(SCN)4]^2− ion. But wait, is that correct? Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the blue color is for the [Co(SCN)4]^2−, which is the tetrathiocyanato complex.
