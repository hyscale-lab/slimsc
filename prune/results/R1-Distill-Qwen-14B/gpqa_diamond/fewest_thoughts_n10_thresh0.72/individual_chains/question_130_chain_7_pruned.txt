Okay, so I have this question about large clouds of neutral hydrogen and quasars. Hmm. Let me think about what I know. So, the question is about the redshift required for these clouds to be detected using optical ground-based telescopes.

I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and when their light passes through neutral hydrogen clouds, the hydrogen absorbs specific wavelengths, like the Lyman-alpha line. The Lyman-alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, right?

Wait, but wait. When a quasar's light passes through a cloud with a certain redshift, the absorption line we see here on Earth would be shifted. So, the observed wavelength depends on the redshift. The formula I think is λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But optical telescopes, like the ones on the ground, can't detect wavelengths beyond a certain point. Because the atmosphere absorbs certain kinds of light, right? I remember something about the Earth's atmosphere being opaque to certain infrared and ultraviolet rays. Oh right, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere blocks it. So the maximum wavelength they can observe is in the optical range.

Wait, what's the cutoff? So, for ground-based optical telescopes, the observed wavelength must be less than about 900 nm or 9000 Angstroms? No, wait, wait. I think the visible spectrum is from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But
