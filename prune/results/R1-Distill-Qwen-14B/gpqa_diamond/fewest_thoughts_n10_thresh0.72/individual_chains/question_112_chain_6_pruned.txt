Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I know that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which means they form the basis for our state. So, the first thing I should probably do is normalize this state because the problem states that it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking about the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does that matrix look like?

Since the operator is defined in the same basis as |up> and |down>, which are two-dimensional, the matrix would be 2x2. Let me think: for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix A would be:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, but wait, that's for a 2x2 matrix. So the operator is something like A = (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix? Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1s on the off-diagonal. So yeah, A would be (hbar/2) * σ_x.

But wait, what's the significance of this operator? Since it's a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and off-diagonal elements, that probably means it's a spin operator in the x-direction or something else. But wait, no, the spin in the x-direction is (ħ/2) σ_x, which matches this. So this operator A is the spin operator in the x-direction.

Wait no, wait. Because the matrix A is zero on the diagonal and (hbar/2) off-diagonal. So the operator is (hbar/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is exactly the Pauli X matrix scaled by hbar/2. So yes, this is the spin-x operator, which has eigenstates as the eigenstates of the x-direction spin.

So the eigenstates of operator A are the eigenstates of spin in the x-direction. So when the question asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A, I think it's asking for the probabilities of the two possible outcomes when measuring the spin in the x-direction. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenstates are the |+x> and |-x> states.

Wait, but wait. The problem is phrased as "eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij..." So the eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes, and the eigenstates are the states corresponding to each outcome.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, I need to project the state |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A, and then take the square of the magnitude of the projection coefficients to get the probabilities.

But before that, I need to make sure that |alpha> is normalized. Because right now, it's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So let's calculate the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2). Let me compute that.

|1+i| squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2.
|2-i| squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5.
So the sum is 2+5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, all multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Now, the next step is to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. Because A is the spin-x operator scaled by hbar/2, but wait, no. Wait, operator A is equal to (hbar/2) * σ_x. Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so when you multiply by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Wait no, wait. The matrix A is given as Aij = hbar/
