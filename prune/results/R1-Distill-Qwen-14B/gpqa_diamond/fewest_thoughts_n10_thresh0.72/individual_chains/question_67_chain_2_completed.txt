Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum, so we're only dealing with the orbital part. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. I remember that l is the orbital quantum number, which for p orbitals is 1. So each electron has l=1, and the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, with m being -1.

The question asks: if we measure the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z, what's the probability of getting both eigenvalues as -ħ? The options are A to D, with D being 0.

Hmm, okay. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is being measured. The state is a coupled state, so I think it's a combination of the individual states of the two electrons.

Wait a second, when dealing with angular momentum coupling, the state |l1, l2, l, m> is a combination of all possible ways the individual states can combine to give the total l and m. But here, we have l1 = l2 =1, so each has m1 and m2 values.

The total m for the system is m = m1 + m2. In this case, m is -1. So the sum of the individual m's is -1.

Each electron's orbital angular momentum is given by L_z = mħ. So for electron 1, if m1 is -1, L1z would be -ħ. Similarly for electron 2, m2 is 0 because (-1) + 0 = -1. Wait, no, because m1 + m2 = -1. So possible pairs (m1, m2) could be (-1, 0), (0, -1), etc. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, in the coupled state, how is that built up?

Wait, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of all possible |m1, m2> states such that m1 + m2 = m = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1). Because 1 and 1 can combine to give m up to 2, down to -2.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of these two states: |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, no, wait. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here. The state |l1, l2, l, m> is a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = m.

In this case, l=2, m=-1. So the state would be a combination of |m1= -1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> because their sum is -1.

The question is about the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. That would mean that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because L_z for each is mħ. So each would have m=-1. So m1 = m2 = -1. But wait, m1 + m2 would be -2, but in our case, the total m is -1. So that's impossible because if m1 and m2 are both -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the total m of -1.

Wait, so the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include any component where both m1 and m2 are -1. Because in that case, m1 + m2 would be -2, not -1. So the state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of the state |l=2, m=-1>. So if we measure L1z and L2z, and find both to be -ħ, that would require m1 = m2 = -1. But our coupled state doesn't have any of that component. So the probability is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. Could the coupled state have any part where both m's are -1? Let's see. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 (p orbitals) to get l=2 and m=-1.

The general formula for the coupling is:

|l1, l2, l, m> = sum over m1, m2 [ <m1, m2 | m, m'> ] |m1, m2>

Wait, but in our case, l is 2, m is -1. So the state is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs are ( -1, 0 ), ( 0, -1 ), ( 1, -2 ) but wait, m can't be beyond -1 for each, since l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So (1, -2) is not possible because m2 can't be -2 if l2=1. So only the first two possibilities.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

Wait, but what about the coefficients? I think for l=2, m=-1, the state is made up of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> with some coefficients.

So when you have a state that's a sum of these two states, any measurement of L1z and L2z would yield either m1=-1 and m2=0 or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the possible outcomes are either L1z = -ħ, L2z=0ħ or L1z=0ħ, L2z=-ħ.

In either case, the sum is -ħ. But the question is about getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ. That would require m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, which is not part of the state. So the probability is zero.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could the state have any other components? Because for l=2, m=-1, the state is a combination of two basis states. So any measurement would only give those possibilities.

So the probability of both m's being -1 is zero because that component isn't present in the state. Therefore, the joint probability is zero.

Looking back at the options, option D is 0. So the answer should be D.


The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, with their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers $l_1 = l_2 = 1$. The coupled angular momentum state is given as $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$. This state represents a combination of all possible $|m_1, m_2\rangle$ states such that $m_1 + m_2 = m = -1$. The possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$, as these satisfy the condition $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. 

The question asks for the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$. For this to happen, both $m_1$ and $m_2$ would need to be $-1$, which would imply $m_1 + m_2 = -2$. However, the given coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not include any component where $m_1 = m_2 = -1$, as this would violate the total $m = -1$ condition. Therefore, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.

Answer: D
