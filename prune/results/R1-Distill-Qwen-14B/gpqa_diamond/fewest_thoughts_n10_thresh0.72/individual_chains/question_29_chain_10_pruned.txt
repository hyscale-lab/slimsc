Okay, so I've got this question about barley genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The key here is probably to look for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. Since the compound is bad, we want to inactivate the gene. So maybe a frameshift or a nonsense mutation that creates a premature stop codon would do the trick. But I also need to look at the exons because introns are spliced out, so mutations in introns might not affect the protein as much. Wait, but the question says they sequenced the target gene, which includes exons and introns? Or are they looking at exons only? No, probably the entire gene including exons and introns.

Wait, no, the target gene would consist of exons and introns. But the question says they changed the first exon area. So the mutations are in the exons. So any mutation in exons could affect the protein.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change in the beginning of the sequence, first exon. Let's look at each mutation and see if it causes a frameshift or disrupts the reading frame.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Each mutant has a different change:

Mutant 1: the sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Compare with intact: So, the change is in the third position. Let me count letters.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Wait, let me check each base.

Looking at the first part of each:

Intact: positions 1-20: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT
