Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So, the question is about an alien spacecraft traveling at a very high speed towards Earth. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to figure out how long the trip will take from their perspective.

Wait, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So, the astronaut's own time (proper time) will be less than the time observed from Earth. But wait, no, actually, I think it's the other way around. No, wait, let me get this right.

Time dilation formula is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where tau is the proper time (the astronaut's time), and t is the time measured in the Earth's frame. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the spaceship's clock runs slower from Earth's perspective, but from the spaceship's frame, Earth is moving. So, the astronaut's own time is the proper time, so tau is less than t.

Wait, the problem says we need to find the time from the astronaut's perspective. So we have to calculate the proper time, which is tau.

The distance is the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact figure. Let me think. I remember that the Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million light-years away, and the LMC is much closer. Oh right, it's approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth.

So the distance D is about 163,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is v = 0.99999987 c. That's very close to the speed of light.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. Also, the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years, which is way more than 22, so perhaps that's a red herring. The question is about the time experienced by the astronaut, so their perspective is the proper time.

So, let's model this. The time experienced by the astronaut is tau = D / v, but adjusted for time dilation. Wait, no, because from the spaceship's frame, the distance is contracted. So, the time it takes from their perspective is D' / v, where D' is the contracted distance.

Wait, I think another approach is to calculate the time as observed from Earth, which would be t = D / v. Then, the proper time tau is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, isn't that correct? Because from Earth's frame, the spaceship is moving, so the spaceship's clock runs slower. So tau = t * sqrt(...).

Alternatively, from the spaceship's frame, the distance is contracted. So the distance they perceive is D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the time is (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The formula for time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t_earth is the time measured from Earth.

Alternatively, since the astronaut is moving relative to Earth, the distance they're traveling is length-contracted. So from their perspective, the distance is D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then, the time they experience is that contracted distance divided by their speed.

Either way, the result should be the same. Let me do it step by step.

First, calculate t_earth: the time it takes from Earth's perspective. Since D is 163,000 light-years, and v is 0.99999987 c, so the time is D / v in Earth's frame.

t_earth = D / v = (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since light-year is distance, and speed is c, the time in years is (163,000) / (0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 / 1 ≈ 163,000 years. Wait, but that can't be right because 0.99999987 is almost 1, so t_earth is roughly 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 163,000 years, but I think even more precisely, it's just a tiny bit more than 163,000. But that's a huge number.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the astronaut's own time (tau) would be much less. Because tau is t_earth multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm, let's compute that.

But wait, v is 0.99999987 c, so v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared:

Well, 1e-6 is 0.000001. 0.999999 is 1 - 1e-6. So (1 - 1e-6)^2 ≈ 1 - 2e-6 + 1e-12. But wait, the v is 0.99999987 c, which is 1 - (1.3e-7) approximately? Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013, so 1.3e-7.

So (v/c)^2 is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute it accurately.

(1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. Since (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible (like 1.69e-14), we can ignore it. So, approximately, 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = approx 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that. sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.612e-3.5. Wait, 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001. 3.5 is between 3 and 4, so 1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.1e-4.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So tau = t_earth * 5.1e-4.

But t_earth is about 163,000 years. Wait, but wait, no, because t_earth is D / v. Let me compute it more precisely.

t_earth = D / v = 163,000 ly / (0.99999987 c) = (163,000 / 0.99999987) years, since c is 1 ly/year. So 163,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7), because 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x.

So 163,000 * 1.0000013 ≈ 163,000 + 163,000*1.3e-7.

163,000 * 1.3e-7 = (163,000 * 1.3) * 1e-7 = approximately 211,900 * 1e-7 = 0.02119. So t_earth ≈ 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ approximately 163,000.021 years. So about 163,000 years.

So tau = t_earth * 5.1e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 0.00051 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5 years.

163,000 * 0.00001 = 1.63 years.

Wait, 5.1e-4 is 0.00051, which is 0.51 thousandths.

So 163,000 * 0.00051 = (163,000 * 0.0005) + (163,000 * 0.00001) ) = 81.5 + 1.63 = 83.13 years.

Wait, but I think I made a miscalculation because 5.1e-4 is 0.00051, so 0.0005 is 50%, so 81.5. 0.00001 is 1.63, so together 83.13.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options given are around 77, 72, 81, etc. So 83 is close to 81, but maybe the exact calculation would give a different number.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 163,000 * 0.00051:

163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5

163,000 * 0.00001 = 1.63

Adding them together: 81.5 + 1.63 = 83.13 years.

But wait, perhaps the exact value of sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is a bit more precise. Let me recalculate that.

v = 0.99999987 c

So (v/c) = 0.99999987

v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute it more accurately. 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Well, (1 - x)^2 = 1 - 2x + x², where x is 1.3e-7.

So 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈ 2.6e-7 (since the second term is negligible).

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) = (2.6e-7)^0.5.

The square root of 2.6 is approximately 1.612, so 1.612 * (1e-7)^0.5.

But (1e-7)^0.5 is 1e-3.5, which is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.1e-4, as before.

So tau is 163,000 * 0.00051 ≈ 83.13 years.

But the options are 72, 77, 81, or 77. Wait, wait, the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B) 72.

C) 81.

D) 77.

Hmm, 83 is not an option, but the closest is C) 81.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Because the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away, but sometimes the figure is approximated as 160,000. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the exact value varies, but in the problem statement, they probably used 160,000 light-years.

If the distance is 160,000 ly, then t_earth would be 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + 20.8e-3 ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So tau = 160,000 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000 * 5.1e-4.

160,000 * 0.00051 = 81.6 years.

Which is approximately 81.6, so option C is 81 years.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the time experienced from the spaceship's frame. So the distance is contracted, and the time is (contracted distance) / v.

Contracted distance is D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 160,000 * 0.00051 = 81.6 ly.

So time is 81.6 ly / v, where v is 0.99999987 c. Since v is almost c, 81.6 / 0.99999987 ≈ approx 81.6 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 81.6 + 0.0106 ≈ 81.6106 years.

So about 81.6 years, which is about 81.6, so option C is 81.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. So if the trip takes about 81 years from their perspective, their age upon arrival would be 22 + 81 = 103 years. But the average lifetime is 150 years, so maybe they survive, so option A is not correct.

But let me look at the options again.

Option A says the astronaut will die before reaching. If the trip takes about 81 years, and they are 22, they'd be 103. Assuming the average lifetime is 150, they would live, so A is incorrect.

So the correct answer is option C, 81 years.

Wait, but wait another thought: I think I might have made a mistake in computing t_earth.

Wait, t_earth is (distance) / (v). Distance is 160,000 ly. v is 0.99999987c. So time in years is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1.0000013) approximately 160,000.021 years. So about 160,000 years.

But tau is t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000 * 5.1e-4 ≈ 81.6 years.

But wait, that's the proper time. So the astronaut would age about 81 years, starting at 22, ending at 103. So option C is correct.

But another thing to think about is that the age of the astronaut is given as 22, but the average lifetime is 150. So 22 + 81 = 103 < 150, so he survives. So option A is wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) 81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut will take to reach Earth from their perspective, we use the concept of time dilation from Einstein's theory of relativity. The astronaut's proper time, \( \tau \), is related to the time measured in Earth's frame, \( t_{\text{Earth}} \), by the formula:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( t_{\text{Earth}} \)
The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately \( D = 160,000 \, \text{ly} \). The spacecraft travels at a speed \( v = 0.99999987c \). The time measured from Earth's frame is:

\[
t_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years (neglecting the small correction factor)}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \)
The term \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \) accounts for time dilation. Since \( v = 0.99999987c \), we compute:

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 1 - 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:

\[
\tau = t_{\text{Earth}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,000 \cdot 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 4: Verify the astronaut's survival
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. Upon arrival, their age would be:

\[
22 + 81.6 \approx 103 \, \text{years}.
\]

Since the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the trip.

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The astronaut will not die before reaching Earth.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The time is closer to 81 years, not 72.
- **Option C**: Correct. The proper time is approximately 81 years.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The time is closer to 81 years, not 77.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) 81 years**.
