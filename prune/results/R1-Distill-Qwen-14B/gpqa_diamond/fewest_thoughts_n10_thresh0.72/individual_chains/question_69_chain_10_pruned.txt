Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking for the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy of the setup is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma times tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But how does that relate to the resolution? Oh right, I think the resolution refers to the precision of the detector in measuring the position where the decay occurs. If the particle is moving quickly, it can travel a longer distance before decaying. So the minimum resolution is the distance the particle travels before decaying, so that we can see the decay products.

Wait, no—the resolution would need to be such that the detector can distinguish the position where the decay happens. So if the particle's lifetime is too long, it might move too far, and the decay products would be spread out beyond the detector's resolution, making it hard to observe the decay. Or wait, maybe it's about the time it takes for the detector to resolve the event.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the average path length the particle travels before decaying. The formula for average decay length is c * gamma * tau_0 * beta. Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c.

So first, I need to find gamma. Gamma is the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E / (m c²). But since the units are in GeV and mass is given in GeV/c², maybe I don't need to worry about the c² term here.

Wait, E is given as 27 GeV, and mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3
