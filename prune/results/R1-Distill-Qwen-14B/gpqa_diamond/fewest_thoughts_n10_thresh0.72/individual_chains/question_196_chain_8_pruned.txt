Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical equations anymore. I need to think about how relativity affects the motion.

The question is about the maximum speed of the mass. In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so classical mechanics might not apply here.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it's the total energy which includes rest mass energy. The total energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy.

Wait, but wait. In the harmonic oscillator, energy is quantized, but this seems to be a classical problem. Oh, right, the question says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, so it's a classical oscillator with relativistic considerations.

So in the classical case without relativity, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic is (1/2)mv². At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all energy is potential, and at equilibrium (x=0), all is kinetic. But when velocities approach the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant.

So the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure how to model this. Maybe I should use the concept of the total energy in relativity.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is sqrt(kA²/m). But when relativistic effects are considered, the kinetic energy can't be treated as (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy: KE = (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, but in the relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So at maximum amplitude, the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the kinetic energy is maximum, which is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

Wait, but in the oscillator, as the mass moves, it converts potential into kinetic energy. So the total energy (E) is the sum of rest energy and the oscillator's energy. So E = m c² + (1/2)kA². Hmm, that might be. Because the oscillator's energy is (1/2)kA², and the rest energy is m c².

So when the mass is at x=0, all the oscillator's energy is kinetic, but relativistically, the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = E - m c² = (1/2
