Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Hmm, Grubbs catalyst... I think that's used for olefin metathesis reactions. Yeah, I remember something about it breaking and reforming double bonds.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent means five carbons, and the double bond is at position 1. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Or wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. 3-methyl would mean a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2? Wait, but that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but wait, does that make sense? Let's count the carbons. The main chain is five, with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So carbon 3 has a methyl branch.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Now, Grubbs catalyst usually does ring-closing metathesis or ring-opening, or maybe it's cross-metathesis. Wait, what's the general reaction when Grubbs is used on an alkene?

Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically for olefin metathesis. So it causes the breaking and re-forming of double bonds. In this case,
