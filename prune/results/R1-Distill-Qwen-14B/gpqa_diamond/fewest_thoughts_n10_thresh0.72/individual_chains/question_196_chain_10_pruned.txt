Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It's obeying Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. And we need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, right, in a harmonic oscillator, whether classical or quantum, the speed is maximum when the displacement is zero, right? Because that's where the potential energy is lowest, and kinetic energy is highest. Oh wait, no, actually, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at displacement A, so the kinetic energy (and hence speed) would be maximum when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position, x=0.

But wait, this is a relativistic oscillator. So I think relativistic effects come into play when the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the usual equations from classical mechanics might not apply because they assume velocities much less than c.

In the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's non-relativistic. Since this is relativistic, we have to consider how the kinetic energy and momentum change with velocity.

In special relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So for the oscillator, the total mechanical
