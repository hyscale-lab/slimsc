Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this quasar question. Let me see. The question is about the comoving distance of a quasar based on observations in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that wavelength. Hmm, I remember that in quasars, a peak in the near-infrared could be related to the Lyman-alpha emission line, but wait, Lyman-alpha is in the UV, right? Oh wait, no, maybe it's the Lyman-break galaxy effect. So, the Lyman break occurs when the intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts absorbs UV light, causing a sharp drop in flux below a certain wavelength. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that might mean that the wavelength we're seeing corresponds to a rest-frame UV emission being redshifted into the infrared.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm in the rest frame. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then the redshift z would be (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5, so z is about 5.5. Hmm, that's a high redshift. So the quasar is at a redshift z ≈5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is the distance to an object at a certain redshift, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance is D_c = (1+z) * the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(x)) dx, where E(x) is the Hubble parameter at scale factor x, which is sqrt(Ω_r x^2 + Ω_m x^-3 + Ω_k x^2 + Ω_lambda). Wait, but in the given universe, the parameters are Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7, and it's flat (so Ω_k=0). And the Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

So the integral is from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(x)) dx, multiplied by (1+z). So I need to compute this.

I remember that for a flat universe with
