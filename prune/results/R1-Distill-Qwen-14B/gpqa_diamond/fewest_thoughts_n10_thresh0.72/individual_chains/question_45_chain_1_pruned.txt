Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, okay, let's think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to piece it together.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the problem gives E as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), which is the base unit. So E is basically E_1 for a single particle in the ground state.

Wait, so E_n = n² E, because E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3=9E, and so on. So each particle's energy depends on its quantum number n squared times E.

Now, the particles are identical spin-1/2 particles. Spin-1/2 means they're fermions, right? So they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But wait, since it's a 1D well, what defines the quantum state? The quantum number n and the spin. Oh wait, spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles with different spins.

So the problem is about four particles. Let's think about how they would fill up the energy levels. Each state can hold two particles: one spin up, one spin down.

Ground state: We want the lowest energy possible. So the particles will fill the lowest energy states first.

So for four particles:

- The first two particles will go into the n=1 state, each with opposite spins. So that's 2 particles with n=1. So their total energy is 2 * E_1 = 2E.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait a second. Each particle in the same n level contributes E_n once. Wait, no, if two particles are in the same n but different spins, that's allowed. So for the ground state, all four particles can't be in n=1 because each n can have two particles. So n=1 can hold 2, n=2 can hold 2, right?

Wait, four particles. So n=1 can take two (spin up and down), n=2 can take two, so that's all four. So in the ground state, two particles are in n=1, two in n=2.

So the total energy is 2*E_1 + 2*E_2. E_1 is E, E_2 is (
