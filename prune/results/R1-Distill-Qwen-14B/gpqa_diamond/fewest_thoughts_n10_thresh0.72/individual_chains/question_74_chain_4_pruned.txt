Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, but there's some probability involved. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying within a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed for a certain period already.

Let me read the problem again. So, we have an atom that has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, okay, so the initial time was 100 minutes, and the probability of decay by then is 32%. But 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom is still there. So, the remaining time is 50 minutes from the initial point? Or is it 150 minutes from now? Wait, the question says "the next 150 minutes." So the next 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes into the 100-minute period. That would make the total time from the start 50 +150 =200 minutes. Or wait, noâ€”wait, the initial 100 minutes was the time frame for the 32% probability. So perhaps the decay probability is given for 100 minutes, and it's a half-life or something else.

Wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think. Radioactive decay is typically modeled with an exponential decay law. The probability that a
