Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have an atom that's supposed to decay with a probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? The options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

Hmm. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. The key idea is that the probability of decay is independent of the time already passed. So, each atom has a certain probability per unit time of decaying, and the total probability over a time period is based on that rate.

Wait, wait. So the decay probability over a time period is given by P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. Alternatively, because the decay is a Poisson process, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt), and the probability it has decayed is 1 minus that.

The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So P(100) = 0.32. That means 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100), right? Or wait, no, actually, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. It says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's the probability that the atom decays in that 100-minute period.

So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me solve for λ. Rearranging, e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, ln(0.68) is negative, so
