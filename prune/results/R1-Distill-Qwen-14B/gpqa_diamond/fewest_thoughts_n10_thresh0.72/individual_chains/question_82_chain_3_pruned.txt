Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of the major isomer of product 3. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclooctatetraene. I remember that cyclooctatetraene is a strained molecule because it's a eight-membered ring with four double bonds, which might make it more reactive.

First reaction: Cyclooctatetraene is heated with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1. Oh wait, maleic anhydride is a dienophile. So this sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated diene? Or maybe it's acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder. Alternatively, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of ring-opening or addition reaction.

Wait, cyclooctatetraene is a non-aromatic compound because of its 8 pi electrons. It's a tub-shaped molecule, I think. When it's heated, maybe it undergoes some conformation change or becomes more reactive.

But when reacting with maleic anhydride, which is a good dienophile, perhaps the cyclooctatetraene acts as a diene. But I'm not sure because cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated diene, but I'm trying to imagine how it would fit into a Diels-Alder. Alternatively, maybe it undergoes an electrocyclic ring-opening.

Wait, cyclooctatetraene can undergo electrocyclic ring-opening when heated. So in the first step, heating with maleic anhydride, maybe it's an example of a [4+2] cycloaddition, but perhaps the cyclooctatetraene is opening up to form a diene that can react with the dienophile.

Wait, another thought: cyclooctatetraene is a diene, so maybe it undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with maleic anhydride, which is a dienophile. But the diene in Diels-Alder is a conjugated diene, which cyclooctat
