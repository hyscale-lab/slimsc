Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Let me take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that structure. So it's a cyclohexanone ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH attached. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is also known as isopropenyl, right? So that's like a CH2-C(CH2)=CH2 group? Wait, wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at 1. Let me think. Oh wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2 but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-? Wait, no. The substituent is attached at position 2. Oh wait, the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)-. So it's probably an allyl group. So the substituent at position 5 is an isopropenyl group, which is a substituted vinyl group.

So the starting molecule has a cyclohexanone ring, substituents at 3 and 5. Now, the first step is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So I think this is an alkylation reaction. The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group, which is an -OH attached to a CH2 group. But wait, the -OH is on a cyclohexane ring that's a ketone. So the position is 3: 3-(hydroxymethyl). So the structure is cyclohexanone with substituents at 3 (hydroxymethyl) and 5 (isopropenyl).

In the presence of a strong base like Na
