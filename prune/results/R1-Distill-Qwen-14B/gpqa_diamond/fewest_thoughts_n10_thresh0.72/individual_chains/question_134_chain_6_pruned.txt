Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. Since it's a neutralization reaction, it's usually exothermic, so the enthalpy should be negative. The options are in kcal and kJ, so I need to be careful about the units.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I think when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. But I'm not sure how to handle the mixing of all three.

Let me write down the data:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

I need to find the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base. The reaction will depend on which is in excess, right? Because the limiting reagent will determine how much neutralization occurs.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but I think it's diprotic. So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base too and will dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions.

So calculating the moles:

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters)

For HCl:
Moles HCl = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl → H+ + Cl-, moles H+ = 0.1.

For H2SO4:
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so moles H+ = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

For Ba(OH)2:
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻, yes. So 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 give 0.2 moles of OH⁻.

So now, H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. Which is the limiting reactant?

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each mole of H+ needs one mole of OH-.

We have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. Because 0.2 OH- can neutralize 0.2 H+.

Wait, wait. No. Let me think again. If there's 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-, the OH- will run out first. So all 0.2 OH- will react with 0.2 H+, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted. But wait, what about the excess H+? They will still be in solution, but since the base is all used up, that's the extent of the neutralization.

Wait, but wait. The enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So the maximum amount of neutralization possible is 0.2 moles (since OH- is 0.2). So the reaction will release heat based on
