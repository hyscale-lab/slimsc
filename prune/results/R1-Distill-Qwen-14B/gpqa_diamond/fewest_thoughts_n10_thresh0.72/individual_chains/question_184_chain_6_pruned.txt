Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to get from benzene to this target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering... I think substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro? Or wait, is it the other way around? Let me see: 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So positions 1, 2, 3 are all substituted.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering starts at the ethoxy group as position 1. Then moving clockwise, the next position is 2, which has the tert-butyl. Then position 3 would be the nitro group. So the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 positions.

Now, the problem is to find the correct sequence of reactions starting from benzene. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So I need to figure out the order in which these groups are introduced because the order affects where the substituents end up, especially with directing effects.

In benzene substitution reactions, substituents can be activating or deactivating and meta or para directors. Let's think about each group. 

The ethoxy group (OCH2CH2CH3) is an activating group because it's an electron-donating ether. It directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. 

The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. 

The tert-butyl group is an activating, since it's an alkyl group, so it donates electrons through induction. Alkyl groups are activating and direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions.

Wait, but wait, the target molecule has three substituents on benzene. So how do they get added?

I think
