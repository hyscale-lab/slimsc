Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit involved, but I'll take it slowly.

First, the problem says that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, what does that mean? Well, I remember that substances which decolorize bromine water are typically those with unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes. These can undergo addition reactions with bromine, causing the solution to decolorize. So, mixture X probably contains two alkenes or an alkene and something else with double bonds.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction which forms mixture Y. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So, Y has no double bonds? Because if they don't decolorize bromine, they probably don't have the same kind of unsaturation. Unless they have a different type, but maybe it's a saturated compound.

Wait, but the problem says it's a result of a disproportionation reaction. Oh, right, disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, in this case, the starting materials (mixture X) must have some species that can undergo such a reaction. Platinum is a catalyst, so probably a hydrogenation or dehydrogenation process.

Wait, but the treatment is heating with platinum. Oh! Maybe it's hydrogenation. But wait, when you hydrogenate something, you add hydrogen. Oh, but the question says that when mixture X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y. So, X is being hydrogenated to form Y.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So, Y must have single bonds where X had double bonds. So, X has alkenes, Y has alkanes? Because alkanes don't have double bonds, so they wouldn't react with bromine water.

Wait, but the question says Y has two liquids. So, X is two alkenes, and Y is their hydrogenated products, which would be alkanes. But alkanes are usually not liquids at room temperature unless they have a high molecular weight. But wait, maybe they're cyclic or something else.

Wait, but the problem also says that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only one
