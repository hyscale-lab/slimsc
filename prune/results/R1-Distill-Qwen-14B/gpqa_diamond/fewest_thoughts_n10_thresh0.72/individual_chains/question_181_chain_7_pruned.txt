Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see... The question is about the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago. 

Hmm, first, I remember that the Sun's energy production is based on the proton-proton chain, and that the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches are different stages of this process. The pp-III branch is the dominant one, I think. So if that stops, what happens to the neutrinos?

Wait, neutrinos are produced mainly in the proton-proton chain. The pp-I branch produces some neutrinos, and the pp-III branch produces a lot more because it's the main pathway. So if the pp-III stops, the number of neutrinos produced should drop, but the question is about the ratio between two specific energy bands.

The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I'm trying to recall the neutrino energy distributions. I think the neutrinos from the pp-III branch have higher energies than those from the pp-I branch. So if the pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would decrease more than the lower ones.

Wait, let's think about neutrino production. The pp-III branch produces the bulk of the neutrinos. So if it
