Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting these spectra. Let's see what the question says.

The question gives me an unknown organic compound and its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. I need to figure out which one it is based on the NMR peaks provided.

Alright, the NMR data is as follows:
- 7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz.
- 5.5 ppm: 1H, a doublet of quadruplets? Wait, 'dq'—I think that stands for doublet of quintets? Or maybe doublet of quadruplets? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the notation, but I'll think about what that implies.
- 2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet. That's probably the acetate group's methyl, since acetates typically have a singlet around 2 ppm.
- 1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to something else, maybe an oxygen or another CH2?

Let me start by breaking down the possible structures. The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates, cis or trans. So let's recall what those structures look like.

Propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CH-OAc, but wait, no—the acetate is the ester group. Wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2? No, wait. Propenyl group is CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Oh wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? Wait, no. Wait, propenyl acetate is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, no. Wait, acetate esters are R-O-CO-O-R, no? Wait, no, acetate is an ester where the acyl part is from acetic acid. So propenyl acetate would be where the propenyl group is attached to the oxygen. So, propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond. Wait, propenyl has three carbons with a double bond. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is
