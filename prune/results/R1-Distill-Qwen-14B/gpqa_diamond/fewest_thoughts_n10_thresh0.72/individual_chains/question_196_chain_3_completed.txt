Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is when the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are a bit different. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's a relativistic version of the simple harmonic oscillator.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal, v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the classical case. The question is relativistic, so I probably can't use that directly.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy including rest mass energy. So the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but for a relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy is more complicated.

Wait, no. In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv². Instead, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy E of the oscillator at maximum speed is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, but wait, another way: the total mechanical energy is conserved, so the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy (plus rest energy? Or not? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.)

Wait, in the classical case, maximum speed is when potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, the rest energy is always present. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is potential. When it's at x=0, all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest energy. So the total energy E would be (gamma) mc², and the potential energy U is (1/2)k A². So when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so E is all kinetic. So E = (gamma) mc² = U_max + K. But wait, when x = A, U_max is (1/2)k A², and K is zero, so E = U_max + (1/2)mv²? No, wait, that's the classical approach.

Wait, maybe the relativistic total energy is the sum of the rest energy and kinetic energy. So, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)k A² (the maximum potential energy) plus the rest energy mc². So E = mc² + (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all of this is converted into kinetic energy. So the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy:

E = mc² + K.

But K is the relativistic kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1) mc².

So putting it together: mc² + (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)k A² + mc².

Wait, subtract mc² from both sides: (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

So gamma -1 = (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me rearrange that. Let me call (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let's say that term is 'a' for now.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + a.

Wait, but if a is (k A²)/(2 m c²), then 1 + a = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + a) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))² ].

So,

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ) ]

Hmm, let me compute this expression.

Alternatively, maybe I should write it as:

v = c * sqrt(1 - [ 1/( (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ) ] )

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate it differently.

Let me compute the denominator. Let me write (1 + a)^2 where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + a)^2.

Which can be written as [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2a + a² -1 ) = 2a + a².

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator: a(2 + a).

Denominator: (1 + a)^2.

Wait, but wait, a is (k A²)/(2 m c^2), which may be small unless the amplitude is large. But in any case, perhaps I can factor this as:

v²/c² = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options, option D is v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Which is exactly what I have. Because:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + a)^2 ] )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ] )

Looking at the options, that's option D.

Wait, let me look again.

Option D: v_max = c√[1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))² ]

Yes, exactly. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option B is c√[1 + 1/(1 - (k A²/(2 m c^2)) ) ].

Hmm, that's different. Or option A has 1 + 1/(1 - ... ), which doesn't fit.

So yes, I think option D is the correct one.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system's energy conservation. In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) includes the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the kinetic energy, which is expressed as \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. The total energy is conserved and equals the maximum potential energy at \( x = A \), which is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \).

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic. Thus, the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2.
\]

Subtracting \( mc^2 \) from both sides:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

The Lorentz factor is also given by \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the two expressions for \( \gamma \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + a}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + a)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are inconsistent with the relativistic energy conservation and the correct expression for \( \gamma \).

Answer: D
