Okay, so I've got this science question to tackle. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the planets are Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses are known. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Wait, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger, but in this case, they're evolved. Oh wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. So I think evolved stars might expand, but in this case, both stars have the same radius. Hmm, okay.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Oh right, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to our line of sight. But I think there's a formula for the probability of a transit.

I recall the formula for the probability (P) of a transit is roughly (R_p / a) * (1/(something)), but wait, maybe it's (R_p / a) * (some function). Or perhaps the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the star's radius? Or maybe it's considering the size of the star and the planet.

Wait, the transit probability (assuming circular orbits) is given by P = (R_p / a) * (1 / (e^2 + ...)), but since e is zero here (they have circular orbits), it's just P = (R_p / a) * (something else). Or maybe I'm mixing it up. 

Wait, I think the transit probability is actually (R_p / a) * (1 / sin i), but no, that depends on the inclination. Wait, no, that's not it. Maybe I should think about the geometry.

The transit occurs when
