Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means there's a ketone group (ethan-1-one) attached to a benzene ring which has two substituents: a bromo group at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, benzene is a ring with six carbons, so numbering would be 1, 3, and 5 positions? Or wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring, with the ketone attached to the ring as well. So the structure is a benzene ring where position 1 has the ketone (attached to a methyl group?), but wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-... Wait, no. Ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, so the ring has a ketone group attached.

Wait, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. Because in benzene rings, substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So if the ketone is in position 1, then the bromo would be at 3 and nitro at 5. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is in position 1, and the other substituents are in 3 and 5 positions on the ring.

So starting from benzene, I need to introduce the three substituents in the correct order. Let me think about how functional groups are introduced. Remember, when adding substituents to benzene, the order matters because activating and deactivating groups can affect the next substitution.

Nitration and bromination are common reactions. But I need to consider the directing effects of each group.

The target has a nitro group (meta director) and a bromine (which is ortho/para director but since it's on the ring, wait, noâ€”the bromine is attached to the ring. Wait, no, the bromine is a substituent on the ring. Oh wait no, the substituents are the nitro and bromo groups, and the ketone
