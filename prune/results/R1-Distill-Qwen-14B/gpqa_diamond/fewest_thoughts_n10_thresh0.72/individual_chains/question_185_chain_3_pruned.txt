Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh wait, sigma is a vector of Pauli spin matrices, right? And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some arbitrary direction. Epsilon is an energy constant. 

I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each a 2x2 matrix. So when you take the dot product of sigma with n, you're kind of projecting sigma onto the direction of n. So, the operator would be something like sigma·n = n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z. 

Now, to find the eigenvalues of H, which is epsilon multiplied by this sigma·n. Oh, right, because H is a 2x2 matrix, it should have two eigenvalues. 

Wait, what's the general approach for finding eigenvalues? You set the determinant of (H - λI) to zero, right? So solving det(H - λI) = 0.

But wait, I think there's a smarter way since sigma·n is a spin operator. Spin operators in the direction of n, for spin-½ particles, have eigenvalues plus and minus half of Planck's constant over 2π, but wait, wait, Planck's constant comes into play here because Pauli matrices are related to spin.

Oh wait, actually, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2. Because the spin angular momentum is (ħ/2) sigma. 

Wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of those has eigenvalues plus and minus 1. So if I have sigma · n, which is a linear combination of these matrices, what's its eigenvalue?

Wait, the trace of sigma·n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero (since their diagonal elements are 0 and 0 for sigma_x and sigma_y, and 1 and -1 for sigma_z, but when multiplied by n_z, the diagonal would be n_z*(1) and n_z*(-1), so sum is zero. So the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of sigma·n would be... Hmm. Since sigma is a
