Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says that a solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, let's break that down. The aromatic region has two singlets at 6.7 ppm. So each of these is from an aromatic ring with equivalent protons. Since the ratio is 1:1, each compound must contribute one singlet each. That suggests each compound has a set of equivalent aromatic protons, and they are in a 1:1 ratio because each contributes equally.

The other signals are at 2.2 ppm, which is more downfield than typical aliphatic protons, maybe for CH2 or CH3 groups attached to something deshielding, like an aromatic ring. The three signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the integration is 2, 1, and 1 for each of the three peaks. That suggests there are three different types of aliphatic protons in the mixture, each present in the 2:1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each peak must come from one of the two compounds.

Wait, but wait. The aliphatic region is showing peaks in 2:1:1 ratio. Since the two compounds are present in a 1:1 ratio, each aliphatic signal must come from one of the two compounds. Let's think about the possibilities.

Looking at the options, the compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. So, what's the structure of each?

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. That would be a benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So it's like para positions but maybe a more substituted ring. Wait, no, 1,2,3,4 would be adjacent positions, making a sort of naphthalene-like structure, but no, it's a para arrangement? Wait, no, 1,2,3,4 would actually be adjacent, like four methyl groups in a row on the ring. Hmm, but that's impossible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Wait, no, maybe it's positions 1,2,3,4 as in positions 1 (para to 4), but no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's like a 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl structure, which would mean the ring has methyl groups on four consecutive positions. So, a benzene ring with four methyl groups adjacent: positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, but that's a bit crowded, right? So, but let's think about the NMR.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. So positions 1,2,4,5. So the methyl groups are on adjacent positions but with a
