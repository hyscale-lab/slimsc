Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different capabilities in terms of the brightness of the stars they can observe. The question gives me some specific info about each star, and I need to figure out which ones are bright enough for both instruments.

First, let me recall what I know. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 16. So a star that's brighter than 16 can be seen by both. Wait, noâ€”wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 mag" for HIRES. Oh, so ESPRESSO can handle stars up to 17 magnitude and below, meaning it can see fainter stars than HIRES, which can only go up to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have a V magnitude less than or equal to 16, right? Because HIRES can't go beyond 16. But wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17, that means magnitude less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, Mv <17,
