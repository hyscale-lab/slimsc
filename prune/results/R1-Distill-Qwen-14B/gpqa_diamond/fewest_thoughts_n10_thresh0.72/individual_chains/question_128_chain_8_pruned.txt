Alright, so I've just started my new job at this structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I need to figure out which plasmid is the correct one to use. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

Wait, the question is about which plasmid contains the correct sequence for the Human P53 protein. I remember that plasmids used for protein expression in E. coli typically contain the coding sequence (CDS) of the gene with appropriate promoters and tags. But in this case, I'm given four DNA sequences as options. I need to look for the correct coding sequence.

So, the amino acid sequence starts with Met Glu Glu Pro Gln... which is MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLM... So the first part of the protein is Met (start codon), followed by Glu, Glu, Pro, etc.

Looking at the plasmid sequences, each starts with ATG, which is the start codon (Met). The next nucleotides should code for the given amino acids.

Let's take a closer look. Each option has a long sequence, but perhaps I can compare the start sequences.

In the amino acid sequence, the first few residues after Met are Glu, Glu, Pro, Gln, etc. So the DNA should start with ATG followed by the codons for Glu, Glu, Pro, Gln, etc.

Looking at the DNA sequences:

All options start with ATGGAGGAGCC... Let's see. The ATG is the start codon, so the next codons are GAG, GAG, GCC, etc.

Translating those:

GAG is Glu, GAG is Glu, GCC is Ala? Wait, that's a problem. Because the amino acids should be Glu, Glu, Pro, Gln, etc.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. The first part of the amino acid sequence is MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLM...

So the first few amino acids after Met are E, E, P, S, D, P, S, V, etc.

Wait, maybe looking at the DNA sequences, the first few codons should code for these.

In DNA, each codon is three nucleotides, and mRNA is complementary to DNA, except T is U. So the DNA sequence is the coding strand, same as mRNA except Tâ†’U.

Let me take the DNA from the options and see:

Option A starts with ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG C C T ... Let's translate this.

ATG is Met.

Then GAG is Glu.

Next GAG is another Glu.

Then CCG is Pro.

CAG is Gln.

So the first few amino acids would be Met-Glu-Glu-Pro-Gln... which matches the given sequence. Because the given sequence is MEEPQSDPS..., right?

Wait, let me write the first few codons.
