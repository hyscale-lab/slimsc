Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The given masses are Pi(+) with 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each with two numbers representing the KE of the products.

Wait, right. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal and opposite to conserve momentum. But wait, neutrinos are super light, right? So maybe we can approximate the neutrino's mass as negligible compared to the muon's. But I'm not sure; maybe I should treat it more accurately.

So, let's model this. Let's denote the muon as m and the neutrino as n. The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So p_mu = -p_nu.

The total energy must be conserved as well. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion since it's at rest. So E_initial = m_pi cÂ².

After decay, the muon and neutrino have their energies. The muon's energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is almost zero. Wait, but in reality
