Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have already been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Their orbits are circular, so that's good because it simplifies things a bit.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But wait, both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Oh right, evolved stars can expand, but here they're the same size. So, same radius but different masses. That probably affects other factors like surface gravity, but maybe not the transit probability directly.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star from our point of view is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But how do we calculate the probability when we don't know the orientation? I think the probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can approximate it as (R_star) / a. So the probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another thought: the transit probability (p) is also sometimes approximated as the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, multiplied by something else? Or maybe it's (2R_*) / a, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_*) / (a), but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is roughly (R_*/a) multiplied by (some factor). Or wait, no, I think it
