Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it again.

The question says that we have an atom, probably from a beta decay, that's been monitored. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So the decay probability is given as 32% in 100 minutes. But after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed. How does this affect the remaining time?

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The key concept here is that the decay process is memoryless. That is, the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh right, that's the exponential decay model.

So the usual formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. The probability of decay by time t is 1 - N(t)/N0, which is 1 - e^(-λt).

In the problem, it says the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me solve for λ.

Let me rearrange that: e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Calculating ln(0.68): ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693. 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is around -0.4. Let me calculate it more accurately. Hmm, ln(0.68) = approximately -0.4 (since e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, which is close to 0.68). So λ ≈ 0.4 / 100 = 0.004 per minute.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me use a calculator in my mind
