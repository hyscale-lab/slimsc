Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, the problem says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? The options are A to D, with some percentages.

Hmm. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The key idea here is that each atom has a certain probability of decaying in a given time, and the process is memoryless. Oh wait, memoryless means that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed, right? So even if the atom has been around for 50 minutes, the chance from now on is the same as it was from the beginning.

Wait, but wait. The given probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that might be the total up to 100 minutes. But if 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet, what does that mean for the remaining time?

I think we should model this using the decay equation. The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The probability of decaying by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

But wait, the problem gives a 32% chance within 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me solve for λ.

Let me rearrange that equation: e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -λ*100 = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68), I think ln(1) is 0, and ln(0.5) is about -0.693. So 0.68 is a bit higher than 0.5. Let me estimate: ln(
