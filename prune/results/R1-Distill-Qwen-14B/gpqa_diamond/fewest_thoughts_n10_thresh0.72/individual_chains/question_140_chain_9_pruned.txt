Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is almost the freezing point of water, which is 273 K. Oh wait, but 277 is a bit higher, maybe like 5 degrees Celsius?

Next, the product when a certain keto acid reacts with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Hmm, and the question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.

So, I need to figure out what X is, then identify its constituent elements. Then calculate the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses, including all isotopes.

Let me break it down:

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violently reacting, likely an acid-base reaction or maybe a redox reaction. Y is a liquid, so maybe water or something like that. Gas W: same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecule would have equal p and n, so like something like O2? No, O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons would make 16O, so O2 would have each O with 8 p and 8 n. Or maybe H2O? Wait, no, for each H2O molecule, the p and n counts are different. Alternatively, maybe CO2, but that's a triatomic molecule. Wait, the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, wait, the molecule's entire molecule. So each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Oh, no, per molecule, the total protons and neutrons in the molecule are the same. So for example, if it's H2O, each molecule has (2*1 + 8) protons (10) and (2*0 + 8) neutrons (8?), wait no, that's for each H and O. No, wait, each water molecule has 2 H and 1 O. So H has 1 proton, O has 8. So total protons in molecule: 2*1 + 8 =10. Total neutrons: H has 0, O has 8 (if it's 16O). So 8 neutrons. So 10 protons vs 8 neutrons: not equal. So not H2O.

Another option: CO2. Each molecule has C (6 p, 6 n if it's 12C?), and 2 O (8 p, 8 n if 16O). So total protons:6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons:6 + 2*8=22. Oh wait, that would make it equal. So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in each molecule. So that's an option for W.

Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule. Another option is O2: each
