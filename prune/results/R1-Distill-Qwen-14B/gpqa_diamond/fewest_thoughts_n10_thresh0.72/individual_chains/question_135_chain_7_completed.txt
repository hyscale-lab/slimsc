Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I remember from my studies that bosons can decay into fermions, and the allowed decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the fermions involved.

The problem says the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant for determining the decay modes. Wait, the Lagrangian term is L = -λ_f fψ̄ f (y)(upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo or something because the formatting is a bit off. But I think it's the interaction term between X and the fermions. So, the X field is interacting with various fermions.

But the main point is about the allowed decays. So for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than the mass of the boson. Since X is 6 GeV, any fermion pair where 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV is allowed.

Let's list the fermion masses. The known fermion masses are:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.004 GeV (or maybe a bit higher, but usually considered light)
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so X can't decay into t tbar because 2*173 is way bigger than 6 GeV.

So for each fermion pair, check if 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

Let's see:

- For b quark (mass ~4.5 GeV), 2m_b is about 9 GeV. That's larger than 6 GeV, so X cannot decay into b bbar.

Wait, wait, the bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5 is 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, so that's not allowed. So decay into b bbar is kinematically forbidden.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A and D include b bbar, which would be incorrect.

So let's check other fermions.

- tau: 2m_tau is ~3.554 GeV (since 1.777 * 2). That's less than 6 GeV. So X → τ+ τ- is allowed.

- mu: 2m_mu is ~0.21 GeV. Allowed.

- e: 2m_e is negligible, so allowed.

- c quark: mass ~1.5 GeV, so 2m_c=3 GeV <6 GeV. So c cbar is allowed.

- s quark: 2m_s is ~0.19 GeV (since s is ~0.095 GeV). Allowed.

- u and d quarks: their masses are very small, so 2m_u and 2m_d are way below 6 GeV. So u ubar and d dbar are allowed.

So the allowed fermion pairs are:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but what about neutrinos? Oh, the Lagrangian term involves ψ_f, which are probably charged leptons (like e, mu, tau) and quarks. Because in the Standard Model, neutrinos are neutral and the interaction terms usually involve charged leptons. So X can decay into pairs of charged leptons and quarks, but not neutrinos because they are neutral and the interaction term is probably with charged fermions.

So looking at the options:

Option A: includes b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. But since b is too heavy, this option is incorrect.

Option B: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. That's all the allowed except for b and t. So it looks correct.

Option C: includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. But t is too heavy, so this is incorrect.

Option D: includes b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Again, b is too heavy, so incorrect.

Wait, but let me double-check. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2m is 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar. So any option including b is incorrect.

So the correct decay modes are c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. So looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, but option B says c cbar, same as the correct. So the allowed are:

c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So, in the options:

Option B includes all these. So that's the correct answer.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to the boson's mass (\( 2m_f \leq m_X \)).

The fermion masses are approximately:

- \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_u \approx 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_d \approx 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

Checking each fermion pair:

- \( b\bar{b} \): \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), so this decay is forbidden.
- \( c\bar{c} \): \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( s\bar{s} \): \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( u\bar{u} \): \( 2m_u = 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( d\bar{d} \): \( 2m_d = 0.008 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( \tau^+\tau^- \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( \mu^+\mu^- \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.
- \( e^+e^- \): \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Matches the allowed decays. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
