Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think it through step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. So wait, the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. When it splits, the two fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99 M. So that means some mass was converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in fission, energy is released.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. They're asking for the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the T1 calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

So I need to find T1 correctly, then find what it would be using classical methods, and subtract the two.

First, let's outline the given data:

- Initial rest mass: M. Its rest energy is 300 GeV.

- After fission, two fragments: let's call them m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 * m2.

- Sum of rest masses: m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, but the initial sum is M. So 99% of that is 0.99 M. So the total rest mass after fission is 0.99 M. That means the mass defect, Δm = M - (m1 + m2) = M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. So the mass converted into energy is 1% of M.

But wait, the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. So the rest mass energy of the initial nucleus is M c² = 300 GeV. So M is 300 GeV/c².

Hmm, okay. So the energy released in the fission would be the sum of the kinetic energies of the two fragments plus any other forms of energy, but since the question is about the kinetic energy, I think we can model this as the kinetic
