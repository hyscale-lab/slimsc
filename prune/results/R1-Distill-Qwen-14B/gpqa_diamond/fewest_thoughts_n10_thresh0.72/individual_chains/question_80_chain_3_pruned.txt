Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out what the algorithm does based on the given examples, and then apply it to a new input. Let me try to break it down.

The first example is AGG -> 115. The second is TGCTGA -> 176. And the question is about what ACAGTGACC gives. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think step by step. So, I need to figure out what transformation is being applied to the DNA sequences to get these numbers.

Let me start by looking at the first example: AGG. Breaking it down, each letter is a nucleotide. A, G, G. So maybe each nucleotide is being converted into a number in some way.

Wait, I remember that sometimes DNA sequences are converted using their positions in the alphabet. Let's see: A is the first letter, so 1. G is the 7th, so 7. So AGG would be 1,7,7. But how does that add up to 115?

Wait, another approach: maybe each nucleotide is converted to its position, and then summed. So for AGG: 1 +7 +7 =15. But the output is 115, which is way larger. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is being converted to its position, and then multiplied. Let's see: 1 *7 *7 =49. Doesn't match 115. So that's not it.

Alternative idea: perhaps each nucleotide is converted to a binary or some other base? Let me think. I know that in some systems, A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3, but I'm not sure. Let me test that. AGG would be 0,3,3. Maybe that's added: 0+3+3=6. Not 115. Hmm.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is converted into a number and then concatenated. Like A=1, G=7. So AGG would be 1,7,7. Concatenated as 177, but the output is 115. Hmm,
