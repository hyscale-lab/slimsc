Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, I need to figure out which transition path and probability is correct. Let me start by recalling what I know about atomic transitions.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ through two dipole transitions. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different intermediate state and a probability.

Wait, so in hydrogen, electrons transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. I remember that for dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but wait, no, wait. Oh right, wait the main selection rules for hydrogen are: Δl = ±1 (so the angular momentum changes by 1), and Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number is 0 or ±1). But for the principal quantum number n, the transition can be by any change as long as the other rules are satisfied, but in practice, for dipole transitions, the change in n is usually ±1 or ±2, but I'm not certain about that. Or is it that n must change by at least 1? No, wait, no, the selection rules for n in hydrogen are not as strict as for other atoms because the orbital angular momentum plays a bigger role. So the main rules are for l and m.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So the initial n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It decays to |1,0,0⟩, so l=0 again. Since l must change by ±1 in each transition, but here both initial and final are l=0. So the decay must happen in two steps. Because each transition can only change l by ±1, so if you go from l=0 to l=1 in the first transition, then from l=1 to l=0 in the second.

Wait, because a single transition from l=0 to l=0 is not allowed, since Δl would be 0, which is not ±1. So the decay must involve two transitions: 3,0,0 → some state with l=1, then from there to 1,0,0.

So the intermediate state must have l=1. So the possible intermediates are |2,1,m⟩ or |4,
