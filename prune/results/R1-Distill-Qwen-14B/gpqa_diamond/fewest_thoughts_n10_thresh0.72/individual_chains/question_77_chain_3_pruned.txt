Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. From what I studied, the Cope rearrangement typically involves 1,5-dienes. When heated or exposed to light, the molecule rearranges, moving the double bonds. The problem gives two reactions, and I need to figure out the major products A and B.

Alright, let's look at the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw the structure. The benzene ring has a substituent: an OCH2 group attached to the benzene. The O is connected to CH2, which is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-enyl group. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-enyl would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-2-enyl has the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)- something? Wait, no, but-2-enyl is CH2-CH2 double bond, so but-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. Wait, but the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the substituent is at position 1, so the group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So the structure is OCH2CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to benzene. Wait, no. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl, which is OCH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to benzene. Or perhaps I should think of it as benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent. But with a 3-methyl, so the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2-? Hmm, maybe I should re-examine that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is correctly drawn as benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but but-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, so but-2-en-1-yl would be the same. So adding a methyl group on the third carbon. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is OCH2CH2C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the benzene.

Wait, that makes the substituent on the
