Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. Right, when they undergo this rearrangement, they form a different structure, usually with a new position of double bonds. The reaction is typically initiated by heat or light. 

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's break them down.

First part: Starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, and it's treated with BuLi followed by H+. I'm trying to figure out what this structure looks like. The benzene ring has a substituent which is an oxy group connected to a methyl group, and then another part. Wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is -CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but wait, maybe I should draw it.

So the substituent is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- or wait, no. Let's see: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a methyl on the third carbon? Wait, but but is four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but then 3-methyl would be on the third carbon? So it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the group is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon, but that's the end. So maybe it's O-CH2-C(=CH2)CH(CH3)? No, maybe it's O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- but that can't be because that's four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as: the
