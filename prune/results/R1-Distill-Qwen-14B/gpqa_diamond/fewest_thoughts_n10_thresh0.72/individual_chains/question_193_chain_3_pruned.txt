Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let's read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. The formula I know is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx is in arcseconds. So if distance (d) increases, parallax decreases. I think the relation is d = 1/plx. So, plx is proportional to 1/d.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. So let's write that as N ∝ 1/(plx^5). But since plx is inversely proportional to d, plx = k/d, where k is some constant. So plx^5 would be (k/d)^5 = k^5/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is d^5/(k^5). So N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, so they're asking about the change in number (the derivative) with respect to r. Because distance is a continuous variable here, and we're looking at how many more stars are present as we move to a slightly larger distance.

So the number of stars as a function of distance is N(d) = C * d^5, where C is a constant. So the number of stars increases as d^5. But the question is about the rate of change of N with d. So dN/dr is the derivative of N with respect to r (assuming r is the same as d, distance).

Calculating the derivative: dN/dr = d(C d^5)/dd = 5 C d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. Wait, but the options given are about how the number changes with distance, per unit range, so perhaps they're referring to the density or the rate of change being proportional to r^4.

Wait, but let me think again
