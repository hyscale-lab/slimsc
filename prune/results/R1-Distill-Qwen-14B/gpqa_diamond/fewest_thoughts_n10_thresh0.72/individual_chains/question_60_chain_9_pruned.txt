Okay, I need to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

So, there's a civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they have a spacecraft traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. Oh right, it's from the astronaut's point of view, so we're dealing with their proper time.

Wait, the question says the average lifetime is about 150 solar years. But the astronaut is 22, so if the trip takes more than about 128 years (150 -22), he might not survive. So the options are either he dies (A) or one of the other options.

But wait, the other options are in the 70s to 80s. So maybe the trip time is within 80 years, so he would live.

But wait, time dilation comes into play here. Since the spacecraft is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) will be less than the time measured in Earth's frame. Or wait, wait. Proper time is the shortest time. So from Earth's perspective, the trip would take a certain amount of time, but from the astronaut's perspective, it's shorter.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The proper time is the time measured by the clock moving with the event. So in this case, the astronaut's clock is the proper time. So if we calculate the Earth's frame time, then the astronaut's time would be less.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the distance to Earth as observed from Earth and then calculate the time from the astronaut's frame using time dilation.

Wait, the problem is probably involving length contraction. Because from the astronaut's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted. Oh, because they're moving at a high speed, so the distance is shorter.

So first, I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, but the problem doesn't give that. Oh wait, maybe I was supposed to know that the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. I think that's correct.

Wait, but if the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, then from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is contracted. Let me calculate the contracted distance.

The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame, so 160,000 ly), and L is the contracted length in the astronaut's frame.

Wait, but v is 0.99999987c. Let me compute beta = v/c = 0.99999987.

So beta is approximately 0.99999987. So beta squared is close to 1, but let me compute it accurately. Let's compute 1 - beta^2.

Beta^2 = (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that.

0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013. So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. The last term is negligible, so approximately 1 - 2.6e-7.

So 1 - beta^2 ≈ 2.6e-7.

Then sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.1e-4.

So L = L0 * 5.1e-4. L0 is 160,000 ly.

So L = 160,000 * 5.1e-4 = 160,000 * 0.00051 = let's compute that.

160,000 * 0.0005 is 80, and 160,000 * 0.00001 is 1.6. So 80 + (1.6 * 0.5) = Wait, wait, 0.00051 is 0.0005 + 0.00001. So 160,000 * 0.0005 = 80, and 160,000 * 0.00001 = 1.6. So 80 + 1.6 = 81.6 light-years.

Wait, wait, no, 160,000 * 5.1e-4 = 160,000 * 0.00051. Let me compute 160,000 * 0.0005 = 80, and 160,000 * 0.00001 = 1.6. So 0.00051 = 0.0005 + 0.00001, so 80 + 1.6 = 81.6 light-years. So L ≈ 81.6 light-years.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the time from the astronaut's perspective t = L / v. V is 0.99999987c, which is about 1 c. So t ≈ 81.6 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 81.6 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 81.6 * 1.00000013 ≈ about 81.6 + 0.1 ≈ 81.7 years.

Wait, but that's from the astronaut's frame. Because in their frame, the distance is shorter, so the time is shorter.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the time dilation formula. Let me think.

In Earth's frame, the distance is 160,000 light-years,
