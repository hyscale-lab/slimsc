Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along a certain direction, right? The direction is an arbitrary vector n lying in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when measured.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the problem. The operator P is given in terms of its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I think the first step is to figure out the vector n. Since it's in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by two angles, I suppose. Wait, no, in three dimensions, any direction in the x-z plane would have components (x, 0, z). So the vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), maybe? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So, yeah, that makes sense. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

But wait, the operator P is along the direction of n. Oh right! So the operator P we're considering is the component in the direction of n. So it's like the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. Mathematically, that would be P = n · (Px, Py, Pz). So, P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Let me write down the matrices for each component. Px is ħ/2 times [[0,1],[1,0]]. Py is ħ/2 times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Pz is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So substituting these into the expression for P, we get:

P = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1
