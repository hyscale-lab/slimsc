Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. From this treatment, two different diketones are produced. I need to figure out what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds react with HCl, NaNO2, and water, they undergo specific reactions. Wait, NaNO2 and HCl are involved. Oh right! This reminds me of the HNO2 reaction, which is usually involved in diazotization or maybe something like the Stephen reduction. Wait, no, diazotization is typically with primary amines, right? Or maybe it's the formation of a nitro compound.

Wait, another possibility: maybe these conditions are for the formation of a ketone from an alcohol, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think about the Beckmann rearrangement. No, that's for oximes. Or maybe it's the formation of a nitronium ion, which could lead to some kind of substitution.

Wait, another angle: I recall that when a secondary alcohol is treated with HCl, NaNO2, and then H2O, it can form a ketone. Oh wait! That's the Stephen reduction? Or wait, no, maybe it's the formation of a nitrone intermediate leading to a ketone. Let me think. Oh wait, actually, I think the reaction is called the HNO2 (nitrous acid) reaction with alcohols. For secondary alcohols, this can lead to the formation of a ketone.

Wait, right! The reaction of secondary alcohols with nitrous acid (HONO) can lead to the formation of a ketone via the mechanism where the alcohol is converted into an N-nitrosamine intermediate, which then undergoes elimination to form the ketone. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's about the Hofmann elimination or something else.

Wait, let me get this straight. The treatment here is HCl, NaNO2, and water. So, HCl would provide the acidic conditions, and NaNO2 would supply the nitrous acid (HONO) when H+ is present. So, the reaction is likely the conversion of a secondary alcohol into a ketone.

Wait, but I thought that nitrous acid typically reacts with primary alcohols to form N-nitroso compounds, but secondary alcohols might not react the same way. Or wait, maybe for cyclic alcohols, like cyclohexanol derivatives, nitrous acid can cause some cyclization or ring expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Beckmann rearrangement, but that's for oximes. So, if a compound has an oxime group, treating it with acid and water could lead to rearrangement into a ketone. But the question doesn't mention oximes, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are aldehydes or ketones, and the treatment leads to something else. No, that doesn't make sense because the products are diketones, so the starting materials must have been something that
