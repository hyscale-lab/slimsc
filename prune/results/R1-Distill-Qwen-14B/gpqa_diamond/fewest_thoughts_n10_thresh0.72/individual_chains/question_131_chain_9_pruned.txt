Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The key difference is in their NOESY NMR spectra: the major product has a cross-peak, and the minor doesn't or has a very weak one. I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

First, I'll break down the information given.

1. The dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. Since it's a cis-alkene originally, the dehydration probably forms a cyclic anhydride, possibly a five-membered ring because that's more stable. Wait, but wait—the anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Hmm. Let me think about the structure of the anhydride. A cyclic anhydride would have an oxygen connecting two carbonyl groups. The 13C NMR shows two peaks in the carbonyl region. Wait, 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon. What about 137 ppm? That's probably an sp2 hybridized carbon, maybe part of the ring.

Wait, the 1H NMR has only one peak at 7 ppm. That's a bit tricky. For a cyclic anhydride like maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond would be deshielded and appear around 6-7 ppm. But if the anhydride doesn’t have any protons, like if it's a symmetric structure, maybe that's why there's only one peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bridged structure where all equivalent protons are present.

Wait, if the original acid is a cis-dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene, when dehydrated, the anhydride would have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected via an oxygen. So, maybe it's a five-membered ring. Let me think: when you dehydrate a cis-dicarboxylic acid with a double bond, you form an anhydride. For instance, if it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, maybe HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH is saturated, but in this case, it's cis-alkene, so perhaps HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H with a double bond? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene—so perhaps something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond? No, wait, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe a structure like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH wouldn’t have a double bond. Wait, no, the question says the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene, meaning the acid has a double bond in the chain. So maybe it's like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in between, making the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, that’s not right. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but the CH2 groups have a double bond in between. Oh wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-C
