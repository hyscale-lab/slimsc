Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's think step by step.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which means no acceleration involved, so maybe I can use classical mechanics here? Wait, but the speed mentioned is 60,000 km/s. Oh wait, that's really fast—like a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh right, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is 20% of that. So relativistic effects might come into play, but wait the question is about distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So, the problem is about time dilation and length contraction perhaps. Because each frame has their own measurements of time and space. Let me recall the principles.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at the same speed—60,000 km/s. So the speeds are equal but opposite depending on the frame.

We need to find how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, but time is given in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. I think I need to relate that time to the Galaxy's frame to find the distance.

Wait, no, because in the Galaxy's frame, the time experienced by the ejecta might be different due to time dilation. Because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is moving, so it would tick slower. Or is it the other way around?

Let me clarify: The time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. So, in the ejecta's frame, they experience 50 seconds passing. But in the Galaxy's frame, this time would be longer because of time dilation. Because the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy.

Wait, the formula for time dilation is t' = gamma * t, where t is the time measured in the stationary frame (Galaxy's frame), and t' is the moving frame
