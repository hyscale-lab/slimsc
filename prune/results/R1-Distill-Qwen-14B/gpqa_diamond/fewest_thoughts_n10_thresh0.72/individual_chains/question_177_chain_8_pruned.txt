Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

Alright, the problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, their masses are the same ratio—M1 is 1.5 times M2. But wait, the problem isn't directly about mass, it's about luminosity. Oh, but maybe mass isn't directly relevant here unless it affects something else like temperature or radius.

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength of their black body radiation. Wait, I remember Wien's Law. Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. If the λ_max are the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's important.

So, both stars have the same temperature. Now, what's the formula for luminosity of a star? Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars are black bodies, this should apply.

So L1 and L2 would be proportional to R squared times T^4. Since T is the same for both, T1 = T2 = T, so T^4 is a common factor. So the ratio of L1 to L2 is (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (R1² / R2²) * (1) because T's are same.

But wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Plugging that into the ratio: ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / R2^2 = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2
