Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's break it down.

The question says both planets have the same mass, so that part doesn't matter. They both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because it orbits faster. 

Wait, orbital period is related to the distance from the star via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³, but since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars, M+m ≈ M. So for a star of mass M, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed, which for a circular orbit is the same as the distance a. So, if P₁ = P₂ / 3, then (P₁)² = (P₂/3)² = (P₂²)/9. So, since P² ∝ a³, then a₁³ / a₂³ = (P₁²)/(P₂²) = (1/9). Taking cube roots, a₁/a₂ = (1/9)^(1/3) ≈ 1/2.08, so a₁ ≈ a₂ / 2.08. So Planet_1 is about 2.08 times closer to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If Planet_1's period is shorter, that would mean it's closer. So if P1 is P2 /3, then a1 is a2 multiplied by (P1² / P2²)^(1/3). Wait, yes, because Kepler's law: a³ = (G(M) * P²)/(4π²). So [a1/a2]³ = [P1² / P2²] * [M2 / M1], wait, because each star has a different mass. Oh right, the host star of Planet_1 has mass twice that of Planet_2's host. So M1 =
