Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain branch of reactions in the Sun's core suddenly stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is about the ratio of the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, so any changes in the Sun's core would take that long to be observed here.

So, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? The proton-proton chain is the main process in the Sun's core for converting hydrogen into helium. I remember that there are a couple of branches in the pp chain. The pp-I branch produces a deuterium nucleus (D) and emits a positron and a neutrino. Then, the pp-II branch involves a D capturing a proton to form helium-3 (He-3), which then can either combine with another He-3 in the pp-III branch to make He-4, or one He-3 can combine with a He-2 (if I remember correctly) in a different pathway.

Wait, no, I think the other main path is where a He-3 combines with a He-3 and a He-2 (which is a boron isotope) to produce carbon. But I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify. The main proton-proton chain has two main branches: 

1. The pp-I branch: p + p → D + e⁺ + ν_e. Then D + p → He-3 + γ. He-3 can then either combine with another He-3 in the pp-III branch (He-3 + He-3 → He-4 + 2γ) or with a He-2 (from the pp-II branch, which is He-3 + He-2 → He-4 + γ).

Wait, no, the pp-II might actually be part of a different branch. Alternatively, the pp chain can be broken into steps where the first two protons form deuterium, then the deuterium captures a proton to form He-3. Now
