Okay, so I have this Cope rearrangement problem to solve. Hmm, Cope rearrangement... I remember it's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It usually involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another diene. The reaction is done under specific conditions, maybe heat or something like that. Oh wait, the Cope rearrangement typically occurs for 1,5-dienes, and it forms another 1,5-diene but in a different structure.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it's a norbornene derivative. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, with the 2-position having a vinyl group. So, the molecule has a bridge, and the double bond is at position 5.

Wait, so the structure is norbornene with a bridge between carbons 1 and 4. The 2-vinyl group is attached to the bridgehead, carbon 2. And the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6, perhaps? Or maybe 5 and 5a? I'm a bit confused about the numbering here.

Let me draw this out. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has rings of 2, 2, and 1. So, it's a norbornene structure. The numbering: 1 is one bridgehead, 2 is adjacent to it, then 3, 4 is the other bridgehead, and so on.

The substituents are a vinyl group (CHâ‚‚=CH-) attached to carbon 2. So, the molecule is 2-vinyl-substituted norbornene.

Wait, but wait, how does the Cope rearrangement apply here? Because for Cope, we need a 1
