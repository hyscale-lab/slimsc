Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds, and each is referred to as A1, A2, A3, A4, A5.

First, I'll try to identify what element Y could be. Since the compounds are binary with fluorine, Y is likely a halogen, maybe something like chlorine or another element that forms multiple fluorides. Wait, the problem mentions that A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So, maybe A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one plus F2?

The fact that A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 can oxidize it, A1 must be a strong oxidizing fluoride. The common strong oxidizing fluorides are things like ClF3 or something similar. Wait, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. But let me think. Another possibility is FClO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's ClF3.

Wait, let me think about the decomposition. A1 decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. Suppose A1 is ClF3. When ClF3 decomposes, what happens? I think ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2. Let me check that. The decomposition reaction: 4 ClF3 â†’ ClF + 3 F2. Oh, wait, but if that's the case, then the yield of F2 would be more. Wait, the problem says that the oF (I think that stands for oxidation state of F?) in A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, maybe that's the percentage of fluorine by mass.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fluorine content in A2. Let's say the molecular formula of A2 is YF_x. The percentage of fluorine would be (atomic weight of F * x) / (atomic weight of Y + x*F) * 100 = 31.96%. Let's calculate that.

Fluorine's atomic weight is about 19. So, if Y is Cl (atomic weight ~35.
