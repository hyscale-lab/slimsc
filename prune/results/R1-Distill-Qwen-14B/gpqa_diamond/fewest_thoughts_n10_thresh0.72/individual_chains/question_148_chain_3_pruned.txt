Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances are labeled A1 to A5. I need to find where the molecular weight of A4 falls among the given options.

Hmm, starting with A1. It's a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So, the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized usually implies it's acting as a reducing agent. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent.

A2 has an ɷF of 31.96%. ɷF is the mole fraction of fluorine in the compound. So let's calculate the molecular formula for A2. If ɷF is 31.96%, that's about 0.3196. Let's assume A2 is a binary compound, so the formula is YF_x. The mole fraction of F is x/(x+1) = 0.3196. Let me solve for x.

x/(x+1) = 0.3196
Multiply both sides by (x+1): x = 0.3196(x + 1)
x = 0.3196x + 0.3196
x - 0.3196x = 0.3196
0.6804x = 0.3196
x = 0.3196 / 0.6804 ≈ 0.47

Wait, that can't be right because x should be an integer. Maybe I did something wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is YF3. Let me check: YF3 has 3 F atoms. Mole fraction F is 3/(1+3) = 3/4 = 0.75. That's 75%, which is higher than 31.96%. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe A2 is YF. Then mole fraction F would be 1/2 = 0.5, which is 50%. Still not matching 31.96%. Wait another approach: maybe it's not YF_x, but perhaps a polyatomic structure, but the question says binary compounds, so Y and F only. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is off. Let me compute it more accurately.

x/(x+1) = 0.3196
x = 0.3196(x +1)
x = 0.3196x + 0.3196
x - 0.3196x = 0.3196
0.6804x = 0.3196
x = 0.3196 / 0.6804 ≈ 0.47.

Wait, that's approximately 0.47, which isn't an integer. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe 31.96% is close to 1/3.333 (which is 30%). So 30% is approximately 1/3.333, which suggests x=3. So for YF3, F mole fraction is 3/(3+1)= 3/4=75%. No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe YF5? No, that would be 5/6 ≈83%. Hmm. Maybe I should think of 31.96% as approximately 32%, which is close to 1/3.125, which would suggest x=3.125. But that's a fraction, which doesn't make sense for
