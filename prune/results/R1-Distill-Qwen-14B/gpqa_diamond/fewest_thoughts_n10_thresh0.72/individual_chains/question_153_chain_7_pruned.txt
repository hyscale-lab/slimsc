Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reactions, and I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So, the reaction adds a nucleophile to the beta carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. 

There are three parts to the problem: A, B, and C. I need to figure out the reactants and the major products for each, then match them with the given options.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as the conditions. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile for the Michael reaction. It's a diethyl malonate derivative but with methyl groups. It's a good donor because it can form an enolate. So in the presence of a base like NaOEt, which is sodium ethoxide, the base deprotonates the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate. 

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCOOEt, but wait, the substituent here is p-tolyl (a methyl group attached to a phenyl ring) at the 3-position. So the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOEt? No, wait, wait. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it out mentally. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon? Hmm. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2COOEt? Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-R. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon of the acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOEt. Wait, no, that can't be because the numbering might be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(=O)-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the acrylate part. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the acrylate is substituted with a p-tolyl group at the beta position, making the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, structure is something like Ph-C(CH2COOEt)=CH2? No, maybe it's (E)-CH2-CH(C6H4Me)-COOEt? Wait, perhaps it's more like the ac
