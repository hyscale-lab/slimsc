Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem describes an electron state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that spin states are often represented as two-level systems, like spin-up and spin-down, which form a basis for the Hilbert space. The state |alpha> is given, but it's proportional, so I'll probably need to normalize it.

The question has two main parts: first, finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and second, calculating the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation A has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, no, the operator's matrix is A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 when i=j? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says Aij = hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Oh, so the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So the matrix would look like this:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. Oh, because the eigenstates are |up> and |down>, which are two in number, so the operator acts on a two-dimensional space. So the operator is represented as a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. The matrix is such that A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, else zero. So for a two-dimensional matrix, that would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, because when i= j, it's zero, so the diagonal is zero. Off-diagonal are ħ/2. So that's the matrix form.

But wait,
