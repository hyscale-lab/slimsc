Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what it says. So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and it has a small cavity inside. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center, and the cavity radius is r, which is less than R. 

Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. I remember that in electrostatics, especially with conductors, the charges redistribute in certain ways. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, I think the charges inside would induce some charges on the conductor's surfaces.

Wait, the conductor is a sphere, so maybe the charges on its inner and outer surfaces are important. Oh right, when a charge is inside a cavity, it induces equal and opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor, and the outer surface would then have a charge equal to the net charge on the conductor. But since the conductor was uncharged, the total charge is zero. So the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Oh no, wait. The conductor is neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have -q induced on it. Then, because the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance. Hmm, that makes sense. So the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the inner surface would be a spherical shell with radius R, but the cavity is not at the center because s is the separation between the centers. Oh, right, the cavity is shifted. So the setup is not symmetric. Hmmm. That complicates things because the induced charges might not be uniformly distributed.

In a symmetric case, where the cavity is at the center, the electric field outside the conductor would be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But here, the cavity is off-center
