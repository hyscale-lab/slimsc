Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product E. Hmm, let's go through each step carefully.

First, the starting material is propionaldehyde. Its structure is CH3CH2CHO. When it reacts with EDT (which I think is ethanolic KOH) and BF3, maybe it's an aldol condensation? Or perhaps it's a different type of reaction. Wait, BF3 is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or in some aldehyde reactions. Oh wait, propionaldehyde reacting with EDT and BF3... Maybe it's forming an enolate? So A would be an enolate of propionaldehyde. But wait, propionaldehyde is an aldehyde, so the enolate would be at the alpha position. So the enolate would have a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Next, compound A reacts with BuLi. BuLi is a strong base, so it would deprotonate compounds. But if A is already an enolate (like from the previous step), maybe this adds more... Wait, perhaps the first reaction forms an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, maybe the first step is a Claisen condensation. Wait, no, propionaldehyde would undergo aldol addition more likely. So maybe A is an aldol adduct. Wait, no, because for aldol, you usually need a base. EDT is KOH, so maybe the first step is an aldol reaction.

Wait, propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) can undergo aldol condensation under basic conditions. Since it's an aldehyde, the enolate would form, attack another molecule... So perhaps A is the aldol product. The aldol product of two propionaldehydes would be CH2CH2C(O)CH2CHO. Wait, no, let me think. Wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The aldol addition would form a beta-hydroxy aldehyde. So two molecules of propionaldehyde would form CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2CHO? Or perhaps it's a dimer. Wait, actually, the aldol addition between two aldehyde molecules would form a molecule with a CH(OH)CH2 group. So maybe the structure of A is CH3CH2C(OH)CH2CHO? Then, when heated, it would lose water to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. So A might be the aldol adduct, but perhaps the first step is just the enolate formation, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so because BF3 is present. Wait, BF3 is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. But propionaldehyde doesn't have an aromatic ring. Hmm. Wait, another possibility: the first reaction is an enol ether formation. Using EDT and BF3, perhaps propionaldehyde undergoes some kind of acetal formation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the first step is the formation of an enol. Propionaldehyde (RCHO) reacting with a base like KOH would form the enolate. So A would be the enolate, which is a strong base. Then, when A reacts with BuLi, which is even stronger, maybe it abstracts another proton, making a more substituted enolate. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is an acid-catalyzed reaction. BF3 is a catalyst. Maybe it's for a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, BF3 could be used in some kind of alkylation, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the first step is a Baylis-Hillman reaction, but that usually involves different reagents. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a propargyl alcohol, but that doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a propargylation. No, I think I'm getting stuck. Let's think about each step one by one.

Step 1: Propionaldehyde + EDT (which is KOH) and BF3. Maybe it's a base-induced reaction. Propionaldehyde has alpha hydrogens. So the enolate would form. The structure would be CH2-CH2-CHO, but wait, wait. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The alpha carbons are the CH2 group next to the aldehyde. So the enolate would be CH2-CH(-O-)CH2-O- something? Wait, no, the enolate would be CH2=C(O-)CH2-O-... No, wait, the enolate of propionaldehyde would be the deprotonated alpha carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CHCHO(-) with a negative charge, but in solution, it would be resonance stabilized. So perhaps A is the enolate.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. But that would require elimination, not just the presence of a base. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a crossed aldol with another molecule. So A would have a new carbon-carbon bond. For instance, two molecules of propionaldehyde would undergo aldol condensation to form a larger molecule. Let's think: the aldol product would be CH2=CHCH2CHO. Wait, no. Let me draw this out mentally. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The enolate would attack another aldehyde. So the aldol addition would form CH3CH2CH(OH)CHO. Then, upon dehydration, it becomes CH3CH2C=CHCHO, but that's impossible because the double bond can't be in that position due to the aldehyde. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CHO? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a Claisen-like condensation, but propionaldehyde is an aldehyde, not an ester. So maybe it's an aldol addition. Maybe the product A is the aldol adduct, which is a β-hydroxy aldehyde. So, A is CH3CH2C(OH)CH2CHO. Then, when heated, it loses water to form an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. So perhaps A is an enal. Let's say A is CH2=CHCH2CHO.

Then, step 2: A reacts with BuLi. BuLi is a strong base, so it would deprotonate the α position. The enal has a double bond, so the α position is next to the carbonyl. So deprotonating would form a conjugate base. Then, adding BuLi would add more electrons. Wait, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps the enal reacts with BuLi to form a more substituted enolate.

Wait, but butyllithium is a strong base. So adding BuLi to A (which is an enal) would abstract a proton alpha to the carbonyl, forming a conjugated base. So from the enal, which is CH2=CHCH2CHO, the alpha protons are on the CH2 next to the CHO. So BuLi would deprotonate that, creating a conjugated base. The resulting structure would have a negative charge on the adjacent carbon, perhaps leading to a more substituted double bond.

Wait, but if A is CH3CH2CH=CHCHO, wait, no, earlier I thought A was CH2=CHCH2CHO. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 produces a different product. Let me think again. Propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) reacts with KOH (EDT) and BF3. BF3 is a Lewis acid, which can help in the formation of enolates. So maybe the reaction is forming an enol ether. Oh wait, perhaps it's a propargylation, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 forms a triphenylmethyl enol ether, but that's for ketones, not aldehydes. Hmm.

I think I might be stuck on the first step. Let me try to proceed and see if the later steps clarify things.

Step 3: compound C reacts with HgCl2, H2O, and H+ to give D. HgCl2 is often used in oxymercuration, which adds water across a double bond in a Markovnikov fashion. So if C has a double bond, D would be the mercurinium ion intermediate leading to an alcohol.

Step 4: D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to give E. PPh3 is a mild reducing agent, but wait, when used with BuLi, maybe it's a radical reaction? Or perhaps it's a Staudinger reaction? Or maybe it's a conjugate reduction. Alternatively, D might have a mercury compound, and in step 4, the mercury is replaced. Wait, perhaps D has a mercuric group from oxymercuration, and step 4 replaces it with something else.

Wait, another thought: when D is treated with PPh3, it could be a Mitsunobu reaction. But that usually involves an alcohol and PPh3 with a diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) or similar. Alternatively, maybe D has a bromine somewhere, and PPh3 is used to replace it.

Wait, let's try to piece it all together. Maybe the overall process is forming a more complex molecule.

Alternative approach: perhaps each step adds functional groups or modifies the structure.

Let me try to think about each step:

1. Propionaldehyde + EDT (KOH) and BF3 → A.

This could be the formation of an enolate. The enolate would be CH2=CHCHO^- Na^+ perhaps. But then, when A is treated with BuLi, which is a stronger base, it would deprotonate further, maybe at a more substituted position.

Wait, BuLi is a strong base, but in the presence of an enolate, perhaps it abstracts another proton, leading to a more substituted enolate. So maybe A is an enolate, and B is a more substituted enolate.

Then, compound B reacts with bromoethane. Bromoethane is an alkylating agent. So, the enolate would attack the bromoethane, leading to alkylation. So, the enolate (which is a strong base) would attack the ethyl bromide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

So, for example, if B is the enolate of a ketone or aldehyde, adding bromoethane would add an ethyl group there. Then, compound C would have an ethyl group added.

Next, compound C undergoes oxymercuration (HgCl2, H2O, H+). This would add a hydroxyl group across the double bond in a Markovnikov fashion.

Then, D would be an alcohol. Finally, D is treated with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to form E. Hmm, what's that step? PPh3 is often used in the Staudinger reaction with azides, or in the Mitsunobu reaction for alcohol transformations.

Alternatively, perhaps D has a bromide, and PPh3 is used for substitution. Or perhaps the BuLi is doing a deprotonation and alkylation.

Wait, another thought: The last step might be a substitution reaction. If D has a bromide, maybe PPh3 is acting as a reducing agent for a mercury compound. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps D is an alcohol with a mercury group. No, oxymercuration replaces the Hg with OH. So D is an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps D is an allylic alcohol, and then step 4 is a conjugate addition or elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps step 4 is an elimination to form another double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the overall process is the formation of a terpene or a bicyclic compound. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let's think about each step again:

1. Propionaldehyde → enolate (A) with KOH and BF3.

2. A → more substituted enolate (B) with BuLi.

3. B reacts with bromoethane → alkylation, giving C with an ethyl group added.

4. C → D via oxymercuration, adding an OH group.

5. D → E via PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi.

Hmm, perhaps the final step is a substitution where PPh3 is a base, and BuLi is a strong base. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, another approach: think about each compound's structure.

Assuming step 1: propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) forms an enolate, A is CH2=C(O^-)CH2CHO.

Then, step 2: treatment with BuLi (a strong base) would deprotonate A further, perhaps leading to a more substituted enolate. So maybe the enolate is at the more substituted position.

Then, step 3: alkylation with bromoethane would add an ethyl group. So, the enolate (from B) would attack the ethyl bromide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

So, if B's enolate is CH2=C(-O^-)CH2-Et? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step leading to a specific structure.

Let me try to draw this out.

Propionaldehyde: CH3CH2CHO.

Step 1: form enolate. Enolates are formed by deprotonating alpha to carbonyl. So, A would be CH2=C(-O-)CH2CHO, but with the negative charge stabilized.

Step 2: BuLi is a strong base, so it would abstract another proton, perhaps at a more substituted position. Maybe the enolate becomes more substituted, creating a more stable enolate. So, perhaps the structure becomes CH2=C(-O-)CH2CHO with more substitution.

Wait, actually, propionaldehyde has only two alpha hydrogens (on the CH2 group next to the aldehyde). So the enolate would have a negative charge on the CH2. When treated with BuLi, which is even stronger, perhaps it deprotonates another alpha hydrogen, but there are no more available. Wait, maybe the initial enolate is formed at the less substituted position, and BuLi forms a more substituted one.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step forms an enolate, then BuLi adds another ethyl group via alkylation. But if the first step is enolate formation, the second step (BuLi) could be deprotonation again, leading to a more substituted enolate, which then can attack bromoethane in the next step.

So, let's say step 1: enolate formation at the CH2 next to the aldehyde (A is CH2=C(O-)CH2CHO).

Step 2: BuLi deprotonates another alpha H, but there are no others. So maybe it's adding an ethyl group. Wait, no, BuLi is a strong base, but in step 3, it's reacting with bromoethane. So perhaps step 3 is alkylation.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, the enolate abstracts a proton, but since there are none, maybe it adds a BuLi group? No, BuLi is a strong base but isn't an electrophile.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that each step leads to an increase in the number of carbons.

Propionaldehyde has 3 carbons. Let's see:

Step 1: perhaps forms an enolate, no change in carbons.

Step 2: BuLi deprotonates, but maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 forms a dimer. So, two propionaldehyde molecules undergo aldol condensation to form a four-carbon compound. For example, the aldol product would be CH3CH2CH(OH)CHO. Upon dehydration, it becomes CH3CH2C=CHCHO. Wait, but that can't be right because that's a four-carbon aldehyde with a double bond.

But wait, propionaldehyde has three carbons. So the aldol product would have five carbons (two aldehydes combining). Wait, no: when two aldehydes undergo aldol addition, the product is a β-hydroxy aldehyde with n + m carbons, where n and m are the carbons in each aldehyde. So two propionaldehydes (each 3 carbons: CH3CH2CHO) would form a 5-carbon aldol adduct. Then, dehydration would give a 5-carbon α,β-unsaturated aldehyde: CH2=CHCH2CH2CHO? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The aldol addition would form CH3CH2C(OH)CH2CHO. Then, elimination would give CH3CH2C=CHCHO. But that's a five-carbon molecule, with a double bond between C2 and C3, and the aldehyde at C5.

Wait, but the positions might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the dehydration occurs to form a conjugated double bond between C1 and C2, but I'm not certain.

So, moving on, assuming that A is the aldol product (now a five-carbon α,β-unsaturated aldehyde), then step 2 is treatment with BuLi. BuLi is a strong base and a good nucleophile. It could deprotonate the α position, leading to a more substituted enolate. Then, when bromoethane is added in step 3, the enolate would attack the ethyl bromide, adding an ethyl group at the alpha position.

So, after step 3, compound C would have an ethyl group added to the alpha position.

Then, step 4 is treatment with HgCl2, H2O, H+. This is typical oxymercuration, which adds an OH group in a Markovnikov fashion across a double bond. So if compound C has a double bond, oxymercuration would add an OH group to the more substituted carbon of the double bond.

After that, step 5: D is treated with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi to give E.

Hmm, PPh3 is often used in the Staudinger reaction with azides, but maybe in this case, it's part of a substitution. Alternatively, 3-bromopentane is an alkyl bromide, and BuLi is a strong base. Perhaps this is a conjugate addition or a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps step 5 is a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxyl group in D is replaced by an alkyl group from 3-bromopentane, facilitated by PPh3 as a base.

Alternatively, perhaps D has a bromide, and PPh3 is used to substitute it. But I'm not sure.

Another possibility: D is an alcohol, and the reaction is converting the alcohol to a bromide, but I don't see how that fits.

Alternatively, maybe the PPh3 is part of a Mitsunobu reaction, which is used to convert alcohols into other groups. Mitsunobu typically uses DEAD or another azo compound, but perhaps 3-bromopentane is the alkylating agent here.

Wait, Mitsunobu reaction conditions usually involve an azo compound, a phosphine (like PPh3), and an alcohol. The reaction converts the alcohol into another group, typically via an SN2 mechanism. So, if D has an alcohol, the Mitsunobu reaction could be used to replace the OH group with an R group from 3-bromopentane.

Wait, but 3-bromopentane is more of an alkyl bromide, which would be a good leaving group in an SN2 reaction. So perhaps the OH group in D is replaced by a pentyl group (from 3-bromopentane), making E an ether or a larger alcohol?

Alternatively, BuLi in this step might deprotonate a position, allowing for alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps step 5 is a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to outline the steps again and see the structure:

1. Propionaldehyde → aldol condensation → A (an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, 5 carbons).

2. A → treated with BuLi → forms more substituted enolate (B).

3. B reacts with bromoethane → alkylation → adds ethyl group → C.

4. C → oxymercuration → adds OH group → D.

5. D → treated with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, BuLi → substitution → E.

But I'm not sure about the exact structures. Let me think about the possible structures.

Assuming A is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde with 5 carbons:

Structure of A: CH2=CHCH2CH2CHO.

Then, B is the enolate of A. Deprotonating at the alpha position (CH2 next to the carbonyl) would form a conjugate base.

Then, bromoethane (CH2CH2Br) reacts with this enolate. The alkylation would add an ethyl group to the alpha position. So, the enolate attacks CH2CH2Br, adding an ethyl group to the alpha carbon.

So, after step 3, compound C would have an ethyl group on the alpha carbon. So the structure might be CH2-C(Et)-CH2CH2CHO, but I'm not sure about the exact connectivity.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(Et)CH2CHO?

Then, step 4: oxymercuration. The double bond in C would be between which carbons? Let's say C has a double bond between C1 and C2, and an ethyl group on C3.

Oxymercuration would add an OH group to the more substituted carbon of the double bond. So, in C's structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The more substituted carbon is C2, so OH would add to C2, giving D as CH2(OH)CH2CH(Et)CH2CHO.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact positions.

Then, step 5: D is treated with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. If D has an OH group, perhaps the Mitsunobu reaction replaces the OH with a pentyl group from 3-bromopentane. So, the OH in D would become a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group.

Wait, no, 3-bromopentane is CH2CH2CHBrCH2CH3. So, if the Mitsunobu reaction replaces the OH with the R group from 3-bromopentane, the product E would have a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps BuLi is deprotonating a position, allowing for alkylation with 3-bromopentane. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final step is a conjugate addition. For example, if D has a carbonyl group and an adjacent double bond, PPh3 might facilitate a reduction or addition.

Wait, perhaps D has an epoxide, but that's not likely given the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the final step is a substitution where the OH is replaced by a pentyl group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the 13C NMR signals.

The question is about the number of signals, so symmetry and equivalent carbons will matter.

If E ends up being a molecule with multiple substituents and nonequivalent carbons, the number of signals will be higher.

But perhaps the final product is a bicyclic compound or something with multiple substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps each step adds substituents, leading to more distinct carbons.

But maybe I should try to imagine the structure of E.

Let me outline each step again:

1. Propionaldehyde (3 carbons) → aldol condensation → A (5 carbons with a double bond and an aldehyde group).

2. A → enolate → B.

3. B → alkylation with bromoethane → adds an ethyl group → C.

4. C → oxymercuration → adds an OH group → D.

5. D → substitution or reaction → E.

Assuming that step 5 adds a pentyl group via Mitsunobu, E would have an additional pentyl chain, leading to a more complex structure.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to count the signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has multiple unique carbons due to branching and substituents.

Another approach: think about each step's effect on the number of signals.

Propionaldehyde has 3 carbons but only 2 unique in 13C NMR because the CH3 and the CH2 next to the aldehyde are different, but maybe the aldehyde is another carbon. Wait, propionaldehyde has three carbons: CH3-CH2-CHO. So the carbons are CH3 (quaternary?), CH2 (adjacent to aldehyde), and CHO (carbonyl). So three signals.

But after aldol condensation, A would have more carbons. Let's say after step 1, A has 5 carbons. Then step 2 adds an ethyl group, increasing to 6 or 7. Then step 4 adds an OH, which doesn't add a carbon. Then step 5 adds a pentyl group, making it 12 carbons? Hmm, but the options don't go that high.

Wait, the options are 8, 6, 11, 3. So perhaps E has 11 carbons? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe each step doesn't add many carbons but modifies existing ones.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a bicyclic monoterpene, which typically has around 10-12 carbons, but that's just a guess.

But I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should think about the possible answers and what structures would lead to them.

Looking at the options: 8,6,11,3.

Option B is 6, which seems low for a product of multiple reactions. Option D is 3, which would mean a very symmetric molecule, perhaps something like a benzene ring with multiple substituents, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option C is 11, which would imply a complex structure with many unique carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a compound like menthol, which has 9 carbons, but that's not matching any options. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexane, but again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the problem might involve the formation of a bicyclic monoterpene, which would have multiple ring structures, leading to many unique carbons. For example, menthofuran has 11 carbons, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a steroid, but that's probably too complex.

Wait, without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. But perhaps the correct answer is 8 signals.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product has a structure where many carbons are equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Alternatively, maybe each step adds substituents that are symmetrical, leading to a smaller number of signals.

Wait, but if after multiple steps, the molecule has branching and substituents on each carbon, it would have more signals.

Another thought: maybe the final product is cubane, which has 8 carbons, each in a unique environment, leading to 8 signals. But cubane is a cube-shaped molecule, and each corner is a carbon, all equivalent due to symmetry. Wait, but in cubane, each carbon is equivalent, so it would have only one signal. So that's not matching.

Wait, no. Cubane has eight equivalent carbons, each in the same environment. So 13C NMR would show one peak. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, another approach: the first step forms an enolate, which adds an ethyl group, then an OH group via oxymercuration. Then, the final step replaces the OH with a larger substituent. Each substitution adds more complexity, leading to more unique carbons.

If each step adds branching or substituents, the number of signals would increase.

Looking at the options, the highest number is 11. So perhaps the correct answer is C) 11.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the product has 6 unique carbons due to symmetry.

Wait, let me think of the possible structure of E. Suppose after all steps, E has a structure with multiple substituents but some symmetry, leading to 6 signals.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ketone with multiple substituents, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.

I think I'll go with option B) 6, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A)8.

Wait, another angle: each step leads to branching, leading to more unique carbons.

First, propionaldehyde (3 carbons, 3 signals). After aldol condensation, perhaps 5 carbons with some symmetry. Then, alkylation adds an ethyl group, adding 2 more carbons (but maybe some are equivalent). Then, oxymercuration adds another group, increasing complexity. The final step adds a pentyl group, adding 5 more carbons. So total carbons could be 3+2+5=10, but the number of signals depends on symmetry.

But the options don't include 10. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product has 8 unique carbons.

I think I'm stuck, so I'll have to make a guess. Based on the options, I think C) 11 is the most plausible, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves determining the number of 13C-NMR signals for the final product, E, resulting from a series of reactions starting with propionaldehyde. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Step 1**: Propionaldehyde reacts with EDT (KOH) and BF3. This likely forms an enolate, which could be a β-hydroxy aldehyde or an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde after dehydration. The product (A) is hypothesized to be an aldol condensation product with 5 carbons.

2. **Step 2**: A reacts with BuLi, a strong base. This step likely forms a more substituted enolate (B), setting up for alkylation.

3. **Step 3**: B reacts with bromoethane, an alkylating agent. This adds an ethyl group to the α-position, increasing the complexity of the molecule (C).

4. **Step 4**: C undergoes oxymercuration (HgCl2, H2O, H+), which adds a hydroxyl group across the double bond in a Markovnikov fashion, forming D.

5. **Step 5**: D reacts with PPh3, 3-bromopentane, and BuLi. This step is interpreted as a substitution or alkylation reaction, likely replacing the hydroxyl group with a pentyl group, forming E.

The final product, E, is expected to have a complex structure with multiple substituents and branching, leading to many unique carbons in its 13C-NMR spectrum. Considering the options provided (A: 8, B: 6, C: 11, D: 3), the most plausible number of signals is 11, as the reactions introduce significant structural complexity and reduce symmetry.

Answer: C
