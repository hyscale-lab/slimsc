Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with reactions involving dicarboxylic acids, their dehydration to anhydrides, and then a reaction with tetramethylcyclopentadiene. The products are two, with the major and minor being determined, and their NMR spectra are mentioned. The key part is about the NOESY spectrum, which shows a cross-peak in the major product but not the minor.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, the initial steps: a cis-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given. The proton NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually aromatic protons. But wait, an anhydride typically has carbonyl groups. But a singlet at 7 ppm... Maybe it's a proton adjacent to carbonyl, or maybe it's a conjugated system like in an aromatic structure. But since it's an anhydride, maybe the structure is cyclic, like a cyclic anhydride. For example, maleic anhydride has protons as a singlet around that region?

Wait, maleic anhydride has two doublet protons at around 6.5 ppm each, but that's when the substituents are in the trans configuration. But if the starting material was cis, the anhydride would be cis as well. So maybe the structure is such that the protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the protons are not directly on the ring but elsewhere.

Looking at the 13C NMR: two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. Carbon at 165 is likely a carbonyl, maybe the anhydride oxygen. The 137 ppm is probably a spÂ² hybridized carbon, maybe part of a double bond or ring structure. So in the anhydride, which carbons would that be?

Wait, an anhydride typically has two carbonyl groups (like in succinic anhydride, for example). So the 165 ppm would be the carbonyl carb
