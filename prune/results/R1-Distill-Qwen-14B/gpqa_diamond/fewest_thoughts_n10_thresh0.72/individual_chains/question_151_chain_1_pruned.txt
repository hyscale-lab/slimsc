Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, that seems a bit odd because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors usually have to be normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. Let me check that. The state vector components are -1, 2, and 1. So the norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, right, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. But in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors to represent probabilities correctly. So I think the first thing I should do is normalize this state vector.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention normalizing it. Hmm. Maybe it's given as a non-normalized vector, and I have to use it as is. But that would cause the probabilities to be wrong because probabilities come from the squared magnitudes, so perhaps the vector needs to be normalized before anything else. Let me think about that.

So, the state vector is |Ïˆ> = [ -1; 2; 1 ]. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. I think I should proceed by using this normalized state because otherwise, probabilities won't add up properly.

Next, there's an observable P given by a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So the matrix P looks something like this:

[ [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
  [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
  [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0] ]

I need to find the probability that measuring this observable P will yield 0. In quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of
