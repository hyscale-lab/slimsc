Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is about a spin 1/2 particle. I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their spin angular momentum in units of ħ/2. The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma multiplied by Sz. Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. So mu = gamma * Sz.

The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field, which probably means it's in the lowest energy state, but maybe that's not critical right now.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. So after the field switch, the particle's magnetic moment is now subject to a magnetic field in the Y direction. I think I need to model the time evolution of the spin state under this new field.

I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the Hamiltonian for the system is H = -mu·B. But wait, mu is related to spin, so H would be proportional to the dot product of the spin operator and the magnetic field.

Wait, more accurately, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * S, where S is the spin operator. So the Hamiltonian should be H = -mu · B. Since both mu and B are vectors, their dot product would be the sum of their components multiplied together.

In this case, when the field switches from Z to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. Initially, when the field was along Z, the Hamiltonian would have been H_initial = -gamma * B * Sz. But when the field is turned off, that's zero. Then, the new field is along Y, so H_final = -gamma * B * Sy.

Wait, no, because mu is gamma * S, and the magnetic field is in Y direction. So H = - mu · B = -gamma * S · B. Since B is along Y, it's H = -gamma * B * Sy. So yeah, H = -gamma B Sy.

The state of the spin before the field change was along +Z. So the spin was in the eigenstate of Sz. Let's
