Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options, a to d, each with different characteristics. Let me read them again carefully.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth in both mass and radius. Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that from school. So this planet's density would be the same as Earth's.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. So they state the density directly here. So this planet's density is about 5.5, same as Earth, but has twice the mass. But wait, density is mass over volume. If the mass increases but the density stays the same, the volume must have increased. Because density is mass divided by volume. So if mass doubles and density is same, volume must double. So the radius would be larger than Earth's. Because volume scales with radius cubed. So if volume doubles, radius goes up by cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times. So this planet is bigger than Earth but same density.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, so composition is same, meaning same density. Because if it's made of the same stuff, the density should be same. So this planet's density is 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, its mass is 5 Earth masses. So then, using density = mass/volume, and same density, the volume would be 5 times larger than Earth's. But volume scales with radius cubed, so the radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius. Cube root of 5 is about 1.71, so radius is larger than Earth. But density-wise, same as Earth.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass. So again, same composition implies same density. So density is 5.5. Mass is half Earth's, so the volume would be half that of Earth. So the radius would be cube root of 0.5, which is roughly 0.79 Earth radii. So a smaller planet, but same density.

Wait, but wait. The question is which has the highest density. So let's look at the options again.

Option a: same as Earth, so 5.5.

Option b: given density is 5.5. So same as a.

Option c: same composition as Earth, so same density of 5.5.

Option d: same composition, same 5.5.

Wait, that can't be right. Because all options a, b, c, d have the same density. But that can't be the case because the options are presented as different choices.

Wait, no. Let me read the options again.

Wait, option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5. So yes, density is 5.5.

But option c says same composition as Earth but 5 Earth masses. Since composition affects density, same composition implies same density as Earth, which is 5.5.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the options
