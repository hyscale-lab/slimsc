Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. But wait, how does that apply when comparing different planets?

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet's characteristics. I need to find out which has the highest density.

Let me list out each option:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? Because that's what I learned when studying Earth's structure.

b) 2 Earth masses and density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but isn't density a separate property? If it's given directly, then this planet's density is exactly 5.5. But what about the mass and radius? Oh, wait, no. Because density is mass over volume. So if its mass is twice Earth's, but the density is same as Earth, that would imply the radius is sqrt(2) times Earth's, because volume scales with radius cubed. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for density is ρ = M/V. So if a planet has twice Earth's mass, but the same density, its volume would have to be twice Earth's volume. Since volume is (4/3)πr³, so the radius would be cube root of (2) times Earth's radius. So maybe a bit bigger than Earth.

But for option b, the density is given as 5.5 g/cm³, same as Earth
