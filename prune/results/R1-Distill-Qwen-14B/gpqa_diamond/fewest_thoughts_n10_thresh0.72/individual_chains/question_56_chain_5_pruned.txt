Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom's energy levels and transitions. Hmm, I remember that electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules. The question is about a specific decay process.

The state given is |3,0,0⟩, which in standard notation is n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Wait, so it's a two-step process because going from n=3 to n=1 directly might not be allowed? Or maybe it's because the selection rules restrict the transitions to certain steps.

I think the selection rules for dipole transitions are that Δl = ±1, and Δn = ±1 as well. Oh wait, no, wait: For dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δn can be any integer as long as the other conditions are met. Or was it that Δn can be ±1? Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the transition is electric dipole, so the selection rules are:

Δl = ±1 (so l can increase or decrease by 1)
Δn = any integer, but for hydrogen-like atoms, the energy levels are quantized, so the electron can only transition between adjacent n levels? Or is that not the case?

Wait, no, no. The selection rules for dipole transitions are actually Δl = ±1, and Δn can be 0, ±1, but wait no, that's not right. Let me clarify:

The electric dipole selection rules are that the change in angular momentum (l) must be ±1, and the change in principal quantum number (n) can be any integer, but in practice, transitions are usually between adjacent n levels because the energy differences are more likely to be matched. But I might have that wrong.

Wait, wait a second. I remember another point: for an electron to transition from a higher energy state to a lower one via two photon emissions, each transition must follow the selection rules. So for each dipole transition, the changes must be Δl = ±1, and Δn can be ±1. Or is that not necessary?

Wait, the question specifies that the transition is via two dipole transitions. So the |3,0,0> state (n=3, l=0) must go through two steps to reach |1,0,0> (n=1, l=0). So each transition is a dipole transition.

First transition: from n=3, l=0. What l's are allowed in the next state? Since Δl can be ±1, l can go from 0 to 1. So the first state after the first transition must have l=1.

So the first transition must go from (3,0,0) to some (n',1,m'), where n' is either 2 or 4. But since it's decaying to a lower energy, n' must be less than 3. So n' can be 2. Because if n=3 goes to n=4, that's higher energy, which wouldn't be a decay. So the first step is (3,0,0) → (2,1, m').

Now, what m' can be? The selection rule for m is Δm = 0, ±1. So from m=0, the next state can have m = -1, 0, +1.

So after the first transition, the state could be |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,1⟩. Then from that state, we make another transition to reach |1,0,0⟩.

So the second transition must go from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0. So again, Δl must be ±1. Since initial l is 1, it can go to 0 or 2. But n=2 can only go to n=1 or 3. But the final state has n=1, so that's possible.

So the second transition must have Δl=-1 (since l was 1 and now 0). So from |2,1,m⟩, the next state is |1,0, m''⟩. What m'' can be? The initial m is whatever it was in the first step, so for example, if the first step went to m=0, the next m can be -1, 0, or +1. But the final state has m=0, so that's the only option possible.

Wait, but in the second transition, the m can change by 0, ±1. So let's think:

Case 1: First transition to |2,1,0⟩. Then, in the second transition, m can go to m = -1, 0, +1. But the final state requires m=0. So yes, possible.

Case 2: First transition to |2,1,1⟩. Then, in the second transition, m can go to 2,1,0. So from m=1, the next m can be 0, which is allowed.

Case 3: First transition to |2,1,-1⟩. Then, in the second step, m can go to -2, -1, 0. So again, m=0 is possible.

So all three possibilities are allowed. But the question is about the transition route and the corresponding probability.

Wait, but the options given have specific transition routes. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A) 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. Probability 1/3.

B) 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 →1,0
