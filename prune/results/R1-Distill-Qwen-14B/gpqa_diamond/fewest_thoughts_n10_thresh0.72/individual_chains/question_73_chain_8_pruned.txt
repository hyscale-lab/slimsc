Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two velocities, right? Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't use the classical velocity addition formula. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Let me think... Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)). So I should apply that.

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. Let me plug these into the formula. So v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c^2)). Simplifying the numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7. Wait, 0.1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 0.142857... So roughly 0.14c. That would be the relative speed.

So looking at the options, which ones have a relative speed around 0.14c? Let's see. Option C says 0.14c, and D also has 0.14c. So either C or D is a possibility for the relative speed part.

Now, the total energy of the system. I think I need to calculate the rest energy plus the kinetic energy for each astronaut and sum them up. Or wait, actually, in relativity, each object's total energy is given by gamma times mc². So for each astronaut, compute gamma multiplied by their mass, and then add the two energies together.

Let me calculate each gamma. For the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v squared is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36c². So denominator under the square root is 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So the energy for astronaut A is gamma * m_rest. Wait, wait, the mass is 2m, so E_A = 1.25 * (2m) c² → 2.5 mc².

Then astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma for B is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Hmm, sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So 1/0.866 is about 1.1547. Let me see, sqrt(3/4) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So 1 divided by that is 2/sqrt(3) ≈1.1547.

Therefore, E_B = gamma * mass * c² → 1.1547 * 3m c². Let's compute that: 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.4641. So E_B is approximately 3.4641 mc².

Adding E_A and E_B: 2.5 + 3.4641 ≈5.9641 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D says E=5mc², which is lower than what I just calculated.

So the total energy should be about 5.96 mc² and the relative speed around 0.14c. So option C is the one that matches both.

Wait, but the question says, what is the relative speed and the total energy of the system. So the system's energy is the sum of each astronaut's energy.

Wait, wait, another thought: the system would include both astronauts. So in the rest frame of the problem, but wait, no—each astronaut is in their own frame, but the system's rest frame isn't necessarily either of theirs. So when calculating the total energy, we just add their energies in the same frame, which is the frame where the problem is presented. But wait, the problem is stated in the lab frame, which is perhaps the rest frame where both are moving. Hmm, no, more accurately, the problem states their speeds in the positive x-direction, so I think the frame in which each astronaut is moving is the same for both.

Wait, no, because the problem says "travel at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction." So they are each moving in the same direction in the lab frame. So the lab frame is where we calculate
