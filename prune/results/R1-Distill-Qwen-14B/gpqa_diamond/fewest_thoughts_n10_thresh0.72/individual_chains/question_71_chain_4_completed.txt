Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's break it down. The planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Oh wait, that's for Planet_1 through Planet_5. So, I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is based on the inverse square law. The temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and 'a' is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, sometimes it's presented differently. Oh right, another version is T = T_star * ( L_star / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4). But since all planets are around the same star, and assuming the same albedo, I can ignore the star's specifics and focus on the orbital distances.

Wait, the albedo is the same, so the absorption factor is the same. So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, or wait, no. Wait, the orbital period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law. Because Kepler's law says that (P^2) is proportional to (a^3), assuming the same star. So P² ∝ a³.

So if the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, then the periods are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. 

But wait, for each planet, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L) / (16π a² σ) )^(1/4), but since L and all other star parameters are the same, T is proportional to (1/a)^(1/2). Because (1/a²)^(1/4) is (1/a)^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/√a.

But from Kepler's law, a³ ∝ P². So a ∝ P^(2/3). So 1/a ∝ P^(-2/3). Therefore, T ∝ P^(-1/3). Because T is proportional to 1/√a = (a)^(-1/2), and a is P^(2/3), so T is P^(- (2/3) * (1/2) ) )= P^(-1/3).

So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So T ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So the ratio of temperatures T4/T2 would be (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. Because T is directly proportional to (1/a)^(1/2), and a is directly proportional to P^(2/3). So T is proportional to (1/(P^(2/3)))^(1/2) = P^(-1/3). So higher period (farther planet) would have lower temperature.

So T4 is the temperature of planet 4, which has period P4. T2 is for planet 2, which has P2.

So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Because T ∝ P^(-1/3), so T4 = K * P4^(-1/3), T2 = K * P2^(-1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Let me write it:

T ∝ 1/√a.

But a³ = (G M / (4π²)) P² → a ∝ P^(2/3).

So 1/√a = 1/( P^(2/3 * 1/2) ) ) = 1/( P^(1/3) )

So T ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → T ∝ P^(-1/3).

So T4 = C * P4^(-1/3), T2 = C * P2^(-1/3).

So T4 / T2 = [ P2 / P4 ]^(1/3 ).

So I need to find the ratio of periods P2 and P4.

Looking at the given ratio: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for P1:P2:P3:P4:P5.

So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5.

So P2/P4 = 2 / 3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So [P2/P4]^(1/3) = (4/7)^(1/3).

Wait, 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. Let me compute the cube root of 0.5714.

Hmm, what's 0.5714? Let's think: 0.5714 is approximately 4/7.

Cube root of 4 is a bit over 1.5 (since 1.5^3=3.375). Cube root of 7 is approx 1.913.

So cube root of (4/7) = cube_root(4)/cube_root(7) ≈ 1.5874 / 1.913 ≈ approximately 0.83.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1.5874 divided by 1.913 is approximately 0.83. But wait, 1.5874 is the cube root of 4, and 1.913 is cube root of 7. So yeah.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it numerically.

4/7 ≈ 0.5714. Let's find the cube root of 0.5714.

Well, 0.8^3 is 0.512, 0.82^3 is 0.82 * 0.82 = 0.6724, 0.6724 * 0.82 ≈ 0.551368. 0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83=0.6889, *0.83= approx 0.571787. Wow, that's really close to 0.5714.

So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.83.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm: 0.83^3 = approx 0.571. So if the ratio P2/P4 is 0.5714, then the cube root is 0.83. So T4/T2 is 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. Option D is 0.75, which is 3/4. So 0.83 is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Are you sure about the ratio? Because the question is about the ratio T4/T2, and the periods are P2 and P4.

Wait, the ratio is (P2/P4)^(1/3). So 2/3.5 = 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. So (4/7)^(1/3) is about 0.83.

So the ratio T4/T2 = 0.83.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). From Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto P^2 \), so \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Substituting this into the temperature formula, \( T \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). Thus, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period.

Given the orbital period ratios \( P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5 \), we find the ratio of periods for Planet_2 and Planet_4 as \( P_2/P_4 = 2/3.5 = 4/7 \approx 0.5714 \). The temperature ratio is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3} = (0.5714)^{1/3}.
\]

Approximating the cube root of \( 0.5714 \), we find it is close to \( 0.83 \). Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \).

From the given options:
- **A) ~0.57**: Too low.
- **B) ~0.69**: Too low.
- **C) ~0.83**: Correct, matches the calculated value.
- **D) ~0.75**: Slightly lower than the correct value.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
