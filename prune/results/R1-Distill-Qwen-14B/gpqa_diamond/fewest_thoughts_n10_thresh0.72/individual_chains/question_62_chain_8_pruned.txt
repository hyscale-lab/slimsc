Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to understand the structure of the target molecule. So, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me visualize this. The main chain is a cyclohexane ring. The substituents on this ring are a carbaldehyde group (CHO) and a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the same carbon (since it's 1-substituted). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the position is 1, so it's attached to the same carbon as the cyclohexane. So the carbon where the cyclohexane is attached has a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)CH2?) Wait, maybe I should draw it out in my mind: the cyclohexane ring has at position 1 a substituent that's a methyl group attached to another cyclohexane and also a hydroxyl group. So, it's like a cyclohexane ring with a -CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a CHO group on the same carbon? Or perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, and then that CH(OH) is attached to the cyclohexane. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has a CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a carbonyl group (CHO). Wait, no, because the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the carbaldehyde is on the cyclohexane ring, and the (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) is attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde.

Wait, no. Let me parse the name. The parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohex
