Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I'm assuming that's a two-component spinor, right? So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T. Or maybe it's written as (3i,4), but I suppose it's a column vector. 

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Right, that's the general approach. Since S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction, I need to know what that operator looks like in matrix form. The note says σ_y is the Pauli matrix, which is:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

And the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. Oh wait, because for electrons, the spin is 1/2, so the spin operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y.

So putting it together, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

Now the expectation value is ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Let's break that down into steps.

First, I need to compute S_y multiplied by the state vector χ. Then, multiply the resulting vector by the conjugate transpose of χ to get the inner product.

But wait, the state χ is (3i, 4). So as a column vector, it's:
[3i]
[4]

And the conjugate transpose (bra vector) would be [3i*, 4*], which since 3i is imaginary, its conjugate is -3i. And 4 is real, so it's 4. So the bra is [-3i, 4].

So let's compute S_y acting on χ.

S_y * χ = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i
