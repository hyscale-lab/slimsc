Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read through it again.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what reagent A and catalyst B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The 3-methyl substitution means there's a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure would be a pyrrolidine ring with a methyl on one of the carbons next to the nitrogen.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let's break that down. The main part is the pyrrolidine. The substituent is at position 1. It's cyclohexylidenemethyl, which I think is a cyclohexane ring attached via a methylene group (CH₂) but in a ring structure. Wait, cyclohexylidene means a cyclohexane ring with a double bond to the substituent. So maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached through a methylene group.

Wait, no, cyclohexylidene would be a substituent where the cyclohexane is connected via a double bond. Like, a cyclohexane ring with a double bond to the main chain. So maybe the structure is a pyrrolidine ring with a substituent that is a methylene (CH₂) group, which is connected to a cyclohexene ring.

Wait, perhaps it's a ring formation. The product is a bicyclic structure? Or maybe a substituent that's a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine.

I think this is a reaction where the amine group in pyrrolidine is acting as a nucleophile. So perhaps the reaction is some kind of alkylation or acylation.

Wait, acid-catalyzed reactions of amines. Common reactions include alkylation, such as using an alkyl halide, but that's typically in presence of an acid as a catalyst
