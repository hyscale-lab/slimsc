Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. I remember that each spectrograph has different magnitude limits. Let me think through the given information step by step.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning anything with V ≤ 17. HIRES can observe brighter than 16, so V ≤16. So a star must have V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So any star with V >16 can't be seen by HIRES, so it's out of the picture.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So that means it can see stars with V ≤17, right? Because when they say 'brighter than X', that's lower magnitude. Because lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is V=17, it's the limit for ESPRESSO. HIRES can do up to 16, so it's even brighter. So any star that is brighter than (V <16) can be seen by both, but what about stars with V=16? ESPRESSO can see it, HIRES can see it. So the maximum V magnitude that both can detect is 16.

So any star that's apparent V magnitude ≤16 can be detected by both. Or wait, no, wait: the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." So V≤17. For HIRES, brighter than 16, so V ≤16. So the overlapping is V ≤16.

So a star must have apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both.

So let's look at each star's apparent V magnitude. Wait, but some of them don't directly give apparent magnitude. Some give absolute magnitude and distance. Others give apparent magnitude. So I'll need to calculate apparent magnitude where necessary.

Let me list the stars:

Star1: Absolute V=15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent V is absolute + distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10(d/10) where d is distance in pc. For 10 pc, modulus is 0. So apparent V is 15.5. So 15.5 is ≤16, so it's within both limits. So Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. Which is above 16, so HIRES can't see it. So Star2 can't be detected by both; only ESPRESSO can.

Star3: Apparent V is
