Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshift. Hmm, let me see. The question is about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. The clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet range, so if it's being absorbed, that must have something to do with redshift.

Wait, redshift comes into play when the universe expands, causing the wavelength of light to stretch. So if a quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen clouds, the absorption line will be shifted to a longer wavelength (redshifted) depending on how far away the cloud is.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light. So the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range, which I think starts around 4000 Angstroms or maybe a bit higher. Wait, no. Visible light is roughly from 400 to 700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So 4000 is the lower limit for optical?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. But optical telescopes can't detect that because of atmospheric absorption. So if the absorption line is redshifted into the optical range, we can detect it.

So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that the 1216 Angstrom line is shifted into the optical. So the observed wavelength (obs) must be greater than or equal to the lower limit of optical. Let me think, what's the lower end of optical? I think the limit is about 350 nm (3500 Angstroms) because below that, it's UV and not observable from the ground. Wait, but wait, some optical telescopes can go a bit into the near-UV, like down to around 300 nm. But maybe for ground-based, it's more like 400 nm as the start of the visible? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, maybe the lower limit for optical is
