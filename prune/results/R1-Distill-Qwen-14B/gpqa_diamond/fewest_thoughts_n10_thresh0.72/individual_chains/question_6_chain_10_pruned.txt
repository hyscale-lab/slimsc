Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions for energy in terms of n_x and n_y, which are probably quantum numbers.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with potentials in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, it's helpful to see if the potential can be broken down into parts that are separable. Because if it's separable, we can solve the Schrödinger equation in terms of radial and angular parts.

Looking at the potential, it's V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor this a bit. I can factor out (1/2)kr², which gives (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Oh, wait, no, actually, 1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ. Wait, let me compute that properly. 1/2 + 3/2 = 2, but that's not right because it's 1/2 + 3/2 times cos²θ. So actually, the potential isn't a sum of purely radial and purely angular terms. Wait, but maybe I can rewrite it to see if it's a sum of such terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can separate the potential into a purely radial part and a part involving cos²θ. Let me see. The first term is 1/2 kr², which is radial. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that's like adding a perturbation. But wait, in two dimensions, perhaps the angular part can be considered as a harmonic oscillator? Because cos²θ is related to cos(2θ), which is part of the angular components in polar coordinates.

Let me think about the potential in terms of effective potential. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to switch to Cartesian coordinates. Because in two dimensions, sometimes it's easier to express the potential in terms of x and y. Let's try that.

So in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, sinθ
