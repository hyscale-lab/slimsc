Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope setup. Hmm, let me think through this. So Mike is trying to create an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, right? The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr. But even with that, some gas molecules are still there because the mass spectrometer detected them. 

He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, if I remember correctly. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecule diameter, and p is pressure. 

But then, when he starts the electron beam, something changes. The mean free path becomes λ2 instead of staying λ1. The question is, why? And what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Wait, the temperature remained the same, so T is the same. The pressure didn't change because the pumps are still running, I think. So why would the mean free path change?

Oh, wait, electron beam. When the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. I remember that in such cases, the gas molecules can get ionized or excited by the electrons. So maybe the gas molecules become charged, which affects their behavior.

If the gas particles are charged, perhaps they interact more with the electron beam, but how does that affect their mean free path? Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to become a plasma, but that's probably not the case here since the pressure is ultra-low.

Wait, another thought: when the gas particles are neutral, their mean free path is λ1. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons can cause the gas molecules to ionize. So the gas becomes a mix of ions and electrons. But wait, ions have a much longer mean free path because their collisions are less frequent. Because ions have more mass, they don't collide as often as neutral molecules. So, the mean free path for the charged particles (ions) would be longer than that of the neutral molecules.

But wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. If the gas becomes partially ionized, then the number of neutral molecules decreases. The mean free path for the remaining neutral molecules would actually increase, because there's less of them to collide with. Alternatively, if the gas is now a plasma, the mean free path for the charged particles might be longer, but I'm not sure how that ties into the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the electrons in the beam are causing the gas molecules to scatter more. Wait, but the electrons are moving much faster than the gas molecules. When a fast electron hits a gas molecule, it can cause scattering. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas?

Wait, perhaps the gas molecules, when hit by electrons, either gain energy or change direction. Maybe the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure on the gas. Or perhaps it's the other way around: the beam causes the gas to become more excited, leading to more collisions, which would decrease the mean free path
