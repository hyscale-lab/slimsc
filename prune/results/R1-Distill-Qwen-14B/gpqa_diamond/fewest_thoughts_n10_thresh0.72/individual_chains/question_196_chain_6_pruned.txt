Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is straightforward, but relativistically, things get more complicated because of the speed limits imposed by relativity.

The question gives a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in the non-relativistic scenario, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, for a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA². Setting that equal to (1/2)mv_max² would give v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so that's probably not the right answer here.

Relativistically, the energy isn't just kinetic; it includes the rest mass energy. The total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. But in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but wait, maybe in this context, it's treated classically? Because the question is phrased about maximum speed, which suggests a classical approach.

So, let's think. The total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (amplitude A), the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic energy is zero. So, E = (1
