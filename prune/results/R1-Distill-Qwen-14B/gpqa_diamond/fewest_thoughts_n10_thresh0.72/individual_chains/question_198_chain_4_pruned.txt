Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. Hmm, let's break it down.

Alright, the problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN⁻] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, wait. I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think about the complexes.

Cobalt can form complexes with thiocyanate in different stoichiometries. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)ₙ²⁺ where n is the number of SCN⁻ ligands. So, β1 would be for Co(SCN)²⁺, β2 for Co(SCN)₂²⁺, β3 for Co(SCN)₃²⁺, and β4 for Co(SCN)₄²⁺? Or wait, maybe β4 is for a different charge? Hmm, not sure, but I think each β corresponds to progressively more ligands.

But wait, in the question, the blue dithiocyanato complex is mentioned. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN⁻ ligands, right? So that would be Co(SCN)₂²⁺, which is associated with β2=40. Or wait, maybe the blue one is Co(SCN)₂³+? Hmm, no, because cobalt is +2. Let me double-check. Co²+ with two SCN⁻ would be Co(SCN)₂²⁺, which is a neutral complex? Wait, wait, SCN⁻ is -1 each. So two of them would be -2. So Co²+ plus two SCN⁻ gives Co(SCN)₂²⁺, which would have a charge of 0. Oh, so it's a neutral complex. Hmm, that makes sense because thioc
