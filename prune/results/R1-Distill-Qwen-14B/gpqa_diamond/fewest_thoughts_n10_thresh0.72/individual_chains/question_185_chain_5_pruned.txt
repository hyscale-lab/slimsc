Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon multiplied by the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, right?

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z, each a 2x2 matrix. The dot product here would involve summing the products of each component. So, sigma · n would be sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. And n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² equals 1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian is H = ε times that dot product. So H is ε times (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). Now, since sigma matrices are Hermitian, H must also be Hermitian because it's a sum of Hermitian matrices multiplied by real constants. So eigenvalues should be real.

The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix component are ±1/2 when multiplied by some factors. Wait, let me think again. Each Pauli matrix, like sigma_x, has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when they're multiplied by a coefficient, how does that affect the eigenvalues?

Wait, more accurately, if you have a matrix like a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z, the eigenvalues are sqrt(a² + b² + c²) multiplied by ±1. Because the Pauli matrices are orthonormal in the sense that their sum of squares gives the identity matrix multiplied by something.

Wait, let's calculate. The square of H would be H^2 = (epsilon^2) (sigma · n)^2. The square of sigma · n is (sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z)^2. Expanding this would be sigma_x^2 n_x^2 + sigma_y^2 n_y^2 + sigma_z^2 n_z^2 plus cross terms.

But each sigma_i squared is the identity matrix times 1. Because sigma_x^2 is I, same for sigma_y and sigma_z. So sigma · n squared is (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I = I. Because n is a unit vector, the sum of squares is 1.

So H squared is (epsilon^2) * I. Taking
