Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with a "size estimate" written next to it. The expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this expression.

Wait, Feynman diagrams and loop diagrams... I remember that the number of loops in a diagram is related to the topology of the diagram. Each loop typically contributes a factor of the coupling constant and some factors from integrals, like from the loop momentum integrations. Also, the overall scaling of the amplitude can give clues about the number of loops.

So, the general structure for a Feynman diagram's amplitude would involve factors from vertices, propagators, and loops. Each loop introduces an integral over a momentum, which might involve factors like 4pi from the integral in four dimensions, and factors from the loop itself like the number of ways to contract momenta (maybe 8 from the volume of the rotation group? Like 2pi^2 or something like that? Wait, wait, I think the integral over the loop momentum in four dimensions includes a 2pi^2 factor, but I'm not exactly sure.)

Looking at the given expression, let's break it down:

- alpha^3: Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0) or something like that. But in terms of Feynman diagrams, each vertex in QED contributes a factor of e (or alpha^(1/2) because alpha is eÂ²/(4pi)), so for example a one-loop diagram might have a vertex factor squared or something. Wait, but the exact relation between alpha and the number of vertices and loops probably depends on the process.

- g^2: That's probably the coupling constant squared. So maybe this is a theory with some interactions beyond QED, like a non-Abelian gauge theory or something else. Each vertex would bring a factor of g.

- sqrt(2): Not sure what that comes from. Maybe combinatorial factors from the number of ways the diagram can be arranged. Or perhaps from
