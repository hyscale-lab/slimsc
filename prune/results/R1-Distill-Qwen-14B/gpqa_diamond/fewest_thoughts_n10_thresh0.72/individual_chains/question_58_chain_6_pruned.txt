Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, let me think about each option. I know that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. It deals with electrons and photons. I remember that in QED, you get these divergent integrals when calculating things like the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization. So they must use regularization methods, like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization, to handle those infinities.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. QCD does require regularization because of similar divergences, especially when dealing with things like the running of coupling constants and the structure of hadrons. Without regularization, calculations would also blow up to infinity, so they must use techniques like lattice regularization or others.

Superstring Theory is a bit different. It's a theory that describes particles as strings, and it incorporates supersymmetry. I think string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that QED and QCD have. Because strings have a length scale (the
