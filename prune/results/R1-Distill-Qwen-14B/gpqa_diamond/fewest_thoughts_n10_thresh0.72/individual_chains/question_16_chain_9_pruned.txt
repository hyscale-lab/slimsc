Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually happens if the molecule has chiral centers. But wait, there's more to it than that. Let me think about each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. So, it's a butene with a double bond between C1 and C2. Chlorine is on C1, and a methyl is on C2. The double bond is in position 1. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. Or wait, no. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, a methyl on C2, and a double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH2? Wait, but I'm probably getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH- group. Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is
