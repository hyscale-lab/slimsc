Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again. So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I don't think the masses directly affect the abundance calculations, since the problem gives the elemental ratios we need. 

The given data is about their elemental abundances using the EW method under LTE. The values provided are:

Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.
Similarly, for Mg:
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, let me make sure I get that right. The formula is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. So for Star 1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means their Fe/H ratio is the same as the Sun. Similarly for Star 2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg/H is solar.

So for Star_1, since [Fe/H] is 0, Fe abundance is same as Sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is equal to solar.

Now, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. The definition of [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(Si/Fe)_star1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Let me compute what [Si/Fe]_sun is. Since [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, for the Sun, it's zero. Wait, no. Wait, [X/Y] is relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [X/Y] is 0.

Wait, no, the formula is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun would be zero. So for Star 1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3, which means that (log(Si/Fe)_1) = 0.3 + (log(Si/Fe)_sun). But since for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun is 0, the star's log(Si/Fe) is 0.3.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting that wrong. Let's correct.

The [X/Y] notation is defined as:
[X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So, for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

But for the Sun, log(nSi/nFe)_sun is [Si/Fe]_sun, which is 0. So Star_1's log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3. Thus, nSi/nFe (star1) = 10^(0.3) ≈ 2.

Wait, because log(a) = b → a=10^b. So 0.3 → 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So nSi/nFe = 2 in Star_1.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg/nSi)_sun = 0.3.

Again, for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, so log(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 → nMg/nSi = 10^0.3 ≈ 2 in Star_2.

Wait, but we need the ratio of silicon in the photospheres. So the problem asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, ratio = nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Wait,
