Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear decay. Hmm, let's read the question again.

So the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Now, in the variant, it's emitting one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, I remember that in nuclear decays, the emitted particles' energy spectrum is usually continuous if there's a lot of energy released and multiple particles involved. Like in beta decay, the electrons have a continuous spectrum because the Q value is shared among the electron, antineutrino, and the recoiling nucleus.

In the original case, 2E and 2V are emitted. So maybe V is some other type of particle, like a pion or something else. Since E and V are lighter, perhaps they're electrons or positrons, but not sure. But the key is their energy spectrum.

In the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. That suggests that their energies can vary, up to a maximum value Q. I think this is because when you have multiple particles emitted, their energies are shared in various ways, leading to a range of possible energies for each.

In the variant, instead of 2V, we have one M, which is massless. Massless... so like a photon? Because photons are massless and move at the speed of light. But M is described as an exotic particle, so maybe it's another kind of boson or something else, but the key is it's massless.

So how does replacing two V particles (which probably have some mass) with a single massless M affect the decay products?

In the original case, the decay products are 2B, which I assume are the same as the initial A's but transformed. Then 2E and 2V. So each E and each V would carry some energy.

Wait, but in the variant, it's 2E and M. So instead of two V's, we have one M. So the number of particles is different. Let's think about the energy and momentum conservation.

In the original decay, since two particles (V) are emitted along with the E's, the energies of E and V would be correlated. Because when you have multiple particles
