Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and boson decay. Let's see what it's about. The question gives a Lagrangian term involving a boson X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the allowed decay channels at the lowest order.

Hmm, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh, perhaps it's something like L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe it's more like the interaction term is λ f ψ_f X ψ_f or something else. Wait, perhaps the term is more like L = -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y). Because the v is usually a vacuum expectation value, but maybe in this case, X is the field, and the interaction is X coupling to fermions.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is of the form L = - λ f ψ_f X ψ_f, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Yukawa coupling type interaction, where X is the scalar field and ψ_f are the fermions. So the interaction term would be something like L = - g X ψ_f ψ_f, where g is the coupling constant. So the coupling would be between the boson X and a pair of fermions ψ_f.

Wait, but the way the Lagrangian is written in the question is a bit unclear. Let me re-express it. The user wrote:

mathcal{L}(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ} f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, perhaps that's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be \bar{ψ}_f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction term would be -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), assuming v is a constant (like the VEV), so the term with X is the interaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is -λ X \bar{ψ}_f ψ_f. So the interaction is X coupling to a fermion-antifermion pair.

In any case, the key point is that the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, provided the fermion masses are less than half of X's mass.

Because for a particle to decay, the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. Also, since X is a boson, the decay products must be a fermion and its antiparticle. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the mass of each fermion is less than (M_X)/2.

The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay must have a mass less than 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV /2 =3 GeV. Wait, but some fermions have masses higher than that. Let me list the known fermion masses.

Quarks: up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. But the top quark is way too heavy, about 173 GeV, so that's way above 3 GeV. The bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, then 6 GeV/2 =3 GeV. So any fermion with mass m <3 GeV can be produced. Let's see: up, down, strange, charm. Wait, but the charm quark is around 1.2-1.5 GeV, so that's under 3. So, but the bottom quark is around 4.7, which is higher than 3. So, decay into b and anti-b would require each b to have mass less than 3 GeV, but they are heavier. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Wait, but wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think: the decay X → f f-bar requires that 2 m_f ≤ M_X. Because each fermion would have mass m_f, so 2 m_f must be ≤ M_X.

So for each fermion f, if 2 m_f ≤ M_X, then decay is possible. So M_X is 6 GeV. So 2 m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV?

Let's list them:

- Electron (m ~0.0005 GeV → yes)
- Muon (m ~0.105 GeV → yes)
- Tau (m ~1.777 GeV → yes, because 1.777 <3)
- Up quark (mass ~2.2 MeV → yes)
- Down quark (mass ~4.7 MeV → yes)
- Strange quark (mass ~95-100 MeV → yes)
- Charm quark (mass ~1.2-1.5 GeV → yes)
- Bottom quark (mass ~4.7 GeV → no, because 4.7 >3)
- Top quark (mass ~173 GeV → no)
- What about the others, like the neutrinos? Their masses are negligible, so they are allowed, but the problem doesn't list options that include them. The options don't have neutrinos listed.

Wait but the options don't include all possible fermions, so perhaps we can proceed.

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where m_f ≤3 GeV. So possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c. Those are the ones with m_f ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but wait: The charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c is about 3 GeV. So 2m_c =3 GeV is equal to M_X=6 GeV. So, decay into c c-bar is allowed, as the mass is exactly half.

So possible decay channels are:

e+ e-,

mu+ mu-,

tau+ tau-,

u u-bar,

d d-bar,

s s-bar,

c c-bar.

But wait, are there any other fermions? What about the neutrinos? But the options don't include them, so probably the problem is considering only charged leptons and quarks.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, the b quark's mass is about 4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So 2m_b would be ~9.4 GeV, which is larger than M_X=6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar. So option A includes b, which isn't allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That includes all the allowed fermions except for the charged leptons and quarks with m_f <=3 GeV. So B includes c, tau, mu, e, s, u, d. That seems correct.

Option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+, tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

No, because t (top quark) is way too heavy (mass ~173 GeV), so 2m_t is 346 GeV, way above 6 GeV. So decay to top is not allowed. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Again, includes b, which is too heavy. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is B. Because all the fermions in B have m_f <=3 GeV, and the decay is allowed.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, the question says the interaction is given by L(y). The Lagrangian must have terms that can create the fermions. Let me think about the structure of the Lagrangian.

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ} f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f, so the vertex is X coupling to two ψ_f fermions.

So the interaction term is of the form X ψ_f ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, provided the mass allows it.

So the allowed decays are all the fermion-antifermion pairs where m_f <=3 GeV.

In the options, option B includes c, which has m_c around 1.5 GeV, so 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is allowed. Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term suggests that \( X \) couples to fermion-antifermion pairs, and the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is allowed if the fermion mass \( m_f \) satisfies \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Identify Fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \)
The known fermion masses are:
- Electron (\( m_e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( m_\mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( m_\tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( m_u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( m_d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( m_s \)): \( \sim 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( m_c \)): \( \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)

Fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) include \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \). The bottom quark (\( m_b \sim 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \)) and top quark (\( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)) are excluded because their masses are too large.

### Step 2: Analyze the Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > M_X \). Hence, A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t > M_X \). Hence, C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > M_X \). Hence, D is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the allowed decay channels for \( X \) based on the given mass constraints.
