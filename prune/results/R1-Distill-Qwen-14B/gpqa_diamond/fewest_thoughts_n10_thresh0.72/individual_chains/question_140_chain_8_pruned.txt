Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. 

Wait, I remember that melting points around that temperature are often associated with water. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, but wait, no, 273 K is 0°C, so 277 K would be about 4°C. Hmm, maybe it's another substance. Alternatively, maybe B is something like glucose or another organic compound? Or perhaps it's something else.

The product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. So, the product is a compound with two O atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. I'm thinking maybe X is something like chromium trioxide (CrO3) or perhaps something else used in oxidation reactions.

Wait, substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps it's an element with a common isotope and an uncommon heavier one. For example, oxygen usually has O-16, but O-18 is heavier. Or maybe something like chlorine with Cl-35 and Cl-37.

Let me think about the reaction between X and Y. Gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. Let's think of possible gases. Maybe NH3? No, because N is 7 protons, H is 1, but that doesn't add up. Or maybe CH4? No. Wait, H2O has H and O. Let me calculate. Water molecule is H2O. Each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So total protons: 2*(1) + 8=10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8 (since O-16 has 8 neutrons). So total neutrons would be 2*0 +8=8. Oh wait, that's not equal. So maybe another gas.

What about CO2? No, because C is 6, O is 8. Wait, maybe another approach. The molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think of a gas where each molecule has protons = total neutrons across all atoms.

Wait, maybe H2O is not. Let's think of another possibility. How about Ozone, O3? Each O has 8 protons. So 3 O is 24 protons. Neutrons: each O-16 has 8, so 3*8=24. So total protons (24) equals total neutrons (24). Oh, that works! So W could be ozone, O3. Or perhaps another molecule.

Wait, but O3 is a gas under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps another molecule like CO. Let's check: each CO molecule has C(6 protons) + O(8 protons) =14. Neutrons
