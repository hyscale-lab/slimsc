Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². Oh wait, radially means it's only in the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, the field has components only along the r-axis. Got it.

The task is to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field within a sphere of radius R. Oh right, the divergence theorem comes into play here. Wait, what's the divergence theorem again? Oh yeah, it relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. Mathematically, it's ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

But wait, I'm not sure if I need to compute the flux here. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the divergence directly and then integrate it. Let's think about it step by step.

The field f(r) is only radial and its magnitude is 1/r². So, in spherical coordinates, the vector field can be written as f = (1/r²) r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector. Because there are no other components (like theta or phi), the other components of the field are zero.

So, to find the divergence in spherical coordinates, I remember the formula for divergence in spherical coords. Oh yeah, the divergence of a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_
