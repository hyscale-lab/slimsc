Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about the decay probability of a single atom after some time has passed without decay.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. So the basic idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed, right? It's a memoryless process. Oh wait, yeah, that's the key point here. So even if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes doesn't change based on that past time. 

Wait, but the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So first, maybe I should figure out the decay constant or the half-life or something from that information. Because I think knowing the decay rate is essential.

The formula I remember for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But since we're talking about probability, maybe that's not the exact formula we need here. Oh, wait, the probability that a nucleus decays in time t is the same as 1 minus the probability it hasn't decayed by time t. So P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). 

Given that P(100) = 32%, which is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). Let me rearrange

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability problem about radioactive decay. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says that we have an atom, which is the result of a beta decay of another atom. We start monitoring it right away. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Hmm, wait. So initially, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. But now, 50 minutes have gone by, and it hasn't decayed. So we're considering the situation after those 50 minutes, and we want to know the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, which would be from 50 to 200 minutes. Or wait, no—because "next 150" could be 150 minutes from the current point, meaning 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total. So the total time since the start would be 200 minutes.

But I'm a bit confused about how radioactive decay probabilities work. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability of decay doesn't depend on the time that has already passed, right? So, if an atom hasn't decayed yet, its probability of decaying in the future depends only on the remaining time.

Wait, let's think more carefully. The decay probability is often modeled with the formula: P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time elapsed. But wait, actually, that's the cumulative probability of having decayed by time t. So, the probability that it decays between time t and t + Δt is given by the decay law.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The survival probability (the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after time t) is given by P_survive(t) = e^(-λt). Therefore, the probability of decaying by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). But this is the cumulative probability. So the decay probability in a given time interval is different.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. Let me get this straight. The
