Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about the decay probability of a single atom after some time has passed without decay.

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. So the basic idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed, right? It's a memoryless process. Oh wait, yeah, that's the key point here. So even if the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes doesn't change based on that past time. 

Wait, but the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So first, maybe I should figure out the decay constant or the half-life or something from that information. Because I think knowing the decay rate is essential.

The formula I remember for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant. But since we're talking about probability, maybe that's not the exact formula we need here. Oh, wait, the probability that a nucleus decays in time t is the same as 1 minus the probability it hasn't decayed by time t. So P(t) = 1 - e^(-位t). 

Given that P(100) = 32%, which is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-位*100). Let me rearrange
