Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and its energy states. Hmm, I remember that electrons transition between energy levels, and when they do, they emit or absorb photons. The question is about a specific transition from the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I think dipole transitions involve changing the angular momentum, so I need to recall the selection rules for that.

Wait, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh right, so the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1. But in the transition from 3s (n=3, l=0) to 1s (n=1, l=0), since the initial and final l are both 0, that's a problem. Because to go from l=0 to l=0 in one step, you can't change l by ±1. So, you can't have a direct transition from 3s to 1s in a single dipole transition. 

So the decay must happen via an intermediate state. That means the electron goes from n=3 to maybe n=2, then from n=2 to n=1. So the first transition is 3s to something with l=1, because l has to change by ±1. Since initially l=0, the first transition must go to an l=1 state. So for the first step, l changes from 0 to 1, which fits Δl=+1. 

What about the possible m values? The initial state has m=0. So after the first transition, the m can change by 0, +1, or -1. So the intermediate state could have m=0, +1, or -1. But then, the second transition has to get from that m to m=0 in the final state. So in the second transition, the change in m should be such that the final m is 0. 

Wait, let's think step by step. The first transition: |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>. So possible m values are m=0, +1, -1. Then, from there, the second transition must go to |1,0,0>. So the second transition must have l going from 1 to 0, which is Δl = -1, which is allowed. And the change in m would be from whatever it was in the intermediate state to 0. So for the second step, the m can change by 0, ±1. 

So let's consider each possibility for the intermediate state.

Case 1: Intermediate state is |2,1,0>. Then, in the second transition, m must go from 0 to 0. So Δm=0, which is allowed. So the path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0>.

Case 2: Intermediate state is |2,1,1>. Then, from m=1, to reach m=0 in the final, Δm is -1, which is allowed. So the path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,1> → |1,0,0>.

Case 3: Intermediate state is |2,1,-1>. Then from m=-1 to 0, Δm=+1, which is allowed. So the path is |3,0,0> → |2,1,-1> → |1,0,0>.

So all three intermediate states are possible. Now, the question is about the transition probability. The options given are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options, Option A shows the first transition to |2,1,0>, and the probability is 1/3. Option B goes to |2,1,1> with 1/4. Option C goes to |2,1,-1> with 1/4. Option D is missing the initial part but from the description, it's similar to A and has
