Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. Oh wait, in a 1D harmonic oscillator, the mass moves back and forth, right? The maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so I can't just use the classical formulas.

In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the maximum speed is when this is converted into kinetic energy, which would be (1/2)mv². So solving for v_max, it would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The question is about the relativistic case, so that can't be the answer here.

Relativistically, the energy isn't just kinetic. The total energy includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. So the energy equation might be different.

So let me recall, the total energy in relativity is E = γmc². And the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². The potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², but in the relativistic case, does the potential energy change? Or is it still F = -kx?

Wait, the problem says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential
