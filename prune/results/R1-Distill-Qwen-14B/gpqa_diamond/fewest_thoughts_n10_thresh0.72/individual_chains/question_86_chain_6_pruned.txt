Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two unknown compounds, A and B. Each was treated with a different reducing agent. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, wait. Looking again, the first reaction gives (R)-4-ethyl..., and the second gives (S)-4-ethyl... So each starting material A and B, when reduced with different agents, gives a product with opposite configurations.

The options give possible starting materials for A and B. All options are different diastereomers or enantiomers of the same compound: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, varying in configuration (R or S).

So, the reaction involves the reduction of a ketone or ester group, perhaps. Wait, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. Let me draw that structure mentally.

The structure is pentanoic acid: five carbons, with a carboxylic acid group on the first. So, numbering from the end with the COOH, it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-OCH(CH2)2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but wait, no: pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-OCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would have the structure:

Carboxylic acid on C1: COOH. Then C2, C3, C4, C5. So, for 5-oxo (a ketone at C5), and 5-isobutoxy (an ether group at C5). Hmm, but that's a bit conflicting because C5 can't have both a ket
