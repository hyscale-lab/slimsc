Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the likelihood of them transiting. I remember that transit probability depends on a few factors. Let's try to think through it step by step.

So the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have same masses, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter. So P1 is closer to its star.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, but if a star is more massive, it's usually larger, but here they have same radii. Hmm, maybe Planet_1's star is more evolved? Or perhaps it's a main-sequence star with higher mass but same radius? Not sure, but the key point is that the host stars have same radii but different masses.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = R_p / a, where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, I think the exact formula is more like (R_p / R_star) squared times something else... No, wait, maybe the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance
