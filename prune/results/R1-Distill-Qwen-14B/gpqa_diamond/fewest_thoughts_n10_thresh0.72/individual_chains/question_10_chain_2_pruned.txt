Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing different exoplanets. I'll go through each one and compare their densities.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So for each planet, I'll need to determine both their mass and volume, then calculate the density.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. I think Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet should have the same density as Earth. So its density is 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's given directly. So this planet's density is 5.5. But wait, how does that hold up with mass? Wait, if the density is already given, then that's the value. So if the planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth, but mass is double. But density is independent of mass, so regardless, this planet's density is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition implies same density, right? Because density depends on the material it's made of. So if it's made of the same stuff as Earth, like similar rock and metal composition, then the density should be the same as Earth, about 5.5. But wait, wait. Because if the mass increases, but the density remains the same, the radius must be larger. Because volume scales with radius cubed, while mass scales with radius cubed as well if density is the same. So for a 5x mass, the radius would be cube root of (5) times Earth's radius. But that's not directly relevant for the question, because the question is about density. So the density here is still 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition, so same density—so 5.5. Because changing the mass without changing the density would require a change in volume. So for half the mass, the radius would be smaller, but the density remains the same.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there any option where the density is higher than Earth's 5.5? Because all the options except maybe
