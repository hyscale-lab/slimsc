Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says there are five exoplanets with orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They're using the TTV method, but I don't think that's super relevant here. The big point is about equilibrium temperatures and their ratios between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that's the temperature a planet would have if it's radiating as a blackbody, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L_star/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / (2) )^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), where a is the semi-major axis. But since all the planets have the same albedo and same star, the albedo term cancels out. So the main factors are the semi-major axis and the star's properties.

But wait, the orbital periods are given in ratios. So for circular orbits, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a via Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So P² is proportional to a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). That's key here.

Since all the planets are around the same star, the star's mass is the same for each, so the relation holds.

So for equilibrium temperature, T is inversely proportional to the square root of a. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Or, wait, let me get the formula right. T = T_eff * ( (R_star / (2a)) )^(1/2) ), but wait, no, that's for flux. Let me think about it again.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2a) ), where T_* is the star's effective temperature, R_* its radius, and a the planet's semi-major axis. So T_p is proportional to sqrt( R_* ) / sqrt( a ). Wait, but in the problem, the planets have the same albedo, so the (1 - albedo) term is the same for all, so they cancel. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of (
