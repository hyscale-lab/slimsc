Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let's go through it step by step.

First, the question describes a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR spectra. Then, it reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

The main focus seems to be on the NOESY spectra of the products. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. I need to figure out which two resonances in the major product's 1H NMR are connected by this cross-peak.

Let me break this down.

1. **Understanding the Starting Material:**
   The starting dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid would typically form an anhydride. The structure might be something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond instead. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond in the chain. Wait, no, actually, for a cis-alkene, it's probably something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it cis.

   When dehydrated, such a structure would form an anhydride. The anhydride would have two carboxylic anhydride groups. But wait, more accurately, a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene on the chain would dehydrate to form a cyclic anhydride, perhaps a five-membered ring. For example, if the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, maybe a five-membered ring with the two oxygen atoms from the carboxylic groups.

   Wait, no. Wait, the starting acid is a diacid with a cis-alkene. So, the structure is probably HOOC-CH2
