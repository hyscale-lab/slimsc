Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. Now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm, wait. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key point here is whether the decay process has memory. I think radioactive decay is a memoryless process, which means the probability of decaying doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So even if 50 minutes have gone by without decay, the probability for the next period should still be based on the original half-life or decay constant.

Wait, but the question gives a probability for 100 minutes. Let me think about that. The decay probability P(t) is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), right? Or wait, no, actually, the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decay probability is 1 minus that.

The given P(100) = 32% = 0.32. So I can write 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So solving for λ.

Let me rearrange that: e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, ln(0.68) is a negative number because 0.68 is less than 1. So when I take the negative, it becomes positive. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, but wait, 0.68 is about 0.68. Let me calculate more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can just keep it as variables for now.

So λ = [ - ln(0.68) ] / 100.

But wait, the question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability should only depend on the time remaining. So the probability after 50 minutes is the same as starting fresh, because whether it decayed before or not doesn't affect the future probabilities. 

Wait, no, because the time passed is 50 minutes, the remaining time to consider is 150 minutes. But wait, no, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150. So the total time from now is 150 minutes. So the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, I think another approach is to consider the conditional probability. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but for memoryless processes, the conditional probability P(decay in next 150 | no decay in 50) is equal to the probability of

Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed for part of that time.

Alright, the problem says that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So, in 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it will decay. But wait, probability in radioactive decay... I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Oh right, the decay constant and all that.

So, the basic idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on the time already elapsed if you're starting fresh. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, in radioactive decay, the probability that a nucleus decays in a given time interval is independent of how much time has already passed. That's the key point here.

Wait, the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So, they want the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean the total time is 200 minutes (50 + 150), or are they asking about the next 150 minutes from the current time? Oh, reading the question again, it says "the next 150 minutes," so that's 150 minutes starting from now.

Wait, but the initial data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, let's parse that. That 32% is the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes from the time it's created. Right.

But, since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, how does that affect the probability? Because radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning it doesn't "remember" how long it's been around. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is the same as any other T-minute interval, regardless of how much time has passed before.

Wait, so if the probability of decaying in the next 100 minutes is 32%, then what is the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes? Or is it that 32% is the cumulative probability over 10
