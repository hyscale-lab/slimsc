Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. Now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm, wait. I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key point here is whether the decay process has memory. I think radioactive decay is a memoryless process, which means the probability of decaying doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So even if 50 minutes have gone by without decay, the probability for the next period should still be based on the original half-life or decay constant.

Wait, but the question gives a probability for 100 minutes. Let me think about that. The decay probability P(t) is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), right? Or wait, no, actually, the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decay probability is 1 minus that.

The given P(100) = 32% = 0.32. So I can write 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So solving for λ.

Let me rearrange that: e^(-λ*100) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, ln(0.68) is a negative number because 0.68 is less than 1. So when I take the negative, it becomes positive. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.4055, but wait, 0.68 is about 0.68. Let me calculate more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can just keep it as variables for now.

So λ = [ - ln(0.68) ] / 100.

But wait, the question is about the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability should only depend on the time remaining. So the probability after 50 minutes is the same as starting fresh, because whether it decayed before or not doesn't affect the future probabilities. 

Wait, no, because the time passed is 50 minutes, the remaining time to consider is 150 minutes. But wait, no, the question is, after 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150. So the total time from now is 150 minutes. So the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

But wait, I think another approach is to consider the conditional probability. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

Wait, but for memoryless processes, the conditional probability P(decay in next 150 | no decay in 50) is equal to the probability of
