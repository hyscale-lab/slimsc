Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So, the question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time, given that it hasn't decayed for part of that time.

Alright, the problem says that the decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So, in 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it will decay. But wait, probability in radioactive decay... I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Oh right, the decay constant and all that.

So, the basic idea is that the probability of decay doesn't depend on the time already elapsed if you're starting fresh. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, in radioactive decay, the probability that a nucleus decays in a given time interval is independent of how much time has already passed. That's the key point here.

Wait, the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So, they want the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean the total time is 200 minutes (50 + 150), or are they asking about the next 150 minutes from the current time? Oh, reading the question again, it says "the next 150 minutes," so that's 150 minutes starting from now.

Wait, but the initial data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, let's parse that. That 32% is the probability that the atom decays within 100 minutes from the time it's created. Right.

But, since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, how does that affect the probability? Because radioactive decay is memoryless, meaning it doesn't "remember" how long it's been around. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is the same as any other T-minute interval, regardless of how much time has passed before.

Wait, so if the probability of decaying in the next 100 minutes is 32%, then what is the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes? Or is it that 32% is the cumulative probability over 10
