Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, okay, let me break it down.

The question has two parts, A and B.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism.

Part B: Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

I need to figure out each part and then match the options.

Starting with Part A. I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bonding electron, usually in compounds with conjugated systems, like carbonyl groups.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups connected by a benzene ring. Wait, no, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? It's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So it's like 1,4-benzoquinone. It's a diketone. Now, can it undergo tautomerism?

Tautomerism usually requires adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups which are conjugated through the aromatic ring. I'm not sure if it can tautomerize. Wait, tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen can shift from one atom to another, leading to a different structure. In the case of quinones, like 1,4-benzoquinone, I think they can tautomerize. For example, they can form enol forms, but since the ring is conjugated, maybe the tautomerism is possible. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, for a compound to show tautomerism, it needs to have a conjugated system with adjacent carbonyl groups. Alternatively, I remember that in the case of quinones, they are generally not tautomerizing because the structure is already in a conjugated,
