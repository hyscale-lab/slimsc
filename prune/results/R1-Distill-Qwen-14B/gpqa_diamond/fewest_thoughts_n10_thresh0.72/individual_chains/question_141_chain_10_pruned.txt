Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I think I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. So let me think about what reaction this setup would likely lead to.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, waitâ€”what's that structure? Oh, benzene with a bromine at position 1 (which is the same as position 6 in some numbering) and a deuterium at position 2? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. Oh right, 1 and 2 would be adjacent on the benzene ring. So the bromine is on position 1, and the adjacent position (position 2) has a deuterium. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so maybe the numbering doesn't matter as much in this context, but I'll have to keep that in mind.

So when you have a bromide on a benzene ring and you treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, what's the typical reaction? I think it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a benzyne intermediate. Benzyne is a benzene ring with a triple bond, right? So that's an aryne.

The formation of benzyne usually involves the elimination of HX (in this case, HBr, but since one of the hydrogens is deuterium, that might change things a
