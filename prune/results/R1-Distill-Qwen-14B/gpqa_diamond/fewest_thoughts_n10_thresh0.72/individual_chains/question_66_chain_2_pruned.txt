Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc. But the key here is about the symmetries they must respect.

Lorentz symmetry â€“ that's the symmetry of special relativity, right? So all terms in the Lagrangian must respect Lorentz invariance. Because the theory is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory, all operators must transform correctly under Lorentz transformations. So yeah, Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must-respect symmetry for all operators. So 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group. But wait, in effective field theories, do operators have to respect Poincare symmetry? I think they do because EFTs are still built respecting local symmetries of the Standard Model. Or wait, maybe not. Because Poincare is more about the whole spacetime symmetry, including momentum conservation. But all terms in the Lagrangian should be local, so that would include Poincare. Oh wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they must respect Poincare symmetry. So does that mean both Lorentz and Poincare are required? Because Poincare includes Lorentz, but the question lists them as separate options. Hmm.

Wait, but the options have 1 and 2 as possible. So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected, perhaps both 1 and 2 are correct. Because an operator that doesn't respect Poincare would not be a valid part of the theory. So 1 and 2 must both be correct. So that narrows down the options. Looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, option C is 1,2,4. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe Poincare is automatically respected if the theory is Lorentz-invariant because EFTs are built respecting Poincare. So perhaps all operators in SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry, so 2 is also a must. So 1 and 2 would both be true.

Now, what about 3, CP symmetry. Wait, I think SMEFT allows for operators that break CP. Because SMEFT includes terms that can have higher-dimension operators which might violate CP, such as in the case of certain beyond the Standard Model theories. For example, the SM already has some CP violation, but SMEFT can include operators that further break it. So operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So 3 is not a must-respect symmetry; therefore, any option including 3 is incorrect.

Similarly, 4 is CPT symmetry. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and has a unitary S-matrix. Because SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant
