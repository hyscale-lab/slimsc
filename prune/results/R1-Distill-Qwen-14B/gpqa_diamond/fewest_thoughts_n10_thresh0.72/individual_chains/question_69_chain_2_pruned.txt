Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy of the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime because of time dilation. Oh right, that's special relativity. The formula for the dilated lifetime is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So first, I need to find γ. The Lorentz factor γ is given by E/(m c²), since for a relativistic particle, E is the total energy. Oh wait, but wait—since E is given in GeV and mass is also in GeV/c², I think it's just E = γ m c², so γ is E/(m c²) but since both are in the same units (GeV), perhaps I can ignore the c² because it's already accounted for. Or maybe not, but for the sake of units, perhaps it's okay since the mass is given in GeV and energy is also GeV. So in this case, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV/c². Wait, no, because E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c². So actually, E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But since E is given as 27 GeV, which is energy, and m is 3.41 GeV/c². So if I write E = γ m c², then γ = E/(m c²). But wait, E is in GeV, m c² is in GeV (since m is GeV/c² multiplied by c² gives GeV). So E/(m c²) would be (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ≈ 27 /3.41 ≈ around 7.918. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by
