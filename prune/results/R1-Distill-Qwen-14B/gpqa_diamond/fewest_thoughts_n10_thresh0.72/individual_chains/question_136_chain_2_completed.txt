Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it. So the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. 

Wait, right, divergence. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a point. For a vector field that depends only on the radial direction, there's probably a simpler way to compute the divergence than using the full tensor formula.

So the field is radial. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial (only fr component) is given by the derivative of (r² fr) divided by r². Because the other components (like theta and phi) are zero, their derivatives won't contribute. 

The magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r². Since it's only radial, I think fr is 1/r². So plugging into the divergence formula: 

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² fr) 

Let me compute that. Substituting fr = 1/r²:

d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = d/dr (1) = 0. 

Wait, so the divergence is zero? But wait, wait a minute. If the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, then the integral over the volume would be zero. But wait, another thought: when r is zero, the field isn't defined because 1/r² blows up. So perhaps there's a delta function or something at the origin. 

Wait, but the divergence we calculated is zero except perhaps at r=0. So when you integrate the divergence over the volume of the sphere, you might get a different result. But wait, the divergence is zero everywhere except at a single point, so the integral over the volume should be zero, right? Because the integral of zero over a volume is zero. But wait, wait, maybe I'm missing a point here. 

Wait, let me think again. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then when I integrate it over the entire volume, the integral would be zero. But wait, no, the divergence isn't actually zero. Because when I have a vector field that's the gradient of a scalar potential, then the divergence is the laplacian of the scalar. Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. 

Wait, actually, the vector field f(r) is radial and has magnitude 1/r². So could this be similar to an electric field? Like, maybe it's analogous to Coulomb's law. Wait, Coulomb's law is E = k q r̂ / r². The divergence of such a field is known to be zero except at the origin. 

Wait, but wait, let me compute the divergence properly. If f(r) is radial, so f = (1/r²) r̂. So in spherical coordinates, the divergence is:

∇·f = (1/(r² sinθ)) ∂/∂θ (fθ sinθ) + (1/(r²)) ∂/∂r (r² fr) + other terms for phi? Wait, no, because fθ and fφ are zero. So the divergence is only the first term for the angular parts, but since fθ and fφ are zero, their derivatives are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² fr). 

So substituting fr = (1/r²), r² fr is r² * (1/r²) = 1. So taking derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = 0 for all r not equal to zero.

But wait, then the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere would be zero, right? Because divergence is zero except at a point which has measure zero in integration. So the integral would be zero, so the answer should be D) 0. 

But wait, another thought: wait, does this field have a source at the origin? Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the divergence theorem would say that the flux through the surface is equal to the integral of divergence over the volume. So if the divergence is zero except at the origin, perhaps the flux is a delta function at the origin.

Wait, but in our case, we're computing the integral of the divergence inside the sphere. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, the integral would be zero. Because the origin is just a single point, which has no volume. So the integral would be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute this via the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem states that the integral of the divergence of f over a volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of that volume. So if I compute the flux through the surface of the sphere radius R, I can find the volume integral.

So the flux Φ is the integral of f · dA over the sphere surface. Since f is radial, the dot product simplifies. f(r) on the sphere is 1/R², and dA is the area element which is also radial. So the dot product is (1/R²) * (R² sinθ dθ dφ), because the area vector points radially outward, so the dot product is f(r) * R² sinθ dθ dφ over the sphere.

Wait, no, wait: the flux is ∫ f · n̂ dA, where n̂ is the outward normal, which is the same as the radial unit vector r̂. So the dot product is f(r) * (r̂ · r̂) = f(r). So f(r) on the surface is (1/R²) r̂. So the flux is ∫ (1/R²) r̂ · r̂ dA. But since r̂ · r̂ is 1, the flux is (1/R²) * ∫ dA over the sphere. The surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so the flux is (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to this flux, 4π. But wait, that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion that ∇·f is zero. So what's going on here?

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because if the flux is 4π, then the volume integral of ∇·f must be 4π. But wait, how? Because earlier I thought ∇·f was zero everywhere except at r=0. So perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a delta function.

So in reality, the divergence of f is zero for r not equal to zero, but at r=0, it's a delta function such that the integral over the volume gives 4π. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume is 4π. Therefore, the volume integral is 4π, which is option A.

Wait, but then the problem statement says that the field has non-zero components only along the radial direction and falls off as 1/r². So the vector field is similar to the Coulomb field, which has a divergence that's zero except at the origin, where it's a delta function.

So the flux through the surface of the sphere is 4π, which equals the integral of the divergence over the volume. Therefore, the correct answer should be 4π, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the divergence, I found it to be zero. So where's the mistake here? Oh, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the divergence. Let me check that again.

Compute ∇·f for f = (1/r²) r̂.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field F = F_r r̂ + F_θ θ̂ + F_φ φ̂ is:

∇·F = (1/r²) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(F_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ/∂φ.

In our case, F_θ = F_φ = 0, so the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

Substituting F_r = 1/r²:

(1/r²) d/dr (r² * 1/r²) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So the divergence is indeed zero everywhere except at r=0. But then the divergence theorem says the integral of this (which is zero) over the volume should equal the flux, which is 4π. That doesn't make sense. Unless the divergence is not just zero but includes a delta function at the origin.

Ah, right! Because the field is singular at the origin, the divergence is actually a delta function scaled by 4π. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r) in three dimensions. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume of the sphere would be 4π times the integral of δ³(r) over the volume, which is 4π * 1 = 4π.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the field is given as 1/r², which is the Coulomb potential-like field. So the divergence would be 4π δ³(r). So the integral over any volume containing the origin would be 4π.

So putting it all together, the volume integral of ∇·f inside the sphere of radius R is 4π. So the answer should be option A) 4 π.

So the correct answer is A.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \), we start by analyzing the given field. The vector field is purely radial, with a magnitude \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), and it falls off as \( 1/r^2 \). 

### Step 1: Compute the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \)
In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} = F_r \hat{r} + F_\theta \hat{\theta} + F_\phi \hat{\phi} \) is given by:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 F_r \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left( F_\theta \sin\theta \right) + \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} \frac{\partial F_\phi}{\partial \phi}.
\]
Since the field has only a radial component (\( F_\theta = F_\phi = 0 \)), the divergence simplifies to:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 F_r \right).
\]
Substituting \( F_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we compute:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (1) = 0.
\]
Thus, the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field is singular.

### Step 2: Integral of the divergence over the volume
The divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it behaves like a Dirac delta function \( \delta^3(r) \). For a vector field that falls off as \( 1/r^2 \), the divergence can be expressed as:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r).
\]
The integral of the divergence over the volume of the sphere is then:
\[
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = \int_V 4\pi \delta^3(r) \, dV.
\]
The delta function \( \delta^3(r) \) is nonzero only at \( r = 0 \), and its integral over any volume containing the origin is 1. Therefore:
\[
\int_V 4\pi \delta^3(r) \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 3: Verification using the divergence theorem
The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the field through the surface of the sphere:
\[
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dA,
\]
where \( \mathbf{\hat{n}} \) is the outward unit normal vector to the surface. On the surface of the sphere (\( r = R \)), the field is \( \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{R^2} \hat{r} \), and the flux is:
\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} \, dA = \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA.
\]
The surface area of the sphere is \( 4\pi R^2 \), so:
\[
\int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
\]
This confirms that the volume integral of the divergence is indeed \( 4\pi \).

### Final Answer
The volume integral of the divergence of the field inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \).
