Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ · n. Here, n is an arbitrary unit vector, ε is a constant with energy dimension, and σ are the Pauli spin matrices. The options are about the eigenvalues of H.

Hmm. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, right? Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, where n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, the Hamiltonian is a dot product of σ and n, scaled by ε. So H = ε (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z). But since n is a unit vector, the direction doesn't affect the eigenvalues, right? Because rotating the system shouldn't change the energy levels, just their orientation.

I think for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and when you take the dot product, the maximum eigenvalue would be the magnitude of n (which is 1) times the magnitude of σ, which is also 1. So the eigenvalues of σ · n must be ±1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination, does that hold? For example, σ · n is a matrix, and its eigenvalues are found by solving det(H - λ I)=0.

Alternatively, I remember that any Pauli matrix σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, and the trace is zero. The eigenvalues of a sum of Pauli matrices would depend on their combination, but when it's a normalized vector multiplied by them, it should just scale.

Wait, no, the eigenvalues would be the component in the direction of n. Because the dot product σ · n is like projecting the spin in the direction of n. So for a spin-½ particle, the possible eigenvalues are ± ħ/2 times the component, but wait, in terms of the Pauli matrices, I think the eigenvalues are ±1 multiplied by something.

Wait
