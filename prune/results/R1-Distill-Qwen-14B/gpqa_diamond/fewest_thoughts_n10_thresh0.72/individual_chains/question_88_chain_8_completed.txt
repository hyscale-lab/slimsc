Okay, so I'm looking at this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to unpack what's going on here. 

First, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, they used in vivo imaging and saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, others got stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. But they did find fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. They sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Wait, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. So when the rotavirus capsid proteins are delivered via oral gavage, some of them probably get taken up by these Peyer patches. 

The fact that some GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid suggests that the proteins didn't survive digestion. But some might have made it through, maybe because they were protected somehow. Oh, right, rotavirus is an enteric virus, so it's adapted to survive the gut environment to some extent. But in this case, they're using tagged proteins, so maybe some get degraded while others are taken up by the immune system.

The next part says that the fluorescent Peyer patches were identified. So the GFP must have been taken up by antigen-presenting cells in the Peyer patches. Then they isolated the proliferating cells. Proliferating in lymphoid tissuesâ€”those are likely B cells, since they're involved in immune response and proliferation is a part of their activation and differentiation.

When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, they saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that some process is causing diversification of the B cell receptors. I remember that during immune responses, B cells undergo several processes that change their receptor genes.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs in activated B cells, especially during the germinal center reactions. It introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, leading to diversification and affinity maturation.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, leading to opsonization or lysis of pathogens. But I don't think it directly causes variability in the B cell receptors.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when the class of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. It's a process where the heavy chain isotype is switched, but it doesn't change the variable regions. So the variable heavy chain sequence would remain the same, just the class changes.

D) VDJ recombination: That's the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are rearranged to form the variable region of the heavy chain. But this happens during the initial stages of B cell development, not in response to a specific antigen. So if the variable regions are already diverse due to VDJ, why would there be high variability after the immune response?

Wait, but the question says high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after the B cells have been activated and isolated. So VDJ occurs early, during B cell maturation. Somatic hypermutation occurs later, during the immune response, leading to further diversification. So if they're seeing high variability after the immune response, that points to somatic hypermutation.

So the process here is likely somatic hypermutation (option A). Because when B cells are activated, they undergo this process in the germinal centers, leading to diverse V regions. That's why the variable heavy chains have high variability.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are observed to interact with the immune system, with some being degraded by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus. However, fluorescent Peyer patches are identified, indicating that some proteins were taken up by the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Peyer patches are specialized for antigen sampling and contain antigen-presenting cells that can activate B cells. The isolated proliferating cells from the Peyer patches show high variability in their variable heavy chain genes upon sequencing.

High variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that diversifies B cell receptors. Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, introducing point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, leading to diversification and affinity maturation. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly cause variability in B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are rearranged. However, this process does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes after the immune response.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response in germinal centers, leading to further diversification of B cell receptors.
