Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. It typically occurs under heat or light, and it's used to form more complex structures. 

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me look at each part separately.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. I think that's a benzene ring with a substituent. Let me draw the structure. So, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy attached to a methyl group. Wait, no, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl? Or is it the benzene with a ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl group? Oh wait, the structure is ( (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy ) methyl group attached to benzene. So benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. Let me break it down:

The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. But that's connected to a methyl group? Or is the substituent OCH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy connected to a methyl, meaning that the benzene has a OCH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-? Hmm, maybe I should write the structure properly.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, but but is four carbons. So 1,2,3,4: the double bond is between 2 and 3. So the structure would be CH2
