Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, I need to think through each star's properties and see if they fit the criteria for both instruments.

First, I should remember the key points from the question. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that means any star with V < 17, because brighter means lower magnitude. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so V < 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude less than 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So the strictest condition is V <16, because if it's less than 16, it's automatically less than 17. So the star's apparent V must be less than 16.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V brighter than 17 (so apparent V ≤17). And HIRES can observe stars with V ≤16. So for a star to be observable by both, it must have apparent V ≤16, because HIRES can't see beyond 16. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16 for both.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of what each instrument can see. So, for a star to be observed by both, it must be observable by ESPRESSO (apparent V ≤17) and observable by HIRES (apparent V ≤16). So the star's apparent V must be ≤16, because if it's 16.5, it's not observable by HIRES.

Now, let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent V is absolute magnitude plus distance modulus. Distance modulus is 5 log10 (d/10) = 5*(1) =5. So apparent V =15.5 +5=20.5. That's way above 17, so ESPRESSO can't see it. So Star1 is out.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. Wait, the question says for HIRES, V must be brighter than 16.5 is 16.5, which is not brighter than 16. So HIRES can't observe it because it's 16.5, which is above 16. So Star2 can be detected only by ESPRESSO (since 16.5 ≤17), but not by HIRES. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5 mag, but wait, no. Wait, the data for
