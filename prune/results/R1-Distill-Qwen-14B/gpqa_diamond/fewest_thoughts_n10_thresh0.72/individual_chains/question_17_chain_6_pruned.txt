Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again.

The question says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temp is 25 degrees C, and the formation constant K is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex is Ca-EDTA in this case. So, the solution has the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. I think the formula for the formation constant might relate the concentrations of Ca, EDTA, and the complex.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form CaEDTA^2-. So the equation would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. The question is asking for the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Right.

I think I need to set up an expression for K. Let me think. So in solution, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. But since EDTA is a hexad
