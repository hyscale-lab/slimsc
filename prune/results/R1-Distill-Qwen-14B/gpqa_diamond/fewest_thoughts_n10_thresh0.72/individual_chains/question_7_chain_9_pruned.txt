Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by the process γγ → e+e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the range of 1e4 to 3.9e5 GeV. 

Wait, I remember something about photon-photon interactions and pair production. For high-energy gamma rays, they can annihilate with CMB photons to produce electrons and positrons. This process affects how long these gamma rays can exist in the universe — their lifetime is limited because the interaction probability is high enough that they don't survive for the age of the universe.

So, the lifetime limit comes from the probability of this interaction. The mean lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction probability. The probability depends on the cross-section and the number density of the target photons (CMB in this case).

The cross-section for the process γγ → e+e- has a certain dependence on the energy. I think for this process, the cross-section is proportional to σ ~ (s)^{-1/2}, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Alternatively, perhaps when the center-of-mass energy is much larger than the electron mass, the cross-section can be approximated differently. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dependence. Let me think.

The threshold for pair production requires that the center-of-mass energy of the two photons be at least twice the electron rest mass (since each photon must provide at least 2m_e c², but wait, no— the combined energy must be at least 2m_e c². So the condition is sqrt(s) ≥ 2m_e c². But in this case, the CMB photons are of low energy, so for high-energy gamma rays, the CMB photons are much lower energy. So the gamma-ray energy E must be such that when it interacts with a CMB photon of energy ε (~1e-3 eV), their combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is sufficient for pair production.

Wait, but how does the cross-section depend on the energy? I recall that the cross-section for photon-photon pair production peaks when the center-of-mass energy is just around the electron mass (since that's the threshold). But for high-energy photons, the cross-section might be approximated using the Thomson cross-section multiplied by some factor involving the energies. Or perhaps the cross-section is proportional to σ ~ (E_γ * ε)^{-1} or something like that. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that the optical depth τ for this process is given by τ = n_γ * σ * L, where n_γ is the number density of CMB photons, and L is the distance over which the gamma-ray travels. The optical depth τ is the probability that the gamma-ray will annihilate. If τ ≈ 1, then the gamma-rays are effectively absorbed on average.

The condition for the lifetime to be limited is that the proper lifetime of the gamma-ray multiplied by the Hubble parameter (which gives the expansion rate and the age of the universe) is approximately equal to the inverse of the
