Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see, I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones and esters. NaBH4 is a milder one, which I think can reduce ketones but not esters. 

The question has two reactions. Let me break them down.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. So, the starting material is an ketone with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon. LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones. So, the ketone (at C3) will get reduced to an alcohol. Wait, actually, when a ketone is reduced, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes an alcohol (CH2OH or similar). So, hexan-3-one would become hexan-3-ol. But wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-OH? No, wait. No, wait. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH2CO... Let me draw it. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH3, but wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3? Hmm, maybe I should write the structure properly.

The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the carbonyl is at position 3. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, hexan has six carbons. So, numbering from the left: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6. So, 3 is the carbonyl. So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6: the carbonyl is at 3. Then, the 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So, the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3?

Wait, that's actually six carbons. Let's see
