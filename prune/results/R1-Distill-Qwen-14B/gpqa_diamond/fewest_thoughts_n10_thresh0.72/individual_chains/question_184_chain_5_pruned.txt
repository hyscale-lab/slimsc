Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait, numbering might be tricky here. Let me get the structure right. The numbering starts such that the ethoxy group is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, which means they are meta to each other in some way, but maybe more accurately, it's 1,2,3-trisubstituted.

Wait, benzene can't have three substituents in adjacent positions without some steric issues, but assuming the synthesis is possible, let's think about how to add these groups.

Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. The substituents can be added in a specific order, considering the directing effects of each group.

The groups present are: tert-butyl (which is a bulky alkyl group, so it's ortho/para directing), nitro (a strong meta director), and ethoxy (OCH2CH3, which is an activating, ortho/para directing group because it's an ether).

Wait, but wait: nitro is a deactivating group, so it's meta directing. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para. Tert-butyl is activating but bulky, so it's ortho/para but maybe less so because of steric hindrance. 

So, the plan is to add these groups in an order that allows each new group to direct the next substitution correctly.

Let me think about the possible order of adding these substituents. The target molecule has three substituents, so we need three substitution reactions.

One common approach is to add the groups in such a way that each new group is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But wait, the substituents are a
