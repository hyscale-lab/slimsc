Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the final product's NMR spectrum. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, let me understand the reaction steps. The problem describes a series of reactions starting with acetic acid and ending with product 4. My goal is to figure out the structure of product 4 and then determine its NMR signals.

Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with bromine in the presence of a base like pyridine, it's likely an acetylation reaction. Oh wait, acetic anhydride is a good acetylating agent. So maybe this is a Friedel-Crafts acetylation. But wait, acetic acid isn't aromatic. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's a bromination. Oh, wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming an acetylated compound. Wait, maybe it's adding an acetyl group. Oh, wait, acetic acid has an -OH group. If I treat it with acetic anhydride and a base like pyridine, that's an acetylation of the -OH. So product 1 would be acetate ester, like acetylated acetic acid. So acetic acid (CH3COOH) would become CH3CO-OAc (Ac is acetyl). Wait, no, wait. Acetic anhydride is (AcO)2O. So when you acetylate an -OH group, you get an ester. So if acetic acid (HOAc) is treated with acetic anhydride in presence of a base, it would form acetic anhydride's ester. Wait, maybe it's forming an acetyl bromide? Or perhaps it's a bromination.

Wait, another thought: bromine in pyridine could be a bromination. But acetic acid has an -OH group. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution. Acetic acid has a CH3COOH group. When treated with bromine and pyridine, perhaps the -OH is replaced by Br. So acetic acid would become CH3COBr, which is acetyl bromide. Because pyridine can act as a base, absorbing HBr as it's formed.

But then
