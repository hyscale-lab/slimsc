Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region varies with distance, given a specific relation involving parallax. Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

Alright, the question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that's N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. I think the symbol plx here stands for parallax. Parallax is usually denoted by the symbol π, but maybe they're using plx here for clarity.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Right, the formula I remember is distance d equals 1 over parallax π, but in parsecs. So, d = 1/π. That means π is inversely proportional to d. So when d increases, π decreases.

The problem is asking about how the number of stars N changes with distance r. So I need to express N in terms of r, not π. Let's see. Since π is 1/d, and d is the distance, then π = 1/r, assuming r is in parsecs. Wait, no, I think parallax is in arcseconds, and distance in parsecs. So, d (in parsecs) = 1/π (in arcseconds). So π = 1/d.

Wait, let me get that straight. If a star is at distance d parsecs, its parallax is π = 1/d arcseconds. So π is inversely proportional to d. So π = k / d, where k is a constant. But since we're talking about proportionality, the constant won't matter much here.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/π^5. Let's substitute π with 1/d. Because π = 1/d, so substituting that into the equation:

N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5.

Hmm, let's compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so the reciprocal is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So, if N is proportional to d^5, does that mean that as r (
