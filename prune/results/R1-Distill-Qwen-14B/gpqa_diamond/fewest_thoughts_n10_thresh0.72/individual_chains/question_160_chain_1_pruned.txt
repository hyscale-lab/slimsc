Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

So the question says the aperture is a N-sided polygon, right? And all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Apothem... wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if all apothems are the same, that means each side is the same length too, making it a regular polygon. Oh, and N is going to be infinitely large, so effectively, it's a circle. Because as N approaches infinity, a regular polygon becomes a circle. Oh, that's a key point.

The light is monochromatic, wavelength lambda, and it's coming along the z-axis, hitting the aperture vertically. So this is a Fraunhofer diffraction setup. Fraunhofer is far field, so we can use the Fourier transform approach, or more specifically, the formula for single-slit diffraction because when N is large, the polygon approximates a circular aperture.

Wait a second, but wait. If the aperture is a regular N-gon, as N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle. So the problem is about a circular aperture. But wait, the options don't have the usual single-slit pattern. Wait, no, wait, wait. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture (like a pinhole) is different from a single slit. Oh, but the question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait again. Wait, no, the question says it's a N-sided polygon. But when N is infinitely large, it's a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be the same as a circular aperture. But in that case, the minima in the diffraction pattern occur at certain angles.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because for a single slit, the minima are at sin(theta) = n lambda / d, where d is the slit width, and n is an integer. But for a circular aperture (like a pinhole), the minima are given by something else. Oh right, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at theta where sin(theta) = 1.22 lambda / D, where D is the diameter. Oh wait, but that's the first minimum, but the question is about the first two minima, so maybe the second minimum is at a higher angle.

Wait, but wait, the question is
