Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the major products of two reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong base, so it's probably an elimination or maybe a substitution reaction. Wait, but cyclohexanone derivatives... Oh, right! This looks like a case for the Claisen condensation. Because, when a ketone reacts with an enolate, it can undergo a conjugate addition.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone. And the other reagent is ethyl acrylate, which is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So t-BuOK would deprotonate the alpha position of the ketone to form an enolate. Then, the enolate would attack the electrophilic beta carbon of the acrylate in a conjugate addition. That usually forms a new carbon-carbon bond.

But wait, the structure of the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Oh wait, 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl? Wait the numbering might be a bit tricky. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 1 is the carbonyl. Position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl. Position 6 has a methyl. So the ring looks like: position 1 is C=O, position 2 has CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl) and a CH3, and position 6 has a CH3.

So when t-BuOK is added, it will abstract an alpha proton to form an enolate. The alpha positions are adjacent to the carbonyl. So in this case, the carbonyl is at position 1. The adjacent carbons are positions 2 and 6, right? Because cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the ketone
