Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Let's see, I need to figure out which statement is correct. The options are A, B, C, D. I'll go through each option one by one, checking the conditions.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator is unitary, and quantum states are represented by unit vectors (so their norm is 1). Also, the exponential of an anti-Hermitian matrix is unitary. Hmm.

Looking at the matrices:

W is given as:
Row 1: 0, 0, 1
Row 2: 0, 1, 0
Row 3: 1, 0, 0
So W is a permutation matrix. Let me check if it's Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it should equal its conjugate transpose. W is real, so its conjugate transpose is its transpose. Transposing W would give rows as columns. So row 1 becomes column 1: 0, 0, 1; row2: 0,1,0; row3:1,0,0. Wait, that's the same as W. So W is symmetric, so W is Hermitian. Wait no, W is equal to its transpose, so W = W^T, which for real matrices implies symmetric, so yes, W is Hermitian.

Then, X is:
i, -1, 2i
1, 0, 1
2i, -1, -i
I should check if X is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of X would have elements where each element (i,j) is the complex conjugate of (j,i). Let's compute that. The (1,1) element is i, so the (1,1) in conjugate transpose is -i. For (1,2) in X is -1, so (2,1) in X* should be -1^* which is -1. Wait, but in X, (2,1) is 1, so X^dagger (conjugate transpose) at (2,1) is 1. So comparing with X's (1,2) is -1. So for X to be Hermitian, X should equal X^dagger. Let's check each element:

X^dagger would be:

Row 1: i*, 1*, (2i)* → -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: (-1)*, 0*, 1* → -1, 0, 1
Row 3: (2i)*, (-1)*, (-i)* → -2i, -1, i

Wait, X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So X^dagger is:

Row 1: -
