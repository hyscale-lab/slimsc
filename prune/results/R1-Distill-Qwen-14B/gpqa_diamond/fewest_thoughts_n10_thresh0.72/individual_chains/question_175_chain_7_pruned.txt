Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated at a specific angle and the functional form of the power distribution.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the axis along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. That makes me think about dipole radiation because a dipole is a common source of radiation, and it has that kind of symmetry.

I remember that in dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle depends on the angle theta. Oh right! The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at the equator, which is 90 degrees from the z-axis. So the power should vary with theta. Let me think about the formula for the power distribution.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is given by the function f, which is a function of lambda and theta. The question says that the maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees.

I recall that the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to (sin theta)^2, but wait, no, wait. Dipole radiation has a pattern that peaks at 90 degrees. The formula for the power in the far field (radiation zone) is P(theta) proportional to (sin^2 theta) multiplied by some factors involving the frequency or wavelength.

Wait, wait, more precisely, the power per unit solid angle (like the radiation intensity) for a dipole is given by something like (p^2 omega^4)/(c^3 epsilon_0) * (sin^2 theta)/(4 pi), where p is the dipole moment. So the maximum occurs when sin theta is 1, which is theta = 90 degrees.

So at theta = 30 degrees, sin theta is 0.5. So the power at 30 degrees would be (0.5)^2 = 0.25 times the maximum power, which is A. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is the maximum at 90 degrees indeed? Because another thought: the total power is the integral of the power over all solid angles. So if the maximum per unit solid angle is at a certain point, but
