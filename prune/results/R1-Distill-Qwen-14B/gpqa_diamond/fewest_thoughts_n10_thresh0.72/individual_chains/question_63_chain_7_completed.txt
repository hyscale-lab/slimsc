Okay, so I have this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I need to find the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Let me think about the concepts involved here.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So I guess the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whether this is for rotation, vibration, or both. The model is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think includes both rotation and vibration.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and given by some formula. Oh right, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be described by the rotation and vibration parts combined. But wait, the problem says non-rigid rotor model. Wait, non-rigid rotor... Oh, I think that's the same as the rigid rotor model but with the bond length not fixed, so they consider the centrifugal distortion. But maybe that's more complicated, but perhaps for this problem, it's just the rigid rotor being considered.

Wait, maybe the question is about a photon causing a transition. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule's energy increases, causing a transition to a higher state. But what's the lowest possible next energy state? I think the molecule can either change its vibrational state or rotational state. Since the fundamental state is the lowest, perhaps the next state would involve increasing either the vibrational quantum number or the rotational quantum number.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. The next state with the lowest possible energy compared to which states? Because energy states can be from rotation or vibration. Hmmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the molecule moving to the next higher energy state, which would be the first excited state, which would be the next in the energy ordering. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. So the photon's energy is absorbed, which causes the molecule to transition to a higher energy state. The energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the current state and the next state.

So first, I need to find the energy difference between the initial state (fundamental) and the next possible state. Then, relate that energy difference to the photon's energy, and from there find the momentum.

But wait, the initial state is the fundamental state. For a diatomic molecule in the quantum model, the energy has both rotation and vibration components. The fundamental state is typically the first vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (which depends on the symmetry of the molecule, but I think for rotation, the lowest state is when the rotational quantum number J is 0 or 1, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that).

Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational constant B is given by h/(8π² μ R² c), but wait, I might have that wrong. Alternatively, B = ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. Yes, that's right. I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). So given Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu, the total mass is 22 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. But I should keep it exact for calculation.

Wait, but the question gives R as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R = 2e-10 m. So I = μ R².

Let me compute the reduced mass μ:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu. Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = (20/11) * 1.66e-27 kg. Let me compute that:

20/11 ≈ 1.818, so 1.818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ (1.818 * 1.66) ≈ 3.01e-27 kg. Let me keep more precise numbers for now.

So I = μ R² = (20/11 * 1.66e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Squared is 4e-20 m².

So I = μ * 4e-20.

Wait, I think B is given by ħ²/(2 I). So let's compute B.

But also, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I by B = ħ²/(2 I). Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of energy, but the exact formula is a bit unclear in my mind. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2 I). So yes, that's correct.

But wait, the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. For the fundamental state, the vibrational quantum number v is 0, and the rotational quantum number J is 0 (since that's the lowest state for rotation). So the initial state is v=0, J=0.

The next possible state with the lowest energy would be either increasing J to 1 (since J can't be lower than 0), or increasing v to 1 (v=1). But which transition requires less energy?

Because for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational energy levels are spaced more closely than the rotational ones. Wait, no, actually, the spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than rotational, because w (angular frequency) for vibrations is higher. For example, w_vib is about 1e13 to 1e14 rad/s, while the rotational constants B are about 1e-4 to 1e-3 cm^-1, which translates to lower energy differences per step.

Wait, no, let me think again. The energy difference between rotational levels is E_rot = B [ J (J+1) - J0 (J0+1) ].

For J=0 → J=1, the energy difference is B [1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)] = 2B.

The vibrational energy difference from v=0 to v=1 is h w. So which is larger, 2B or h w?

Given that w is given as 4e14 rad/s. So let's compute h w: Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now compute 2B. Need to find B.

B = ħ²/(2 I). ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

I = μ R².

μ is (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) amu = (40)/(22) = 20/11 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m. So R² = 4e-20 m².

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg·m².

So B = ħ²/(2 I) = (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (2 * 1.204e-46 kg·m²).

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Denominator: 2 * 1.204e-46 = 2.408e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 ≈ approximately 4.62e-23 J.

Wait, 1e-68 / 1e-46 is 1e-22, but let's compute it more accurately.

1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 2.408) * 1e(-68 +46) ) → 0.461 * 1e-22 → 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

Now compare to the vibrational energy difference, which is h w = 2.65e-19 J. That's way bigger than 9.22e-23 J.

So the energy required for a rotational transition (J=0→1) is much less than the vibrational transition (v=0→1). Therefore, the molecule would more likely first undergo a rotational transition when absorbing a photon with the energy corresponding to 2B.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state and the next state, which in this case would be the rotational transition, since it requires less energy.

Wait, but wait, am I sure that the next state in energy is a rotation transition rather than a vibration? Because in terms of energy, the first vibrational state is much higher than the first rotational state.

Because the energy spacing between vibrational levels is much larger. So the energy needed for rotation is much smaller. So the molecule can make a transition with lower energy, so the photon's energy would be 2B, and the question is to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, but photons have energy E = p c, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light. Or wait, E = h f, and since f = c / λ, but p = h / λ, so E = p c. So E = p c → p = E / c.

So if the energy of the photon is E_photon = 2B, then p_photon = E_photon / c = (2B) / c.

So let me compute that.

We have B ≈ 4.61e-23 J. So 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = (9.22 / 3) * 1e-31 → 3.073e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are that small. The options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s.

Wait, because 1 N·s is equal to 1 kg·m/s. So the options are in 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg·m/s.

But my calculation gives about 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is way smaller than the options.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, maybe I messed up the energy difference. Because the initial state is the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next possible state with the lowest energy might be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. But whether it's J changing or v changing depends on which requires less energy.

As I calculated, E_rot for J=1 is 2B, which is about 9e-23 J, and E_vib for v=1 is about 2.6e-19 J. So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So the photon would need to have energy 2B.

But in that case, the photon's momentum would be E_photon / c = 2B / c ≈ 9.22e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is way beyond the options given.

So perhaps I'm making a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of B.

B = ħ² / (2I)

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 40 / 22 * 1.6605e-27 = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m. So R squared is 4e-20 m².

I = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.204e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.204e-46) ) → 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 ≈ 4.62e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.24e-23 J.

Hmm, seems correct. Then the photon's energy is 9.24e-23 J.

p = E / c = 9.24e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.08e-31 kg·m/s.

But this doesn't match any of the options. The options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 kg·m/s (since 1 N·s is 1 kg·m/s).

Wait a minute. Did I make a unit mistake? Because R is given in angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. But perhaps I should have converted it to centimeters? Because sometimes rotational constants are expressed in cm^-1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The moment of inertia is in kg·m², so R should be in meters. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require a photon with energy h w.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that h w is much larger than the rotational transition. So the energy would be h w.

But let's compute that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s, w is 4e14 rad/s. So E = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then the momentum p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is lower than this. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is closer but not exactly matching.

Hmm, but earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires lower energy than the vibrational, so why is that?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the energy levels. Because in the non-rigid rotor model, perhaps the energy levels include both rotational and vibrational. Or, maybe the question is that the molecule can transition to the next higher energy state, which might not necessarily be rotation or vibration but a combination.

Wait, maybe the molecule is in the lowest state (v=0, J=0), and the next state would be the first excited state, which is the state with the next lowest energy. So the next state could be either v=0, J=1 or v=1, J=0. But which one has lower energy?

Hmmm. Because the rotational energy for J=1 is 2B, which is about 9e-23 J, and the vibrational energy for v=1 is about 2.6e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy would be 2B.

But my calculation of that gives a momentum of about 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is way lower than the options. The options are about 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is higher by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I messed up in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, B is defined as (h c_e)/(8 pi² R² c), but perhaps I'm confusing different forms of the rotational constant. Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of cm^-1, which is why maybe I should have converted R into centimeters.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters, which is 0.2 nanometers. To convert to centimeters, 2e-10 m = 2e-8 cm. So R = 2e-8 cm.

Hmm. Alternative approach: Maybe I should compute the rotational constant B in wavenumbers (cm^-1), then compute the energy difference in terms of that.

Wait, the rotational constant in terms of energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. Alternatively, B (cm^-1) = (h)/(8 pi^2 c I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps I can compute B in cm^-1 and then convert that to energy.

Let me try that. Compute B in cm^-1.

I = μ R².

μ in kg: 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m = 2e-8 cm.

So I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-8 cm)^2 = 3.01e-27 kg * 4e-16 cm² = 1.204e-42 kg·cm².

Wait, but wait, 1 kg·cm² = 1e-7 kg·m² (since 1 cm = 0.01 m, so cm² is 1e-4 m², but 1 kg·cm² = 1 kg * (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 kg·m². Wait, no, 1 cm² = (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 1 kg·cm² = 1e-4 kg·m². So 1.204e-42 kg·cm² = 1.204e-42 * 1e-4 = 1.204e-46 kg·m², which matches what I had earlier.

So to compute B in cm^-1:

B = (h)/(8 pi² c I) → where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e10 cm/s), I is moment of inertia in kg·cm²? Wait, no, the units might be tricky.

Wait, let's think about units. The rotational constant B in cm^-1 is given by:

B = h / (8 pi² c I) * (1 / (2)) → Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the formula.

The rotational constant in cm⁻¹ is:

B = (h) / (8π² c I) * (1/ (2)) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

E_rot (in J) = (h² / (8π² I)) J (J + 1)

But I can also express E_rot in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹):

B (cm⁻¹) = (h)/(8π² c I)

So B = (6.626e-34 J·s) / (8 * (pi)^2 * 3e10 cm/s * 1.204e-46 kg·m² )

Wait, wait, need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me convert I into kg·cm².

I was 1.204e-46 kg·m². Since 1 m = 100 cm, 1 m² = 10^4 cm². So 1 kg·m² = 1e4 kg·cm². So I = 1.204e-46 kg·m² = 1.204e-46 * 1e4 kg·cm² = 1.204e-42 kg·cm².

So B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * pi^2 * 3e10 * 1.204e-42 )

Compute denominator:

8 * pi^2 ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

3e10 * 1.204e-42 ≈ 3.612e-32.

Multiply 78.9568 * 3.612e-32 ≈ 78.9568 *3.612 ≈ 285.3 → 285.3e-32 → 2.853e-30.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 2.853e-30 ≈ 2.322e-4 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, so B is about 2.32e-4 cm⁻¹. But I'm not sure if that helps me. Let me think about energy.

E_rot for J=1 is 2B, which would be 4.64e-4 cm⁻¹. Convert that to energy in J.

Energy E = B * J (J+1) * hc, where B is in cm⁻¹.

Wait, E = B cm⁻¹ * hc → E = (2.32e-4 cm⁻¹) * (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 cm/s) → Wait, no, because c is in cm/s.

Wait, E = B * hc.

Wait, no, more accurately, E (in J) = B (cm⁻¹) * h (J·s) * c (cm/s).

So plugging in B = 2.32e-4 cm⁻¹,

E = 2.32e-4 * 6.626e-34 * 3e10 cm/s.

Wait, 3e10 cm/s is 3e8 m/s, but wait, 3e10 cm/s is correct because 1 cm = 0.01 m.

Wait, compute 6.626e-34 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-23.

Multiply by 2.32e-4: 1.9878e-23 * 2.32e-4 ≈ 4.6e-27 J.

Wait, that's E_rot = 4.6e-27 J.

Wait, earlier calculation via J·s and m gave 9.22e-23 J, which is a big discrepancy. So I must be making a mistake somewhere in the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in Joules and then the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me double-check the rotational energy formula.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J (J+1). So yes, for J=0, E=0; J=1, E=2B, where B= ħ²/(2I).

So I'll stick with the initial calculation of 2B=9.22e-23 J.

But earlier calculation of the photon's momentum being ≈3e-31 kg·m/s doesn't match any options. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the model isn't just about rotation or vibration, but both are considered, and the next state is a higher vibration with lower rotation. Or maybe the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first state with higher energy, which could be the vibrational state (v=1, J=0) or the rotational state (v=0, J=1). Which one has lower energy?

As I computed earlier, the energy for v=1 is about 2.65e-19 J, and for J=1, it's about 9.22e-23 J. So the rotational transition is lower in energy. So the photon should have energy 9.22e-23 J.

But the calculated momentum is way lower than the options. Let's see the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Wait, 3e-31 is about 3e-4 times smaller than option D (1.4e-28). So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1e4 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of B. Let me re-calculate B correctly.

I = μ R².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu = 20/11 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 20/11 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m.

So I = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 / (2 * 1.204e-46 kg·m²).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Denominator: 2 * 1.204e-46 = 2.408e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 ≈ 4.618e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.236e-23 J.

Now, E_photon = 9.236e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.236e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.078e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.078e-31 N·s (since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s).

But the options are all around 1e-28 N·s, which is 3 orders of magnitude higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units for R?

Wait, the bond length R is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used centimeters, but that would make I much smaller, which would make B larger.

Wait, R in cm is 2e-8 cm. Let me recalculate I in kg·cm².

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-8 cm)^2 = 3.01e-27 * 4e-16 cm² → 1.204e-42 kg·cm².

Now, B = ħ²/(2 I). But ħ is in J·s, I in kg·cm². Wait, need to convert units.

Wait, to compute B in J, I need to have I in kg·m². So the earlier calculation was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used B in terms of cm⁻¹, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the model isn't just a rigid rotor but includes the vibrational energy. So the overall energy of the molecule is E = E_vib + E_rot.

In that case, the transition could be either a change in vibration or rotation. But the next state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increase.

Wait, if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), then the next possible states are:

1. v=0, J=1 → E = 2B.

2. v=1, J=0 → E = h w.

So as w is 4e14 rad/s, E = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Which is much larger than 2B (9.2e-23 J).

Thus, the photon must have energy 2B to cause the transition to v=0, J=1.

But since the momentum calculation isn't matching any of the options, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to a transition to the next vibrational state (v=1) with the lowest possible rotation state (J=0). But that would require a higher energy photon.

Wait, but the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy". So the next state should be the one with the smallest possible energy increase.

So the molecule is currently in the ground state, and the next state is the one with the minimal energy above it. So that would be the rotational transition, requiring lower energy.

But that gives a photon momentum way smaller than any of the options. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation of μ.

Wait, μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, 20 amu is the mass of X, 2 amu is the mass of Y. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the total energy of the molecule including both rotation and vibration, and the next state is the combination that's the next in energy.

Alternatively, maybe the transition is a combination where both v and J change. But I don't think that's the case for the lowest energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, but I can't see why the photon's momentum would be so low according to my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which complicates things. But I'm not familiar with that part of the model. Maybe that affects the moment of inertia?

Non-rigid rotor model considers bond elongation due to rotation. But in that case, the moment of inertia increases with rotation, leading to a centrifugal distortion. But I'm not sure how to apply that here for the current problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually referring to the photon's energy causing a transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator for vibration and a rigid rotor for rotation. So the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot.

The ground state is v=0, J=0: E_initial = (1/2) h w + 0.

The next possible state could be either v=1, J=0 → E = (3/2) h w + 0.

Or v=0, J=1 → E = (1/2) h w + 2 B.

Which of these is higher?

Compute E for J=1: (1/2) h w + 2B.

Wait, no, wait: E_rot = B J (J+1). For J=0, E_rot=0; J=1, E_rot=2B.

So E_total for v=0, J=1 is (1/2) h w + 2B.

E_total for v=1, J=0 is (3/2) h w + 0.

Which one is lower?

We have E_rot = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

E_vib for v=1 is (3/2) h w = 3.975e-19 J.

So 9.2e-23 J is much less than 3.975e-19 J. So the state v=0, J=1 has lower energy than v=1, J=0.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is v=0, J=1. So the energy difference is E = 2B.

But then the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg·m/s, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), then the next state with the lowest energy might be v=0, J=1, which requires 2B.

But the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg·m/s, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the first state that has higher energy. But which state has the next higher energy? It would be v=0, J=1, as that's lower in energy than v=1, J=0.

So the energy difference is 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are all about 1e-27 or 1e-28, which is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude larger.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the photon's momentum using the vibrational energy instead. Let's try that.

E_photon = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/(c) = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s = 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is about half of that. Hmm, but why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition to the next state, which might involve both a rotational and vibrational change. Or perhaps the model includes the zero-point energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy being the sum of the rotational and vibrational parts, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me recheck that.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. That seems correct.

Wait, oh! I think I see the mistake. The bond length R is given as 2 angstroms. But when calculating the moment of inertia, is R the equilibrium bond length? And perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length varies with vibration. But for the ground state, R is fixed. Hmm, but the question says the model is the non-rigid rotor model. Does that affect the calculation of the moment of inertia?

Wait, non-rigid rotor model doesn't use a fixed R. Instead, the bond length is variable, and that complicates the energy levels. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we're supposed to use the given R as the equilibrium bond length.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the vibrational energy, as the rotational transition requires much lower energy but doesn't match the options, whereas the vibrational transition gives an option close to option A.

Wait, option A is 1.9e-28 N·s. My calculation for the vibrational transition gives about 8.8e-28, which is close to option D (1.4e-28), but not exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's re-calculate E_photon for the vibrational transition:

E = h * w = 6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 / 3e8 = 8.835e-28 kg·m/s = 8.835e-28 N·s.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option A (1.9e-28), which is about a fifth of this value.

Wait, perhaps there's another mistake. Oh! I think I know where I went wrong. The energy difference for the vibrational transition is not h w, but h w times (v+1/2 - v' + 1/2), but in the ground state (v=0), the transition to v=1 would be h w (since 1/2 h w is the zero point energy). So E = h w (v=1) - zero point (v=0) → E = h w.

Wait, no, the energy for v=0 is (1/2) h w, and for v=1, it's (3/2) h w. So the difference is h w. So that part is correct.

So why is the calculated momentum 8.8e-28, but the options are around 1e-28 to 1e-27. So option D is 1.4e-28, which is about 1/6th of the value I have.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the transition with a photon that has energy equal to the vibrational energy. So the answer would be around 8.8e-28, but none of the options match exactly.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 1.1e-27, which is about 10 times larger than option A (1.9e-28). So perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using w in terms of cm⁻¹, not radians per second.

Wait, angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s. To convert to wavenumbers (cm⁻¹), we can use the relation w = c * cmu, where cmu is the wavenumber.

cmu = w/(2 pi c) → but wait, wait, the relation between angular frequency and wavenumber is w = c * cmu * 2 pi.

So cmu = w/(2 pi c).

So let's compute cmu (wavenumber):

cmu = (4e14 rad/s) / (2 * pi * 3e10 cm/s) → 4e14 / (6e10 * pi) → 4e14 / 1.885e11 ≈ 2.12e3 cm⁻¹.

Then, the vibrational energy is E = h cmu → h = 6.626e-34 J·s, cmu = 2.12e3 cm⁻¹.

E = 6.626e-34 * 2.12e3 = 1.404e-30 J.

Wait, that's a much smaller energy than before. So p = E / c = 1.404e-30 /3e8 = 4.68e-39 kg·m/s.

Which is even smaller, not matching any options. So this approach doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the energy in terms of the rotational-vibrational coupling, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think about the concept again. The question is about the momentum of the photon needed to cause the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest energy. The molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which is J=1 (rotational) with energy 2B.

But according to my calculation, the photon's momentum is 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s, which is 3e-4 times smaller than option D (1.4e-28). So perhaps I missed a factor of 1e4 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me re-calculate B.

Wait, B = ħ²/(2I).

I = μ R².

μ = 20 *2/(20+2) amu = 20/11 amu = approx 1.818 amu.

Convert μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.66e-27 kg → μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms → 2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ = h/(2 pi) = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J²·s².

B = ħ²/(2I) = 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.204e-46) ) → 1.112e-68 / 2.408e-46 = 4.618e-23 J.

So 2B =9.236e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c =9.236e-23 /3e8 = 3.078e-31 kg·m/s.

Hmm, but this is way smaller than the options. So perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition, which gives a momentum around 8.8e-28, but that's not matching any option exactly.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's energy being the difference between the first and second vibrational states. No, because that would require even higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum. Let me recheck.

E_photon = 9.236e-23 J.

p = E / c = 9.236e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.078e-31 kg·m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but the options are all on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate using the vibrational energy, even though it's a higher energy transition.

Wait, let's try that. E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg·m/s → 8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is approximately 1/6th of this value. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation of h w?

Wait, h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the rotational model, but I'm using the wrong formula for B.

Alternatively, perhaps B is expressed in terms of cm⁻¹, and I should compute the energy E_rot as B (cm⁻¹) multiplied by hc.

So E_rot = B (cm⁻¹) * h c.

Earlier, I calculated B as 2.32e-4 cm⁻¹.

So E_rot = 2.32e-4 cm⁻¹ *6.626e-34 J·s *3e10 cm/s.

Wait, 3e10 cm/s is 3e8 m/s, but in cm/s, it's 3e10 cm/s.

So E_rot = 2.32e-4 * 6.626e-34 *3e10.

Compute that: 2.32e-4 *6.626e-34 =1.537e-37.

Multiply by 3e10: 4.611e-27 J.

So E_rot = 4.611e-27 J.

Wait, that's a different value than before. So 2B would be about 9.22e-27 J.

Wait, but earlier when using B in J, I got 2B as 9.23e-23 J, which is way higher.

So which one is correct?

This is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, B in cm⁻¹ is 2.32e-4 cm⁻¹. So the energy corresponding to B in cm⁻¹ is E = B * h c.

So E =2.32e-4 cm⁻¹ *6.626e-34 J·s *3e10 cm/s.

Wait, cm⁻¹ * cm/s = s⁻¹, which is rad/s? Not quite, but the product would be in energy terms.

Wait, 1 cm⁻¹ * 1 cm/s = 1 s⁻¹.

So E =2.32e-4 *6.626e-34 *3e10 = 2.32e-4 *1.9878e-23 =4.617e-27 J.

So 2B would be 9.23e-27 J. Then, the photon's energy is 9.23e-27 J.

p_photon = E/c =9.23e-27 /3e8 =3.076e-35 kg·m/s. Which is even smaller.

Wait, no. Wait, 9.23e-27 J /3e8 m/s =3.076e-35 kg·m/s.

Still way smaller than the options.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels are quantized, and the photon's energy must match the energy difference between two states. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy is the minimum possible energy difference, which is the rotational transition.

But according to my previous calculation, that's 9.2e-23 J, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the photon's momentum using the vibrational transition, but the given options are much lower than what I calculated. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate E_photon for the vibrational transition.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg·m/s →8.8347e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28), but it's about half of that. Hmm, perhaps there's a factor of 2 missing.

Wait, is the energy difference for the vibrational transition actually h w / 2? Because sometimes the vibrational energy levels are written as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w. So the difference between v=0 →v=1 is h w.

So I don't think that's the case. So perhaps the question is referring to the rotational transition, but the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the fundamental state as the ground state. Wait, the question says, "the molecule is in its fundamental state." The fundamental state is usually the lowest energy, so v=0, J=0.

Wait, maybe the question is about the transition to the next state, which could be a combination of both vibrational and rotational changes, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the given options are off by a factor of 1e4.

But without further information, I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which is 1.9e-28 N·s, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a combination, but I don't know the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the photon causing a change in the rotational state, but the calculation should involve the moment of inertia differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the angular momentum quantum number change.

Wait, another thought: the momentum of the photon p is related to its wavelength λ by p = h / λ. And since E = h f = h c / λ, combining these gives E = p c, so p = E / c.

So my earlier approach is correct.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should use the rotational constant B in terms of energy, where B = ħ²/(2 I).

But perhaps I should have used the bond length in a different unit.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Another thought: maybe the question is about the photon causing a transition in the vibration, but the photon's energy is equal to the vibrational energy. But the calculated momentum is 8.8e-28 N·s, which isn't an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

If I'm getting 8.8e-28, perhaps the correct option is not present, but the closest is option A (1.9e-28), but it's about a factor of 5 off.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state as the first rotational state, but with a different formula.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the options, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. The vibrational transition gives a momentum of around 8.8e-28, but that's not an option. The rotational transition gives 3e-31, which is way too small. Maybe the intended answer is option D, which is 1.4e-28. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in a calculation, and the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question is about the photon causing a transition from J=0 to J=1, which requires energy 2B. Let me compute B again.

B = ħ²/(2 I).

Compute I again: μ = (20 *2)/(22) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

μ in kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² =3.01e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46 kg·m².

B = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 *1.204e-46) = (1.112e-68)/(2.408e-46) =4.618e-23 J.

2B =9.236e-23 J.

p =9.236e-23 /3e8 =3.078e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.078e-31 N·s.

But again, none of the options match.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is based on the vibrational transition, but I think I'm missing something.

After all this, I'll have to make a choice. Based on the initial analysis, the rotational transition requires lower energy, but the momentum doesn't match the options. Alternatively, the vibrational transition's momentum is about 8.8e-28, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not quite.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B, perhaps by a factor of 1e4.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate B using R in centimeters.

R =2 angstroms =2e-8 cm.

I = μ R² =3.01e-27 kg * (2e-8 cm)^2 =3.01e-27 *4e-16 cm² =1.204e-42 kg·cm².

Wait, but to compute B in J, I need to convert I to kg·m². 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 1 cm²=1e-4 m². So 1 kg·cm² = 1e-4 kg·m².

So I =1.204e-42 kg·cm² =1.204e-42 *1e-4 =1.204e-46 kg·m².

Which brings me back to the same calculation as before.

So, I think I'm stuck. Given the available options and the fact that my rotational transition calculation doesn't match any options, I'll have to go with the vibrational transition, even though it's not matching exactly. The closest option to 8.8e-28 is option A (1.9e-28), but that's about a factor of 4.6 off.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the photon's momentum to be based on the rotational transition but for some reason, the calculation yields option C (1.1e-27), but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy as the sum of the rotational and vibrational differences, but that's unlikely.

In the absence of a clear path, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the question asks for the next state with the lowest energy, the rotational transition's energy is much lower, but the momentum is way off. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the vibrational transition, leading to option A or D.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the molecule transitioning to the next state, which could involve a change in both vibration and rotation. But without more information, it's hard to proceed.

In conclusion, after all this, I think the correct answer is based on the rotational transition, but due to a possible miscalculation, I'll choose the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, which would be option A, 1.9e-28 N·s.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences associated with rotational and vibrational transitions.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Fundamental State and Next State**:  
   The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest energy state: \( v = 0 \) (vibrational ground state) and \( J = 0 \) (rotational ground state). The next state with the lowest energy could either be \( v = 0, J = 1 \) (rotational transition) or \( v = 1, J = 0 \) (vibrational transition).  

2. **Energy Differences**:  
   - **Rotational Transition**:  
     The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) is the rotational constant. For \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \), the energy difference is \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \).  
     - Reduced mass \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu} \).  
     - Moment of inertia \( I = \mu R^2 = (1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 \approx 1.204 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \).  
     - Rotational constant \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.204 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.62 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  
     - Energy difference for \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \): \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \approx 9.24 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).  

   - **Vibrational Transition**:  
     The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(\frac{1}{2} + v\right) h \omega \). For \( v = 0 \to v = 1 \), the energy difference is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \).  
     - Given \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).  

3. **Photon Momentum**:  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).  
   - For the rotational transition:  
     \( p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.24 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} \).  
   - For the vibrational transition:  
     \( p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \).  

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( 3.08 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)) is far smaller than any of the given options. For the vibrational transition (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} \)), the closest option is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \)**, though it is about a factor of 4.6 off.  

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires less energy, but the calculated momentum does not match any of the options. The vibrational transition, while requiring more energy, aligns more closely with the given options. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **A**, though it is not an exact match.  

Answer: A
