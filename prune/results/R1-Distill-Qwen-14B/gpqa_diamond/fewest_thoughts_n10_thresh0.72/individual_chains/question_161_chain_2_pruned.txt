Okay, so I've got this electron microscopy question to tackle, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So, the setup is that Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope that's operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum state, which is less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. The goal here is to minimize gas molecules because that's better for electron microscopy. But despite that, some gas particles are still present, and the mass spectrometer detected them. Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1, considering factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd about the mean free path based on electron scattering. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2, even though the temperature remains the same. The question is asking what we can conclude about λ2 compared to λ1.

Hmm. I remember that the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, if the pressure is lower, the MFP is longer because the molecules don't collide as often. But wait, in this case, the pressure is already ultra-low, but when the electron beam is on, something changes.

Wait, the initial MFP is λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. But when the electron beam is initiated, the mean free path changes to λ2. Why would that be?

Oh, right! When you have an electron beam passing through the sample compartment, it can cause some effects. One thing that comes to mind is that the electron beam might ionize the remaining gas molecules. If the gas is ionized, the ions can move more easily towards the walls of the chamber because they have a charge and are attracted to the walls. This process is called sputtering or perhaps they're being pumped away more effectively.

Wait, but if the gas is ionized, the number of neutral gas molecules would decrease. The mean free path depends on the number of collisions between gas molecules. But in this scenario, the gas particles are the ones that are causing scattering of the electron beam. So if the
