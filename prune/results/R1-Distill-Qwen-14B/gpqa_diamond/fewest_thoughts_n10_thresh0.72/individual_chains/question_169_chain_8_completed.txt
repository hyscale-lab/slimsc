Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear decay. Hmm, let me read the question again. 

So the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Now, in the variant, instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. I need to compare the E spectrum in this new scenario to the original.

Wait, I remember that in nuclear decays, the emitted particles' energy spectra depend on whether they are involved in the conservation laws, like energy and momentum. Oh right, in beta decay, for example, the electron's energy spectrum is continuous because the electron and the antineutrino share the energy released, and that's why the maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the Q value.

So in the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. Since the E particles have a continuous spectrum, I think maybe the V particles are involved in carrying away some energy. If V is a regular particle, like a neutron or something, then their presence would affect the energy sharing.

Now, the variant changes the emission from 2V to 1M, which is massless. Wait, so the number of particles has changed. Originally, it's two E and two V. Now, it's 2E and one M. Oh, wait, the question says it emits one M instead of two V. Because it's 2V → 1M. Hmm, that's an important point.

Wait, but the original decay has 2E and 2V. So in the first case, four particles are emitted: 2 E and 2 V. In the variant, it's 2 E and 1 M, making three particles in total. But the key here is whether the energy spectrum of the E particles changes.

Let me think about the original process. In the decay 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V, all the particles are emitted. The energy of each E depends on how the energy and momentum are shared among all the products.

If the particles are emitted in all possible energy-momentum combinations that conserve energy and momentum, the spectrum for E would be continuous. The maximum energy (endpoint) occurs when all the energy is given to each E, but that's probably when the other particles (V) take away as little as possible. But because there are more particles, the endpoint might be lower.

Wait, but in the original case, perhaps the presence of V affects the max energy the E can have. Now, in the variant, we have one M which is massless. Since M is massless, maybe it behaves like a photon or a neutrino, which carry energy but don't have rest mass.

Wait, how about considering the conservation of energy and momentum. In the original case, since there are two V particles, each E can't take all the available energy because some is taken by the V's. But in the variant, perhaps with only one M, which is massless, the energy can be shared differently.

Wait, for the original case, when you have two E and two V, each E can have a certain maximum energy when their energies are maximized. But since there are two V, which also carry energy, the maximum energy each E can have is limited. So the endpoint Q is the maximum energy each E can have.

In the variant, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So now, we have one M. Because M is massless, perhaps it's like a photon. In the case of a photon, the energy is E = pc, so it can take away energy in a way that affects the E particles.

Wait, let's imagine that in the variant, the particles are 2E and 1M. So the E's are emitted along with this M, which is massless. So for each E, their maximum energy might be higher because perhaps the M can take away more energy, but since M is massless, maybe it's easier for the E's to have higher energies.

Wait, but in the original case, there were two V particles that might have mass. Let's think about the total energy available. The Q value is the total energy released in the decay. So the total energy available is Q.

In the original decay, the 2E + 2V would share this Q. So each E can have up to Q/2, but that's assuming the V take zero energy, which is not possible because they have mass.

Wait, no. The maximum energy each E can have is when the other particles (V) take the minimum possible energy. But for particles with mass, the minimum energy is their rest mass energy. But if the V have mass, say m, then each V would have at least m*c². So if there are two V, you have 2m*c² subtracted from Q, leaving (Q - 2mc²) to be shared among the E's. But if the V are massless, like M, then their rest mass is zero, so they can take energy without that constraint.

Wait, but in the variant, the M is massless. So when considering the energy distribution, the M can carry away more energy without the constraint of rest mass, allowing the E's to have higher energies. But wait, in the original case, the V's have mass, so the maximum energy an E could have is (Q - 2mc²) divided by 2 (assuming the two E split the remaining energy). So the endpoint in the original case is (Q - 2mc²)/2, but in the variant, the M being massless allows for more energy to be given to the E's.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. Hmm, that suggests that the maximum energy of each E is Q. But how is that possible if there are other particles being emitted?

Wait, perhaps the V particles are not carrying away any energy. Oh wait, no, because in the decay, all the products share the energy. So that can't be. So I must be missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the V particles are massless too. Because in the original decay, E has a continuous spectrum. For a continuous spectrum, it's usually because multiple particles are emitted, and each can take a varying amount of energy, leading to a range of possible energies for E. The maximum E occurs when all the available energy (Q) is given to that E, but that's only possible if the other emitted particles take zero energy.

But if the other particles have rest mass, they can't take zero energy. So perhaps in the original decay, the V particles have negligible mass or are massless. Wait, no, because if V is massless, then their energy can go to zero, but the original decay's E's have a maximum energy Q.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again. The problem states that in the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So the maximum possible energy an E can have is Q.

In the original decay, the products are 2B (nuclei), 2E, and 2V. So for each E, the maximum energy would be when all the energy goes into that E, but since the other particles (the V and the other E) have to take some energy as well, the maximum E is less than or equal to Q. But the problem says the maximum is Q, which implies that the other particles (like V) can take zero energy. But if V has mass, that can't happen because they need to have at least their rest mass energy. So that suggests that the V particles are massless.

Wait, if the V particles are massless, then they can take away any amount of energy, including zero. So in the original decay, when the V's are massless, the maximum energy for each E is Q (when the other E and all the V's take zero). But since there are two E's and two V's, perhaps the maximum energy each E can have is when all the other particles take zero. But that's only possible if they can have zero, which is possible if they're massless.

Wait, but in reality, even if a particle is massless, it can't have zero energy because energy and momentum are linked. Because for a massless particle, E = pc. So if the particle is emitted in the same direction as the E, then you can have the E taking more energy, but the other particles taking less.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider a simpler case. Imagine a decay where one particle decays into two particles, say, A → B + V. If V is massless, then the energy of B can vary, leading to a continuous spectrum. The maximum energy occurs when V takes zero energy, so B takes all the energy. But wait, since V is massless, it can take zero energy only if it's not moving, which isn't possible because momentum must be conserved. So in reality, the energy of B can't reach the full Q, but in the problem statement, it's given that the E's have endpoint Q. So perhaps in this problem, the other particles (V and M) are massless, but in a way that allows E to take up all of Q.

Alternatively, perhaps the V and M are neutrinos, which are massless (though in reality, they have tiny masses, but for this problem, we can take them as massless).

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So, assuming V is massless, the energy of E depends on how much energy the V take. Since the V is massless, they can take any amount of energy, but in a decay, the energy distribution must conserve both energy and momentum.

In the original case, the E's have a continuous spectrum because their energies can vary as the momenta of the V's adjust. But because there are two E and two V, the possible combinations lead to a continuous distribution for each E. The maximum energy (endpoint) is Q, which would occur when all the energy goes into a single E, but that's only possible if the other E and V take zero, which isn't possible because momentum must be conserved.

Wait, but the problem states that the E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q, so perhaps the V's are not carrying any energy. That doesn't make sense because that would violate momentum conservation.

Wait, maybe the particles are moving in such a way that the E's can have up to Q each. But that can't be, because the total energy released is Q. So if one E takes Q, the others must take zero, which isn't possible.

So perhaps the problem is that in the original decay, the maximum energy each E can have is Q/2. Because there are two E's, each can take up to Q/2. But that would make the endpoint Q/2. But the problem says the E's have an endpoint Q, so that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the problem in terms of whether the E's are subject to conservation laws differently in the two scenarios.

In the original decay, 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The E's are emitted along with the V's. Since all particles are involved in the decay, the E's can only have energies up to a certain point based on the energy partitioning with the V's.

In the variant, it's 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So now, instead of two V's, there's one M. M is massless, so it's like a photon or a neutrino. How does this affect the E's maximum energy?

Because M is massless, it can carry away more energy without requiring a rest mass. So perhaps the E's can have higher energies than before. Let me think: in the original decay, the E's shared energy with two V's. Each V would have some energy, which would limit how much the E's could have. In the variant, with only one M, which is massless, the E's can take more energy because M can take away more of the remaining energy, allowing each E to have a higher maximum.

Wait, but the total energy available is the same (since it's the same decay, the Q value is the same). So in the original decay, the maximum energy an E can have is when the other E and the two V's take the minimum possible. But if V's are massive, their minimum is their rest mass. If they're massless, then their minimum is zero, but that's not possible because of momentum.

Wait, perhaps when V is massless, the maximum energy an E can have is higher than when V has mass. So if in the original decay, V have mass, then the E's are limited in their maximum energy. In the variant, V is replaced by M, which is massless, so the maximum energy each E can have increases.

Wait, but the initial problem says that in the original decay, the E's have a maximum endpoint Q. That suggests that in the original, the maximum energy is Q, which implies that the other particles (the other E and V) can somehow take zero energy, but that's only possible if they're massless. So perhaps in the original decay, the V are massless, and the E's maximum is Q.

In that case, the variant is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Now, M is massless. So, with one M instead of two V's, but all being massless.

How does the number of massless particles affect the maximum energy of E's?

Wait, maybe the number of massless particles affects the possible energy distribution. Let's think: in the original decay, you have two E and two V. All four are massless (assuming V is massless as in the original scenario that allows E to reach Q). So the decay products are four massless particles and two B's (which are heavy, so their kinetic energy is negligible compared to E and V).

Wait, but the B's are heavy, so their kinetic energy is much less than the E and V's. So the total energy is approximately Q, which is the sum of the E and V's energies.

In the original, four particles (2E, 2V) are massless. So each can take any portion of the energy, leading to a continuous spectrum for each E. But because there are four particles, the maximum energy any single E can have is Q (if the others take zero), but that's not possible because momentum must be conserved. Wait, but for massless particles, the momentum is in the same direction as energy. So if all four particles are emitted in the same direction, then each can take a portion.

Wait, perhaps when all particles are massless and moving in the same direction, the energy can be distributed in a way that one E can take all the energy, making the endpoint Q. But that's only possible if all other particles take none, which is impossible due to momentum conservation. So I'm getting stuck again.

Maybe it's better to think about the number of particles. In the original, more particles (four: 2E, 2V) are involved, so the energy is shared among more, leading to a lower maximum for each E. In the variant, only three particles (2E, 1M) are involved, so each E can have a higher maximum, because the M can take more of the energy, allowing the E's to reach higher.

So in the original case, with four massless particles, the maximum energy each E can have is lower than in the variant with three. So the endpoint for E's in the variant would be higher than Q. But wait, no, because the total Q is the same.

Wait, but the original decay's E's have endpoint Q. So if the variant allows E to have higher energies, that would imply the endpoint increases. But in the original, the E's already have the maximum possible energy (Q). So this line of reasoning might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of more particles (like two V's) in the original decay allows more ways for the energy to be distributed, leading to a continuous spectrum. But in the variant, fewer particles (only one M) would change how the energy is shared, possibly leading to a different spectrum.

Wait, another thought: in beta decay, when a nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino, the electron's energy is continuous because the antineutrino carries away some energy. If another particle were emitted, like a photon, the electron's spectrum would change. But in this case, it's two E and two V in the original, and two E and one M in the variant.

So, in the original, since there are more particles (four), the energy is more fragmented, leading to a lower maximum for each E. In the variant, with three particles, perhaps the E's can have higher maximum energy. But wait, the original E's already have maximum Q. So this might not hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of more particles (more massless particles) allows the E's to have a higher maximum because the energy is distributed differently. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let's consider the conservation of four-momentum. The initial state is two A's, which are heavy, so their rest frame is where we can analyze this.

In the rest frame of the two A's, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum must still be zero. So the sum of the momenta of all the decay products must be zero.

In the original decay: 2E + 2V.

Each E and V is massless, so their energy is |p|c, and their momentum vectors must sum to zero.

In the original scenario, since there are four particles, the possible combinations of momenta are more varied, leading to a continuous spectrum of energies for each E.

In the variant, it's 2E and 1 M. So three particles. Each is massless, so their momenta must sum to zero.

The energy of each E and M is |p|c. So for the variant, when considering the possible momenta configurations, perhaps the E's can reach higher energies than before because there's one fewer particle to share the momentum with.

Wait, but the M is massless and emitted in some direction. For the E's, their maximum energy would be when the M takes as much energy as possible in the opposite direction, allowing each E to have higher energy. Or perhaps when the M is emitted in a way that allows the E's to have higher energies.

Wait, but if the M is emitted in the opposite direction to the E's, that could allow the E's to have higher energies. Because the M's momentum in the opposite direction would balance the E's momenta, allowing the E's to have larger momenta (and thus larger energy) than before.

In the original decay, with four massless particles, any E's maximum energy is limited by the need to balance their momentum with the other three particles. But in the variant, with three particles, perhaps the maximum energy each E can have is higher.

Alternatively, maybe in the original decay, each E can have a maximum energy of Q/2, because with four particles, each would take a portion. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the endpoint of the E's increases when there are fewer particles to share the energy with. So in the variant, the E's have a higher maximum energy.

Wait, but the problem says that in the original decay, the E's have endpoint Q. So the maximum energy is Q, which is the total available energy. But that can only happen if all other particles take zero energy, which is impossible unless they are massless and take zero momentum, which isn't possible because of momentum conservation.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the implications of the problem.

The options are about whether the E spectrum remains continuous or becomes discrete, and whether the endpoint increases or decreases.

In the original, the E's have a continuous spectrum because their energy can vary. The presence of two V's (massless) allows for continuous distribution, leading to a continuous E spectrum.

In the variant, with one M (massless), perhaps the same continuous spectrum remains but with a different shape. Or maybe the spectrum becomes discrete.

Wait, another approach: think about whether the number of particles emitted affects the spectrum's continuity. In beta decay, adding more particles (like a photon) can change the spectrum. For example, in double beta decay, if a photon is emitted, the electron spectrum might change.

But in this case, the original decay has two E and two V. The variant has two E and one M.

If the V were massive, then the E's would have a continuous spectrum because the V's would carry away some energy, but their mass would limit the maximum energy. However, if V are massless, the E's can get up to Q, but with four particles, the distribution might lead to a continuous spectrum.

In the variant, with one M, perhaps the E's can have a higher maximum energy because there's one fewer particle to share the energy with. But in the original, the E's already have maximum Q, so that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of more particles (four) allows for more sharing, leading to a lower maximum for each E. But in the variant, with three particles, each E can have a higher maximum.

But I'm not sure. Looking at the options, they suggest whether the spectrum becomes discrete or remains continuous.

If the number of particles changes, perhaps the nature of the energy distribution changes. For example, if you have an even number of particles, maybe the spectrum is continuous, whereas an odd number could lead to a different behavior.

Wait, but the problem states that in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum. So in the variant, whether it remains continuous depends on the number of particles.

Wait, another thought: in the original decay, with two E and two V, since each E and V are massless, the system's degrees of freedom allow for a continuous distribution of energies. In the variant, with two E and one M, there are three massless particles. The conservation laws would now require that the sum of their momenta is zero. With three particles, perhaps the energy distribution allows each E to have a higher maximum, but the spectrum remains continuous.

So, in the variant, the E's can have higher energies, so the endpoint increases.

So looking at the options, option B says the spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.

Option D says the spectrum remains continuous and the endpoint decreases.

In the original, the E's maximum is Q.

In the variant, can the maximum be higher than Q? No, because Q is the total available energy. So each E's maximum can't exceed Q. But in the original, the E's have a maximum of Q. So if the variant allows E to have higher maximum than Q, that's impossible. So perhaps my previous reasoning was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the endpoint in the original decay is Q, but in the variant, the maximum energy each E can have is higher because M can carry away more energy, but that's not possible since the total energy is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the E's in the variant can't have a higher maximum than before. Then the endpoint would stay the same.

But the question is about how the spectrum of E's changes. The options are about whether the spectrum becomes discrete or remains continuous, and the endpoint's change.

Wait, another approach: when you have an even number of identical massless particles, the energy spectrum of one type can be continuous because their momenta can be arranged to any possible combination that conserves momentum. For example, two photons can have a continuous spectrum because their directions and energies can vary. Similarly, two E and two V would allow for a continuous spectrum for E.

In the variant, with two E and one M, perhaps the energy distribution is different. Since there's an odd number of particles, it's harder to arrange their momenta. Or perhaps it's still possible, leading to a continuous spectrum.

Wait, but in the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum. If in the variant, the E's still have a continuous spectrum but with a higher maximum energy, then the endpoint Q would increase. But wait, the total energy is fixed at Q, so the maximum energy each E can have can't exceed Q.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider the degrees of freedom. In the original decay, with four particles, there are more variables, allowing more continuous energy distributions. In the variant, three particles, perhaps leading to a different distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of M (massless) and the change in the number of particles affects the maximum energy of the E's. If M is emitted, it can carry away more energy, allowing the E's to have higher energies, but without increasing beyond Q.

Wait, but if the E's are already at maximum Q in the original, then the variant can't have a higher maximum. So perhaps the endpoint remains the same.

But this is getting complicated. Let's look for another angle.

In the original decay, multiple particles are emitted, leading to a continuous spectrum. The E's have a maximum of Q. In the variant, the same number of E's are emitted, but with a different number of other particles. The E's maximum would be the same, but the shape of the spectrum might change.

Wait, but why would the shape change? Because the way energy is shared among the other particles is different. With two V's in the original, each V can take some energy, while in the variant, one M takes some.

But since M is massless, it can take more energy, which would allow the E's to have higher energies. But wait, the total energy is the same, so if M takes more energy, the E's must take less. That would lower the maximum energy for E's, which contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of it in terms of energy sharing.

In the original decay: 2E + 2V. Each V can take some energy, say, v1 and v2 for the two V. The E's take e1 and e2. The sum e1 + e2 + v1 + v2 = Q.

In the variant: 2E + M. The E's take e1 and e2, and M takes m. So e1 + e2 + m = Q.

In the original, the maximum energy for e1 would be when e2, v1, v2 are as small as possible. Since V are massless, they can take zero energy, but that's not possible due to momentum.

Wait, but if V are massless, they can take any energy as long as their momenta are in the opposite direction to the E's. So, the maximum e1 would be when the other E and the V's take as little as possible.

Similarly, in the variant, the maximum e1 would be when e2 and m take as little as possible.

So, perhaps the maximum e1 in the original is higher than in the variant, because in the original, there are two V's that can take away more energy, allowing e1 to be higher.

Wait, no. If the V's are massless, their energy is (pc), and they can take any amount, but their energy must be such that the sum of their momenta cancels the E's momenta.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let's try to think in terms of the number of particles.

Original: four massless particles (2E, 2V) → more particles → energy is more fragmented → lower maximum per E.

Variant: three massless particles (2E, 1M) → fewer → each E can have higher maximum.

Wait, but the total energy is the same, so if the E's take more, the M must take less.

Wait, but the M is only one, so perhaps the E's can take more. Let me imagine the extreme: in the original, all the V's take zero, so each E can take Q/2. But in the variant, the M takes zero, so each E can take Q/2 as well. But that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, in the original, each E can have up to Q/2, leading to an endpoint of Q/2. But the problem says the original E's have endpoint Q, which suggests that in the original decay, the E's can take up to all the energy, but that's only possible if the other particles take zero, which is impossible because of momentum.

Hmm, perhaps the original decay has V's that are massive. So in the original decay, the V's have mass, so each has a minimum energy based on their rest mass. So the maximum energy for each E is (Q - 2mV*c²)/2. So the endpoint is (Q-2mV c²)/2.

In the variant, the V's are replaced by M, which is massless. So the maximum energy for each E would be (Q - 0)/2 = Q/2. Wait, but that would mean the endpoint decreases, because (Q-2mV c²)/2 > Q/2 if mV is positive.

Wait no, if mV is positive, then (Q-2mV c²)/2 is less than Q/2. So in the variant, the maximum energy for E increases because M is massless.

So in the original, the endpoint is (Q-2mV c²)/2, which is less than Q/2. In the variant, the endpoint is (Q)/2, which is higher than before.

Wait, but the problem states that in the original decay, the E's have an endpoint Q. So perhaps in the original, the V's are massless, and the E's can have up to Q. So in the variant, with one massless M, the E's can have up to Q as well, but with a different distribution.

But I'm not making progress. Let's try to conclude.

The options are:

A) Spectrum becomes discrete, endpoint increases.

B) Spectrum remains continuous, endpoint increases.

C) Spectrum becomes discrete, endpoint decreases.

D) Spectrum remains continuous, endpoint decreases.

In the original decay, the E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q.

In the variant, the number of emitted particles changes from four (2E, 2V) to three (2E, 1M), with M massless.

If the number of particles changes, does the energy spectrum of E's become continuous or discrete? In the original, it's continuous. If the variant still allows for a continuous distribution, the spectrum remains continuous. So options B and D remain.

Now, endpoint: Does it increase or decrease?

If M is massless, perhaps the E's can take more energy than before. So the maximum energy for E's would be higher, leading to an increased endpoint. So the endpoint increases.

So the correct option is B: spectrum remains continuous, endpoint increases.


The problem involves a nuclear decay where two heavy nucleons of flavor A decay into two nucleons of flavor B, emitting two lighter particles E and two particles V in the original decay. The energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous with an endpoint value \( Q \). In the variant decay, the two V particles are replaced by one massless particle M. The task is to determine how the energy spectrum of the E particles changes in the variant decay compared to the original.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Original Decay (2A → 2B + 2E + 2V):**
   - The energy spectrum of the E particles is continuous, with an endpoint \( Q \). This implies that the energy of the E particles can vary continuously, and the maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the total energy released in the decay (\( Q \)).
   - The presence of two V particles, whether massive or massless, affects the energy distribution. If the V particles are massive, their rest mass energy imposes a lower limit on the energy they can carry, reducing the maximum energy available for the E particles. If the V particles are massless, they can carry away energy without a lower limit, but momentum conservation still restricts the energy distribution.

2. **Variant Decay (2A → 2B + 2E + M):**
   - In this case, the two V particles are replaced by a single massless particle M. Since M is massless, it can carry energy without a rest mass constraint, allowing for a different energy distribution among the decay products.
   - The total energy released in the decay (\( Q \)) remains the same, but the energy is now shared among two E particles and one M particle instead of two E particles and two V particles. This change in the number and properties of the emitted particles alters the energy distribution.

3. **Comparison of Energy Spectra:**
   - In the original decay, the continuous spectrum of the E particles arises from the varying energy sharing among the four emitted particles (2E + 2V). In the variant decay, the energy sharing is now among three particles (2E + 1M). Despite this change, the energy distribution remains continuous because there are still multiple ways to conserve energy and momentum.
   - The endpoint of the E particles' spectrum is determined by the maximum energy they can carry. In the variant decay, the presence of one massless M particle allows for a different energy distribution, potentially increasing the maximum energy available for the E particles compared to the original decay.

4. **Evaluation of Options:**
   - **(A)** The spectrum becoming discrete is unlikely, as the energy distribution remains continuous in both decays due to the conservation laws and the nature of the emitted particles.
   - **(B)** The spectrum remains continuous, and the endpoint increases. This is plausible because the replacement of two V particles with one massless M particle allows for a different energy distribution, potentially increasing the maximum energy available for the E particles.
   - **(C)** The spectrum becoming discrete and the endpoint decreasing is inconsistent with the conservation laws and the nature of the emitted particles.
   - **(D)** The spectrum remains continuous, and the endpoint decreases. This is unlikely because the replacement of two V particles with one massless M particle does not inherently reduce the maximum energy available for the E particles.

### Conclusion:
The energy spectrum of the E particles remains continuous in the variant decay, and the endpoint increases due to the altered energy distribution resulting from the replacement of two V particles with one massless M particle.

**Answer: B**
