Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what I can figure out.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The strong bands are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches, because those are in the range of 3300-3500. But wait, sometimes O-H from carboxylic acids can also show up there, but the intensity here is medium to strong, which might suggest either an amide or something else with N-H. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a big clue. That's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. If it's around 1720, that suggests it's an ester or maybe a ketone. But given the options, I'm thinking ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR now. The signals are at 1.20 ppm, a triplet integrating for 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to something that splits it into a triplet. Maybe an ethyl group, like CH2CH3. So the triplet at 1.2 ppm would be the CH2CH3's methyl.

Then there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. Broad singlet often suggests something like an NH group, but wait, the IR suggested N-H. But in the NMR, singlet at 4.0 for 2H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Like OCH2 attached to something else.

Then a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H. Quartet, so maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester. For example, in ethyl esters, the -OCH2CH3 group. Wait, the quartet would be the OCH2, and the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3. That makes sense for an ethyl group attached to an oxygen.

Looking at the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Those are two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So a para-substituted benzene, like two substituents opposite each other. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm suggests electron-withdrawing groups. So maybe a carbonyl attached to the ring, like a benzamide or an ester.

Let me think about the options. The options are A, B, C, D.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Wait, but benzamide would have the carbonyl attached to the benzene as a substituent. The ethoxy would be at the meta position.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So a formamide group (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the formamide would have the carbonyl at around 1700, which fits the IR. The ethoxy would be on the benzene ring at the para position.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a propionyl group attached to the benzene in position 4, and an amino group as well. But wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see: phenyl (C6H5), propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? Or is it CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2COO- as the ester. But the option says
