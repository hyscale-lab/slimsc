Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a spin-½ particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times S_z. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me start by recalling what I know. Spin-½ particles have spin angular momentum with components S_x, S_y, S_z. The magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin, so mu = gamma * S. Oh wait, in the problem, it's specified as mu equals gamma multiplied by S_z. So perhaps that's a specific scenario, maybe a magnetic field along Z initially. Because when the magnetic field is along a certain axis, the system's energy depends on the component of spin along that direction.

Initially, the magnetic field is in the +Z direction. The particle's magnetic moment will align with the field to minimize energy. So the system is in an eigenstate of S_z. But then the magnetic field is turned off and another is turned on along +Y. So now the field is along Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of mu.

Wait, mu is gamma times S_z. So the average of mu_z is gamma times the expectation value of S_z. So
