Okay, let's try to figure out the answers to these organic chemistry questions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll go through each part step by step.

So, the question has two parts, A and B. Let me look at each part separately.

**Part A: The reaction with BuLi and H+**

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw the structure to visualize it better. 

The benzene ring is attached to a (CH2O) group, where O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a substituent. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 3-methyl would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, but but has four carbons. Let me count: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, the substituent is at position 1, so the structure of the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. So the benzene is connected to O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, the 1-yl means the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-O-CH2-benzene? No, wait. Let me think again. The starting material is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So that's benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait
