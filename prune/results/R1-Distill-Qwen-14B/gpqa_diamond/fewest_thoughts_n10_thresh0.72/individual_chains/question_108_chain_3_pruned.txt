Okay, so I have this physics question about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They're talking about small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh right, m can be -1, 0, 1 for p orbitals, but wait, wait—no, I think for s orbitals, l=0, so m=0. For p, l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. Oh wait, the question says small m, so maybe m is 0? Or like m=1? Hmm, not sure yet.

The main point is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Zeeman effect term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy is given with a wavelength λ = 0.4861 μm. Wait, that's the Balmer series wavelength, maybe? Like the H-alpha line? Right, the Balmer-alpha transition is about 656 nm, but wait, 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm, which is actually the H-beta line. Or wait, no, Balmer-alpha is n=3 to n=2: 656 nm. Balmer-beta is n=4 to n=2: 486 nm. So yeah, the given wavelength is 486 nm. So the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference corresponding to this photon.

Wait, the problem is about the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy. So, the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman effect, which is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. The transition energy ΔE is the energy of the photon emitted during the transition. So we need to compare these two energies.

First, I need to calculate both values.

Let me start with ΔE. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. So, using Planck's constant h, speed of light c, and wavelength λ.

h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 0.4861
