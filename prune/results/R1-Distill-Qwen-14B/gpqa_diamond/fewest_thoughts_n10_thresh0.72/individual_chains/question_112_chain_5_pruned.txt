Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates of a given operator and also finding the average value of that operator. 

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. First, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the normalization. The state is a linear combination of the up and down spin states along the z-axis. 

Wait, the z-projection eigenstates are |up> and |down>, right. So the state |alpha> is written as a combination of these. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). To find the probabilities, I need to compute the squared magnitudes of these coefficients, but first, I should normalize the state.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2). So the square is 2. The magnitude of (2-i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5). So the square is 5. So the total norm is 2 +5 =7, right? So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). 

So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>. 

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if iâ‰ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with two states. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0     ]

Hmm. Wait, because when iâ‰ j, A_ij = hbar/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The operator's matrix is probably written in the basis of |up> and |down> states. So the
