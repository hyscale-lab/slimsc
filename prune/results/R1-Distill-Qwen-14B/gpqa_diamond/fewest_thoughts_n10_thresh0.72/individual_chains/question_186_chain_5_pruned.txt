Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically involves 1,5-dienes, right? The reaction occurs under thermal conditions, usually with heat, and it forms another 1,5-diene but in a different structure.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridge rings. So, the structure is like a norbornane. The substituents are at positions 1 and 4, with a vinyl group at carbon 2. Also, the bicyclo system has a double bond at position 5. Wait, no, wait. The compound is 2-vinyl and 5-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6 perhaps? Or maybe between 5 and another position. Let me think. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene would have the double bond in the 5 position, which is part of the bridge. So the structure has a bridge and a double bond there.

Wait, the numbering is a bit tricky. So, for bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6? Or maybe, considering the bridge structure, perhaps between 5 and 6 is a bridge. Let me recall: the bicyclo notation [x.y.z] refers to the number of carbons in each bridge. For [2.2.1], the largest bridge has two carbons, another has two, and the smallest has one. So the structure is like a norbornene, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, but here
