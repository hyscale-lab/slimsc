Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

The question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, which is an alkene with some substituents, I think I need to calculate the enthalpy change using bond energies.

Wait, the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is something like: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed)

But wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Because when bonds are broken, you're putting energy in (endothermic), and when bonds are formed, you're releasing energy (exothermic). So the equation should be: 

ΔH = (sum of energies of bonds broken) - (sum of energies of bonds formed)

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Bonds breaking require energy input, which is endothermic. Bonds forming release energy, which is exothermic. So the enthalpy change is the sum of the bond energies that are broken minus the sum of the bond energies that are formed. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Suppose you have a reaction where bonds are broken in the reactants and new bonds are formed in the products. The enthalpy change is calculated as:

ΔH = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when bonds are broken, you have to put in energy (endothermic), and when bonds form, you release energy (exothermic). So for the reaction:

Reactants → Products

The bonds in reactants break (energy used) and new bonds form in products (energy released). So the enthalpy change is the energy used minus the energy released. So:

ΔH = (energy required to break reactant bonds) - (energy released when forming product bonds)

Which can also be written as:

ΔH = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

Wait,
