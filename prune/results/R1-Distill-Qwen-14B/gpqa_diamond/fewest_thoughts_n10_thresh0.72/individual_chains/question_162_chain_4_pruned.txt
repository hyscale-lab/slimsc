Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions, right? Like, only x and y coordinates involved. So maybe it's a 2D manifold embedded in some way.

Wait, when I think of a pseudosphere, I remember that it's a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric probably represents a hyperbolic space, maybe like the Poincaré disk model. Oh right, the Poincaré disk has a metric similar to this, where the denominator depends on the radius squared minus the position squared.

The standard Poincaré disk metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), but wait, here the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Hmm, but 4 is like (2)^2, so maybe r=2 is the radius of the disk here. So the metric might be scaled differently.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, pseudosphere and sphere are terms that sometimes come up in different contexts. A pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, which can be represented in the Poincaré disk model. But the term here might be a bit confusing.

But the metric is given in 2D, so maybe it
