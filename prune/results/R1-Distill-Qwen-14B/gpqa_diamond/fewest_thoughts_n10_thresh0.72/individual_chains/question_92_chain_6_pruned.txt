Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let's try to break it down.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a pretty complex molecule with multiple substituents. I think I need to find the enthalpy of formation, which is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies. Oh right, enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies by considering the bonds broken in the reactants and formed in the products. The formula is something like: 

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of bonds formed)

But wait, no, wait. Actually, the enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when the compound is formed from its elements. So, the calculation might involve the standard enthalpy of atomization as well.

Wait another thing, maybe the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the given bond energies. Let me think about the steps.

First, the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) is calculated using the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔHf° = (Σ bond energies of bonds broken in the reactants) - (Σ bond energies of bonds formed in the products)

Wait, but in this case, the reactants are the elements
