Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again and see what it's asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of an operator P_z. The system is in a specific eigenstate of another operator P_x, and I need to calculate the uncertainty in P_z. The options are given, so I need to find out which one is correct.

First, let's understand the setup. The operators P_x, P_y, and P_z are given as 3x3 matrices. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That probably means that the eigenstates of P_z form the basis of the vector space we're working in. So, when a state is expressed as a column vector, those components are in the eigenbasis of P_z.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, this is the state |ψ> of the system.

I remember that the uncertainty of an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt< (A)^2 > - <A>^2, where A is the operator. But wait, in this case, I need to find ΔP_z, which is the uncertainty in the P_z operator. So, I need to compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared, then take the square root of their difference.

But wait, since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of P_z. So, when I calculate the expectation values, I'll have to apply the operator to the state and compute the inner products.

Let me write down the state vector. It's a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So, each component corresponds to the basis vectors of P_z. Let me denote the basis vectors as |1>, |2>, |3>, which are the eigenvectors of P_z with eigenvalues probably ħ, 0, -ħ as per the matrix given for P_z.

Looking at the matrix of P_z, it's diagonal:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

So, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. So, the basis vectors are |1> (corresponding to ħ), |2> (0), and |3> (-ħ).

The given state vector has components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, |ψ> is expressed in the |1>, |2>, |3> basis.

But wait, before I proceed, I should check if the state is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the components.

(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2
