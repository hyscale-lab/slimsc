Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity, nG, which is the relative entropy between the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau.

Wait, relative entropy, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence, right? So the formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. That makes sense because if rho is non-Gaussian, its entropy might be different.

But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state tau here? I think in the context of quantum states, a Gaussian state is a state whose Wigner function is Gaussian, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The cat states are superpositions of such states, making them non-Gaussian.

So the first step is to construct the density matrix rho for the given |psi>. Then, find the entropy of rho and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau.

But how do I find the entropy of rho? For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy is -trace(rho ln rho), but wait, if the state is pure, rho is a projection operator, so rho^2 = rho. But wait, the relative entropy here is del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)], where S is the von Neumann entropy. Oh wait, but the formula given is trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau). Wait, for pure states, rho is |psi><psi|, so rho^2 = rho. Then trace(rho ln rho) is -S(rho), but wait, wait, the von Neumann entropy is S(rho) = -trace(rho ln rho). So if del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is [ -S(rho) ) -
