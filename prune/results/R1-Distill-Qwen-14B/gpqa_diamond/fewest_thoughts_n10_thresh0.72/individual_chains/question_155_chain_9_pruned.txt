Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to calculate the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

But wait, the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Oh, that's important because measuring P_z in that basis is straightforward.

Let me write down the given information.

The operator matrices:

P_x is a 3x3 matrix. First row: [0, ħ/√2, 0]. Second row: [ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2]. Third row: [0, ħ/√2, 0].

P_y has elements with imaginary components. First row: [0, -iħ/√2, 0]. Second row: [iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2]. Third row: [0, iħ/√2, 0].

P_z matrix is diag(ħ, 0, -ħ). So its diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2 , 1/√2 , -1/2 ]^T.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ should just be the sum of the components multiplied by the P_z eigenvalues.

Wait, because each basis state |n> has P_z |n> = p_n |n>, where p_n is the eigenvalue. So in this case, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively.

So the state is a linear combination of these |n> states. So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |c_n|² * p_n, where c_n are the
