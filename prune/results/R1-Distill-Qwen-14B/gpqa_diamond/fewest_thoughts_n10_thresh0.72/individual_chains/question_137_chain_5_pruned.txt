Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's start from what I remember.

So, the question says that a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, T ≈ 0. It goes through two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, what's a synchrocyclotron? I think it's a type of particle accelerator that uses a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. Unlike a regular cyclotron, it can handle particles with varying speeds because the magnetic field isn't constant—I remember something about the magnetic field increasing as the particles gain energy. Oh right, because in a cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, but as particles gain speed, their mass increases relativistically, so the frequency changes. But synchrocyclotrons adjust the magnetic field to keep the cyclotron frequency constant.

But wait, the question is about the number of revolutions. So I need to find how many times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before reaching that kinetic energy.

I remember that in a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is related to the magnetic field. The formula for cyclotron frequency is f = (qB)/(2πm), but since in a synchrocyclotron B might be changing, maybe the frequency isn't constant. Hmm, but the problem states that the voltage is an alternating voltage, which suggests it's an RF wave. The frequency of the voltage must match the proton's cyclotron frequency at the time.

Wait, but the voltage U(t) is U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. So the frequency here is ν(α). I think that in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is kept in resonance with the particle's cyclotron frequency as it's being accelerated. Because the magnetic field increases, the cyclotron frequency would normally change, but by adjusting the magnetic field, the frequency can stay in tune with the applied RF.

But how does the number of revolutions relate to the energy gained?

Let me think about the energy gained. Each time the proton goes through the potential well of the electric
