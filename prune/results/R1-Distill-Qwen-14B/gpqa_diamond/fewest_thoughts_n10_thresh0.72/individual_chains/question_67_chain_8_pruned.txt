Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're supposed to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. The total l is 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the joint probability of both measurements being -ħ.

Wait, the orbital angular momentum operator is Lz, right? So each electron has an Lz value. For a single electron in a p orbital, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. Since each electron's orbital angular momentum quantum number is l=1, their m values can be -1, 0, +1.

But in this coupled state, the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>.

Hmm, I think the approach here is to look at the possible states that make up this coupled state and see the probability of each of them. Because when you measure L1z and L2z, you're essentially looking at the product states of individual m1 and m2 values.

Oh right! The coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> can be expressed as a combination of product states |m1, m2>. So each product state is |m1> |m2>, and the coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, I think.

The state we have is |1,1,2,-1>. We need to express this in terms of the product states. So what are the possible (m1, m2) combinations that sum up to m = -1?

Each m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So adding m1 and m2 to get -1:

Possible pairs: (-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 0)? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because m1 + m2 needs to equal the total m, which is -1 here.

Wait, let's think: m can be from m1 + m2. So possible pairs (m1, m2) that sum to m=-1.

Possible combinations:
- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1
- m1 = 1, m2 = -2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1, so m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So that's not possible.

Wait, another approach. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1, and same for m2. So for each possible m1, m2, what's their sum?

We need m1 + m2 = -1.

So for m1 = -1: m2 must be 0
