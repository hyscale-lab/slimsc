Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me read it again. The question gives a Lagrangian interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I misread that. Oh right, I think it's written as -λ f f-bar ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, the interaction term is ψ_f^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, no, wait. Let me parse that correctly. The term looks like -λ times f times psi_f bar times psi_f times (v+X), but that doesn't make much sense dimensionally. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct term is something like -λ X f ψ_f bar ψ_f, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the Lagrangian is written as -λ f X ψ_f bar ψ_f. Or perhaps it's a Yukawa-like coupling, where the boson X couples to a fermion ψ_f with some coupling strength λ. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that X couples to fermions, which allows it to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

So the problem is about the allowed decay products of the X boson. Since X has a mass of 6 GeV, the decay products must each have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Let me think about the possible fermions. Fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos). But wait, neutrinos are very light, so including them would require considering their masses. However, in many cases, neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass, but in some models, they might have a non-zero mass. But for the sake of this problem, I'll probably assume neutrinos are massless.

So for a decay X → f f-bar, the rest mass of the ferm
