Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |ψ> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). 

The relative entropy measure is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state. We need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. The options are A to D, with some numerical values.

Hmm, okay. So first, I recall that Gaussian states are those that have a density matrix that's Gaussian, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by a Gaussian Wigner function, and they're important in quantum optics and quantum information because they're useful for certain tasks like quantum computing.

The non-Gaussianity here is measured using relative entropy, which is a way to quantify how different the state is from the most similar Gaussian state. The relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated as the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state rho and the Gaussian state tau that is closest to it in terms of this measure.

Wait, but wait. How do I approach this? Let me think about the steps I need to take.

First, I need to find the density matrix rho for the given state |ψ>. Then, find the reference Gaussian state tau that is the closest to rho in the relative entropy sense. Then compute del_b as [S(rho) - S(tau)], where S is the von Neumann entropy.

But wait, wait. Maybe there's a simpler way. I've heard that for certain states, like the Schrödinger cat state, the non-Gaussianity can be computed using specific formulas. Alternatively, perhaps
