Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, the problem is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has this anti-nutritional compound. The gene for that compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for a mutation that would eliminate the compound.

The question gives the sequences of the intact gene and four mutants (1-4). The question is asking which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, probably, we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the protein structure significantly.

Looking at the options, all the mutants have changes in the first exon area. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, let me align them. The first part: the intact gene is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT... So, in Mutant 1, the sequence is ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC... Wait, no, let me check:

No, wait. The first part of the intact gene is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, let's compare each nucleotide. Starting from the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, looking at each position:

Positions 1-3: same (ATG).
Positions 4-6: TTT in intact, TCT in mutant1? Wait, no. Let me parse it correctly.

Wait,
