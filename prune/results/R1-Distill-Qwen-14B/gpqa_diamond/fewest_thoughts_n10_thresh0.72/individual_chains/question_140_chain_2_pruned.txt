Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question says: Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is about 277 K, which under normal conditions is close to room temperature, maybe a bit lower. Then, there's a part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's noted that X and its analogs are used for that. Then, we need to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about Substance X. It incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X is probably a compound where one of its elements has an isotope that's heavier than the standard. Maybe something with isotopes like chlorine, which has both 35Cl and 37Cl.

When X reacts with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So, for a molecule, each atom's neutrons and protons contribute. But wait, the molecule as a whole has same number of neutrons and protons? Or each atom in the molecule? Hmm.

Wait, the question says "the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So for the whole molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons.

So, what gas could that be? Let me think. Common gases: H2, O2, N2, CO2, NH3, H2O, maybe others. Let's see.

If W is H2: each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal.

CO2: each CO2 molecule has 2 O atoms. Let's calculate. Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (assuming it's C-12, but could be others). Each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (if O-16). So CO2: 1 C and 2 O. Protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. So 22 each. That fits. So W could be CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas. Another option: H2O. H2O: each molecule has 2 H (each 1p, 0n) and 1 O (8p, 8n). So protons: 2 +8 =10. Neutrons: 0 +8=8. Not equal.

Another option: CH4. Wait, but CH4 is a gas too. Its protons: C has 6, each H has 1. So 6 + 4=10. Neutrons: C has
