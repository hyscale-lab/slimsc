Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the structure of this unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Let me start by going through each piece of information one by one and see what I can deduce.

First, looking at the Mass Spectrometry data: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity, and there's a peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, molecular ion peaks usually correspond to the molecular weight of the compound. So the molecular weight is 156. But wait, there's an additional peak at 158. That's a molecular ion plus two mass units. Maybe this is due to something like a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a common isotope at around 35Cl (about 75%) and 37Cl (about 25%). So if the molecule has a chlorine atom, the molecular ion would have peaks at M and M+2. Let me calculate: M (156) and M+2 (158). So the molecular formula probably includes a Cl atom. That makes sense because 32% is roughly 32/100, which is about a third. Since chlorine has a 75/25 isotope ratio, the M+2 peak would be about (0.25 * 100%) =25% of the M peak. But here, the M is 100%, and M+2 is 32%. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps the total is not just the Cl isotopes. Maybe there are other factors? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the percentages. Let me think. The intensity of the M+2 peak is 32% of the M peak. Chlorine's isotopic abundance is about 25% for 37Cl. So for a molecule with one Cl, the M peak is 75% abundance, and the M+2 is 25%. But in the data, M is 100%, so perhaps the Cl is part of a larger structure, but maybe there's another factor. Alternatively, maybe there's more than one Cl? Or maybe not Cl. Wait, let me not get stuck here yet. Let me look at the other data.

The IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like from a hydroxyl group. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an amine or maybe an alcohol. But looking at the other IR peak: a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typical for a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, but it's also broad due to the -OH. So in this case, the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which suggests O-H, and
