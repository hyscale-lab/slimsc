Okay, so I've got this problem here about a supermassive black hole and calculating its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, entropy of a black hole... Oh right, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The formula is S = (A * ħ c^3)/(4 G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. But I remember that A is proportional to the square of the Schwarzschild radius, so A = 4π R_s². And R_s is 2 G M / c². So the area depends on the mass of the black hole.

But wait, the question gives me the angular size θ. So maybe I can find the actual size of the event horizon from that. Oh right, the angular size is the apparent size from a distance. The formula relating angular size (in radians) θ is approximately θ ≈ size / distance, when θ is small. So size = θ * distance.

Wait, but θ is given in degrees. I need to convert that to radians because the formula uses radians. So 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is (1e-17 degrees) * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17
