Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about dissolving iron hydroxide and figuring out the volume of acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed, and then find the pH of the resulting solution.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, right? So to dissolve it, we need to add a strong acid. The acid will react with the Fe(OH)3. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl, it should donate H+ ions.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. Let me calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Wait, each OH group is 17 g/mol (16+1). So:

Fe:55.85
3(OH): 3*(17) =51
Total:55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936, yes.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with a strong acid, like HCl, it should produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and Cl- ions. The reaction equation should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, yeah, because each OH- in Fe(OH)3 will react with H+ from the acid. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so it needs three H+ ions per formula unit.

So the moles of H+ required are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. Moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.000936 mol, so H+ needed is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

But wait, the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed (V) is moles of H+ divided by concentration (M = mol/L). So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280
