Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction patterns created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says the aperture is shaped like a N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ along the z-axis falls on this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh right, and we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, so first, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So in that case, the problem reduces to the diffraction pattern from a circular aperture. 

I remember that for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk), and the first minima occur at certain angles. The formula for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by sinθ = (1.22) λ / (π a), wait no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. Oh right, for the single-slit diffraction, the first minimum is at sinθ = λ/(a), but that's for a slit of width 'a'. But wait, for a circular aperture, it's a bit different.

Wait no, for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima are given by the roots of the Bessel functions. The first minimum occurs at θ where J₁(π a sinθ / λ ) = 0. Or wait, maybe the argument is (π a sinθ)/λ. So the first zero of the Bessel function J₁ is at around 3.8317, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the minima occur when the derivative of the Bessel function is zero? Or when the Bessel function itself is zero.

Wait, for circular diffraction, the intensity minima occur when the Bessel function's first derivative is zero? No, I think that's for maxima. Hmm, maybe I should get this right. The intensity in the far field for a circular aperture is given by the square of the Bessel function J₁, but wait, no. Wait, the formula is I = (sin(x)/x)^2, where x is (π a sinθ)/λ. But wait, that
