Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the uncertainty principle, right? I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle. Oh wait, the question says the electron is moving at a speed v, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is given. They want the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Alright, so the problem states that the electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v = 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its location is Δx = 0.1 nm. I need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, I think I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s.

So, the momentum p is mass times velocity. The electron's mass is about 9.11e-31 kg. So, if I can find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum, I can relate that to ΔE.

But how does the uncertainty in momentum relate to the uncertainty in energy? Hmm, I think that the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so maybe the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum. Alternatively, perhaps we're using the time-energy uncertainty principle, but I'm not too sure. Wait, the problem asks for the minimum uncertainty in energy, so maybe it's about the energy uncertainty due to the momentum uncertainty.

Let me think: the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m). So, the uncertainty in E would be the derivative of E with respect to p times Δp. Wait, that's the approach using error propagation. So, ΔE = |dE/dp| * Δp. Since E = p²/(2m), dE/dp is p/m. So, ΔE = (p/m) * Δp.

Wait, but I have v, not p. But since p = mv, I can express p as m*v. So, substituting, ΔE = (mv/m) * Δp = v * Δp. Oh, that's interesting.

So, ΔE = v * Δp. But wait, I don't know Δp yet. Oh right, from the uncertainty principle, Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx). Wait, no, the uncertainty principle says Δp Δx ≥ ħ/2, so the minimum uncertainty for Δp is ħ/(2Δx). So, taking Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

So putting it all together, ΔE ≈ v * (ħ/(2Δx)).

Let me plug in the numbers.

v is 2e8 m/s. ħ is 1.05e-34 J·s. Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters.

So, calculate Δp first: ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34)/(2 * 0.1e-9) = (1.05e-34)/(2e-10) → 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05/2) * 1e-24 → approx 0.525e-24 → 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Then, ΔE = v * Δp = (2e8 m/s) * (5.25e-25 kg·m/s) = 2e8 * 5.25e-25.

Calculating that: 2 * 5.25 = 10.5; 1e8 * 1e-25 = 1e-17. So, 10.5e-17 J → 1.05e-16 J. Hmm, that's about 1e-16 J. But wait, that's not matching the options exactly. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute it step by step.

Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 m = 1e-10 m.

Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) → 1.05e-34 / (2 * 1e-10) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 → (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24 → 0.525e-24 ≈ 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

v = 2e8 m/s.

ΔE = v * Δp = (2e8)(5.25e-25) → 2 *5.25 = 10.5 → 10.5e-17 → 1.05e-16 J. So that's 1.05e-16 J, which is about ~1e-16 J.

Looking at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J. But wait, that's a very high value for an electron's energy uncertainty. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the kinetic energy formula more carefully. Let me think again.

Another approach: The uncertainty in kinetic energy could be linked to the uncertainty in momentum via the relation E = p²/(2m). So, the uncertainty ΔE would be approximately (p/m) Δp. But p is mv, so that becomes v Δp. So same as before.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me see. The uncertainty principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So, the minimum Δp is ħ/(2Δx). I used that correctly.

Wait, let me recompute the numbers.

Δp = ħ/(2Δx) → (1.05e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9) → denominator is 2e-10.

So 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24 → 0.525e-24 → 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

v = 2e8 m/s.

ΔE = v * Δp = 2e8 * 5.25e-25 → 2 *5.25 = 10.5 → 10.5e-17 J.

Wait, 10.5e-17 is 1.05e-16 J. Again, same result.

So that would correspond to option D) ~1e-16 J.

Wait, but why is this the case? The options include much smaller values, like 1e-18 J, which is three orders of magnitude smaller. Maybe I made a mistake in exponents.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 m = 1e-10 m.

So, Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) → 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05 / 2 ) * 1e-24 → 0.525 * 1e-24 → 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

v = 2e8 m/s.

ΔE = v * Δp = 2e8 * 5.25e-25.

Multiply 2e8 by 5.25e-25: 2 *5.25 =10.5; 1e8 * 1e-25 = 1e-17. So 10.5e-17 = 1.05e-16 J. So yeah, that's 1e-16 J.

Wait, but that seems high. I thought the energy uncertainty would be lower. Maybe I'm missing a factor? Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy? But the speed is 2e8 m/s, which is about 66% the speed of light (since c is 3e8 m/s). Hmm, that's a significant fraction. So relativistic effects might be important.

Wait, but the non-relativistic approach for kinetic energy is E = (p²)/(2m). But if v is 2e8, which is greater than (c/2), maybe the non-relativistic formula isn't accurate. But perhaps the question expects us to use the non-relativistic approach regardless.

Wait, another thought: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle gives the minimum uncertainty, so perhaps the calculation we did is the correct approach. If that's the case, the answer would be D) ~1e-16 J.

But looking at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J. So, according to my calculation, that's the correct answer. But let me check the exponents again.

Wait, let me make sure about the numbers. 1e-34 divided by 2e-10 is 5e-25 (approximately). 5e-25 multiplied by 2e8 is 1e-17. Wait, wait, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, 2e8 is 2 * 10^8, and 5.25e-25 is 5.25 * 10^-25.

Multiply them: 2 *5.25 = 10.5; 10^8 * 10^-25 = 10^-17. So 10.5e-17 = 1.05e-16 J. So that's 1.05e-16 J, which is ~1e-16 J, option D.

Wait, but another approach: Perhaps instead of taking ΔE as vΔp, I should think in terms of the energy uncertainty from the momentum uncertainty. Because kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be approximately (2p/(2m)) Δp = (p/m) Δp. Since p = mv, p/m = v. So again, same result.

So I think the calculation is correct. So the answer is D.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between momentum and energy.

### Step 1: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states:
\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]
where \( \hbar = 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Solving for \( \Delta p \), the minimum uncertainty in momentum is:
\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

### Step 2: Substituting Values
Given \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:
\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 0.525 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 5.25 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Relating Momentum Uncertainty to Energy Uncertainty
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by \( E = \frac{p^2}{2m} \), where \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) can be approximated as:
\[
\Delta E = \left| \frac{dE}{dp} \right| \cdot \Delta p.
\]
Since \( \frac{dE}{dp} = \frac{p}{m} \), and \( p = mv \), we find:
\[
\Delta E = v \cdot \Delta p.
\]

### Step 4: Substituting Values for \( \Delta E \)
Using \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \Delta p = 5.25 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):
\[
\Delta E = (2 \times 10^8) \cdot (5.25 \times 10^{-25}) = 10.5 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J} = 1.05 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 5: Comparing with Options
The calculated uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 1.05 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **D** (\( \sim 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \)).

### Final Answer:
The minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately \( 1.05 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \), matching option **D**.
