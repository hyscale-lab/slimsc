Okay, so I have this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. So, the 1S0 notation—wait, I remember that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, 2S+1 is 2*1 +1 = 3. So it's ^3S_0. That means the total spin S is 1, orbital angular momentum L is 0 (since S is the spectroscopic symbol for orbital angular momentum—wait, no, wait. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So in 1S0, S is 1, L is 0, and J is 0. So J = L + S, but since L is 0, J can only be S, so 1. Wait, but the term is 1S0, meaning J=0? That's confusing because S is 1 and L is 0, so J can be 1 or -1, but since it's total angular momentum, it's |L + S|=1. Wait, but the term is given as 1S0, so J is 0. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, perhaps the initial state is 1S0, which is the same as S=0? No, wait the term symbol (2S+1
