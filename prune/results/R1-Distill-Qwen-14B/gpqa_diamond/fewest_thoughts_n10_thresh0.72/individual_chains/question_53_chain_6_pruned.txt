Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. Alright, the question is about an unknown di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that's a clue. The NMR spectrum has several signals, and I need to figure out the molecular formula from that.

First, let's break down the information given. The compound is di-substituted, so the aromatic ring has two substituents. The FTIR has ester peaks, which typically show a strong absorption around 1740-1720 cm^-1 due to the carbonyl group in the ester. So, there's definitely an ester functional group present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's categorize them. Two are aromatic-H, two are vinyl-H (one doublet, the other a doublet of quartets), and two are -CH3 groups. No signals from -CH2 groups, so the structure doesn't have any methylene groups.

So, thinking about the aromatic ring, it's a six-membered ring with two substituents. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents can be in positions that are either ortho, meta, or para to each other. But the NMR signals for aromatic-H are two. Wait, wait, in a para-substituted benzene, you usually have two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each a doublet. But if the substituents are para, the ring's protons would split into two signals, each integrating for two protons each. Alternatively, if the substituents are in meta positions, the aromatic protons might show more splitting, but maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, but the question says two signals for aromatic-H. So each signal must correspond to a set of equivalent protons. If the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para-xylene, you have two sets of aromatic protons, each as a singlet. But wait, no, in para-xylene, the protons are in two sets of two equivalent each, so each would be a singlet if the coupling is not observed, but in NMR, they might split each other. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.
