Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure out the probability that a particular atom will decay within the next 150 minutes, given that it's already been 50 minutes since we started monitoring and it hasn't decayed yet. Hmm, let me think.

Wait, so the decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. Oh right, that means that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%, since 100% minus 32% is 68%. 

But wait, the question is about the next 150 minutes, but we've already waited 50 minutes. So the total time we're considering is 200 minutes (50 + 150). But wait, no. Because the decay probability given is for 100 minutes, but we're starting fresh at 50 minutes. No, wait, no. Wait, the question says, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Oh right, so the initial 50 minutes are over, and now we're looking for the next 150.

Wait, but radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the decay probability doesn't depend on the time already elapsed. That's the key here. Because each atom has a constant probability per unit time of decaying, regardless of how much time has passed. So the fact that it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes doesn't affect the probabilities for the next period. 

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the decay probability given is for 100 minutes, which is a specific time interval. So maybe the decay process follows an exponential decay, meaning the probability of decay in a certain time is independent of when you start. So the probability of decay in the next T minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed, as long as the decay hasn't happened yet.

So let me rephrase. The initial statement says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. That suggests that the decay follows an exponential model. So the formula for the probability of decay in time t is P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

But wait, the given 32% is for 100 minutes. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me solve for λ.

Wait, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ), so e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately, well, ln(0.7) is about -0.356, but 0.68 is slightly less than 0.7. Let me calculate ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. So the probability of decay in that time would be P = 1 - e^(-λ * 150). Let's compute that.

So λ is about 0.0038566. 150 * λ = 150 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.57849.

So e^(-0.57849) is approximately... Let me think, e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488, e^(-0.57849) would be between these. Maybe around 0.561? Let's calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.57849 is approximately 0.578. Let me use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can calculate it step by step.

But perhaps I can compute e^(-0.57849) using the Taylor series or approximate values. Alternatively, use the fact that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. Hmm, maybe not helpful here.

Alternatively, I'll just proceed. Let's say e^(-0.578) ≈ 0.561. So 1 - 0.561 is about 0.439, which is approximately 43.9%. So that's about 44%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%, option C is 52%, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: since the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is what's being asked, but the initial 100 minutes had a 32% chance. The 150 minutes is longer than 100, so the decay probability should be higher than 32%. But according to my calculation, it's about 44%, which is higher than 32%—that makes sense because 150 is longer than 100.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Is the initial 100 minutes part of the 150? No, because the 50 minutes have already passed. Oh, wait, no. The decay could have happened in the first 100 minutes, but it didn't. Wait, the total time we're looking at now is the next 150 minutes. So perhaps the 150 minutes is in addition to the initial 50. Wait, but the 150 minutes is the time frame we're considering now, after the 50 minutes. So the total time that could have passed is 200 minutes, but the decay could have happened any time in the 200. But since it hasn't decayed in the first 50, now we're looking at the next 150.

Wait, but no, the model is that the decay is memoryless. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the initial 150 minutes. So the time elapsed before doesn't affect the probability in the next period. So the 50-minute period is just part of the past and doesn't influence the future probability.

So in that case, the probability for the next 150 minutes is just 1 - e^(-λ * 150), which we calculated as approximately 44%.

So looking at the options, option A is 44%. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, another way to calculate λ: from the initial condition. P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural log, -100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then for 150 minutes: e^(-λ *150) = e^(-0.0038566 *150) = e^(-0.57849). Let's compute this more accurately.

We can calculate 0.57849. e^-0.5 is approximately 0.6065, e^-0.57 is about? Let's see, using a calculator-like approach.

e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + ...

But x is -0.57849. Let me compute e^(-0.57849).

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate this. Let me think, e^(-0.578) is approximately 0.561, as I thought before. So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, so approximately 44%.

So the answer should be option A, 44%. But wait, another approach: perhaps the 32% is for 100 minutes, so the decay constant λ can be found, and then the probability for 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ * 150). So that's the same approach as before.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute e^(-0.57849) more accurately. Let me use the fact that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931.

Wait, 0.57849 is about 0.5785. Hmm, wait, 0.5785 is less than ln(2), which is about 0.6931, so e^(-0.5785) is greater than 0.5, because e^(-ln(2)) is 0.5.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator table. But without a calculator, perhaps I can think of this as e^-0.578 ≈ 0.561, as I thought before. So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, so 43.9%, which is approximately 44%.

So the correct answer is A) 44%? Wait, but looking at the options again:

Options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ is given by 32% = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So λ = (-ln(0.68))/100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, for 150 minutes, the probability is 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150).

0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.561, so 1 - 0.561 is 0.439, which is 43.9%, so about 44%, which is option A.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, so the half-life can be calculated. Wait, the half-life T_1/2 is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay. The relation between λ and T_1/2 is λ = ln(2)/T_1/2.

So from the given data: P(100) = 0.32. So P = 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ)=0.68 → λ = (ln(0.68))/(-100).

As before, λ ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

So the half-life T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ ≈ 0.6931 / 0.0038566 ≈ 180 minutes.

Wait, because ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.6931 divided by 0.0038566 is about 180 minutes.

So the half-life is 180 minutes. That means that after 180 minutes, half the atoms would have decayed.

Now, the problem states that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, but the next 150 minutes is 150 minutes from now, starting at t=50. So the total time from the start would be 200 minutes.

But since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as it would be starting from t=0, because the probability depends only on the time period you're considering, not the time already elapsed.

Wait, wait, no. Because the decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is equal to the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval. So yes, it's the same as when starting fresh.

So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈ 0.439, so 44%, option A.

But wait, let me compute it with the half-life approach. Since the half-life is 180 minutes, then in 150 minutes, the fraction decayed is 150/180 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333. So the probability of decay is 1 - (1/2)^(150/180) = 1 - (1/2)^(5/6).

Calculating (1/2)^(5/6) is the same as 2^(-5/6). Let's compute that.

We can write 2^(1/6) is approximately 1.12246, so 2^(5/6) ≈ (1.12246)^5 ≈ approximately 1.7818.

Wait, wait. Wait, 2^(5/6) is 2^(0.8333). Let me compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using natural logs:

ln(2^(5/6)) = (5/6)*ln(2) ≈ (5/6)*0.6931 ≈ 0.57758. So e^0.57758 ≈ 1.7818.

Wait, but wait, no. Because 2^(5/6) is equal to e^{(5/6) ln 2}. So that's correct.

But wait, no, that's the value of 2^(5/6). Which is about 1.7818. So (1/2)^(5/6) is 1/1.7818 ≈ 0.561. So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%. So again, 44% as the probability, which matches the previous calculation.

So the answer should be A)44%.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the question is considering the decay as a fixed probability per 100 minutes, so 32% in 100 minutes. Then, would the probability in 150 minutes be 32% multiplied by 1.5, which is 48%? But that doesn't fit because radioactive decay probabilities don't work that way. Because the chance doesn't add linearly. So that's probably incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the use of the formula for radioactive decay, which is continuous, not a fixed percentage over a specific time. So the initial approach with the exponential is correct.

So I think the correct answer is A)44%.


To determine the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, we use the principles of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential model. The decay probability for a given time interval is independent of the time already elapsed, as radioactive decay is a memoryless process.

The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, meaning the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%. Using the exponential decay formula:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

we can solve for the decay constant \(\lambda\). For \(t = 100\) minutes and \(P(100) = 0.32\):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Approximating \(\ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566\), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

Now, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the same formula:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \(\lambda = 0.0038566\) and \(t = 150\):

\[
-150\lambda = -150 \cdot 0.0038566 \approx -0.57849
\]

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.561
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 \approx 0.439
\]

This corresponds to a probability of approximately 43.9%, which rounds to 44%. Therefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is **44%**.
