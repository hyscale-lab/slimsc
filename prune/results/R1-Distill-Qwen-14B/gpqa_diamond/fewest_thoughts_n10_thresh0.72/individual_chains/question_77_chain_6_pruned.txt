Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about the Cope rearrangement, which I remember is a reaction involving 1,5-dienes. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to find out what the major products are for each, and then match them with the given options.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. I think that's a bit of a mouthful. Let's draw it out. So the benzene ring has a substituent that's an ethoxy group, but wait, noâ€” the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy methyl. Wait, no, the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl) attached to benzene. So the benzene has a group like OCH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, not quite. Let me think: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is the substituent attached to the oxygen. The but-2-en-1-yl group would be CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the 1 position. So the structure would be: the oxygen is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, maybe I should write it as: benzene-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no. Wait, the structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl). So the group is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait. Let me think of the substituent as but-2-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CH3? No, wait, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy,
