Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. Let me think, the molecule rearranges when heated or exposed to light.

The first part of the question is about a reaction involving ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+. I think BuLi is a strong base, a butyllithium, so it's probably deprotonating something. Wait, in the presence of a diene, maybe it's forming an enolate or something. Oh wait, the molecule has an ether group, OMe attached to a benzene ring. The structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy group attached to a methyl group on benzene. So it's like Ph-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2- but wait, no. Let me draw it.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a 3-methyl, so the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-. So the group is OCH2-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait: the substit
