Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, which are nuclei of heavy atoms. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Oh wait, and X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. When particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases significantly due to relativistic effects. I remember the formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated using the formula 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, because when v is a significant fraction of c, gamma becomes much larger than 1. Here, v is 0.96c, which is pretty close to the speed of light.

Let me calculate gamma first. So v = 0.96c. Plugging into gamma:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)² / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that sqrt part. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes, so sqrt(0.0784) is indeed 0.28. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a mass of approximately 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are about the same, around 939 MeV/c
