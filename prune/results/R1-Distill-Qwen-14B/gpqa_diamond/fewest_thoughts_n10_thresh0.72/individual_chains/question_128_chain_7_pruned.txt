Okay, so I just landed this awesome job at a structural biology lab at Stanford. The first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence and four plasmid options. I need to figure out which plasmid to use. Hmm, let's think this through.

First, I remember that when expressing proteins in E. coli, the plasmid must have the correct coding sequence. Also, E. coli uses its own translation machinery, so the plasmid should have the gene in frame with the right ribosome binding sites. Oh right, and the gene should be under a promoter that E. coli recognizes, like the T7 promoter, which BL21 strains often use because they have the T7 RNA polymerase.

Looking at the options, all the plasmids start with ATG, which is the start codon. So that's good. But the sequences vary after that. Wait, maybe I should check for the presence of a T7 promoter. The T7 promoter is usually a specific sequence, like a certain arrangement of bases before the start codon.

Let me look at each option's beginning. The first part of the sequence is the same for all. They all start with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAG... Wait, but wait, the T7 promoter is typically upstream of the start codon. So the plasmid's sequence should have the T7 promoter before the ATG.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, in the plasmid sequences
