Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Let's see what I remember from my studies.

The problem states that the equilibrium temperatures and masses of the planets are given. The albedo is the same for all three, which is 0.3. I think albedo doesn't affect the orbital period directly, but it does play a role in equilibrium temperature. 

First, equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature (Te) is Te = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. So the formula is Te = T_eff * (L / (16πσ a² (1 - A)))^0.25. But maybe a simpler form for the ratio.

Wait, since all three planets orbit the same star, their equilibrium temperatures relate inversely to the square root of their orbital distances. Because if star's luminosity and planet's albedo are same, then Te ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio of temperatures Te1/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Oh wait wait, wait. Because Te is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4), so if L and A are same, Te1/Te2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). So Te1/Te2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So a2/a1 = (Te1/Te2)^2. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let's get this right. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = [ (L * (1 - A)) / (16 * π * σ * a²) ) ]^0.25

So if I take the ratio of Te1 to Te2, since L and A are the same for both, it's (Te1/Te2) = sqrt( sqrt( a2² / a1² )) ) Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

Expressing the ratio:

Te1/Te2 = [ ( (1/(a1^2) ) / (1/(a2^2)) ) ]^0.25 * (1 - A)^0.5 / (
