Okay, so I have this question about redshift and detecting quasars with clouds of neutral hydrogen. Hmm, I remember that redshift has to do with how the wavelength of light stretches as objects move away from us. The question mentions Lyman alpha wavelength, which I think is around 1216 Angstrom. Wait, isn't the Lyman alpha emission line in the ultraviolet? So if that's being absorbed by hydrogen clouds, it must be related to how that wavelength shifts.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes typically observe in the visible range, right? So the light we're detecting must be shifted into the visible spectrum. The Lyman alpha wavelength is in the UV, so if the cloud is moving away, the wavelength would be stretched into the optical.

Let me think about the formula for redshift. Oh right, the redshift z is given by (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength)/emitted wavelength. So z = (位_obs - 位_emit)/位_emit.

The emitted wavelength (位_emit) here is 1216 Angstrom for Lyman alpha. The observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range. Wait, what's the range of optical wavelengths? I think it's roughly from 400 to 700 nm, but wait, that's in nanometers. Oh, wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm
