Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

Hmm, di-substituted aromatic ring. So the ring has two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8. The ring itself is a benzene ring (6 carbons), so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Wait, but di-substituted means two groups attached to the ring. Each substituent can have multiple carbons. Let me think about that.

Wait, benzene has 6 carbons. If the substituents add up to 2, that could mean two substituents each with one carbon, like two methyl groups. But wait, the question says the compound has 8 carbons in total. So 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. So each substituent must be one carbon. Because 6 + 2 = 8.

Wait, that can't be right. Because substituents like -Cl (for example) don't add a carbon. Oh, wait, no, the substituents could be groups like -OCH3, which would add a carbon (the methyl in the OCH3). Or maybe -COOH (which has two carbons, but that's a possibility). Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Wait, but in the question, the IR shows a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, the FTIR has peaks indicating a carbonyl (like a C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like C-Cl or C-Br). So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. So two substituents on the benzene ring: one is a halogen (like Cl, Br), and the other is a carbonyl group, maybe as an acyl group or something else.

The carbonyl group could be part of a ketone, ester, or another carbonyl-containing functional group. So let's think about possible structures.

Wait, the ring has 6
