Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I need to figure out the relationship between the effective temperatures of the two stars based on the given information.

Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh, right, this relates to the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states at thermal equilibrium. Since the photospheres are in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can use that.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the energy levels as E1 and E2. Wait, but the question says the energy difference is between the considered levels. Let me assume that E1 is the higher energy level than E2. So the excitation is about how the atoms are in E1 relative to E2.

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, n1 = 2 * n2, where n is the population of the excited state. But wait, no, wait. Because star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So for each star, the ratio of excited atoms to the ground state would be different. Or maybe I should model it as the ratio of excited to non-excited being twice as high in star_1.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excited state population to the ground state is given. Let's say that in star_1, the ratio is R1, and in star_2, it's R2. The problem says R1 = 2 * R2.

So R1 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Since g_upper/g_lower is the same for both stars because the energy levels are the same for
