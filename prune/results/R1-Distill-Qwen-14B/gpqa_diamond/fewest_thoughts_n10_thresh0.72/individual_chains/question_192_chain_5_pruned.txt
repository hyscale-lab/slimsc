Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The setup: there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields. When a conductor is neutral, any charges placed inside a cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh wait, right, if the conductor is uncharged, the charges inside the cavity will induce equal and opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. 

Wait, so the conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. When +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q. 

But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q so that the total is zero. 

Now, for the electric field outside the conductor. I remember that the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor. Since the outer surface has +q, the field outside should be as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the formula should be similar to that of a point charge, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. 

Wait, but I'm confused because the charge is inside the cavity, which is offset from the center. Would that affect the external field? Oh, right! For points outside the conductor, the distribution of the charge on the outer surface doesn't matter because the
