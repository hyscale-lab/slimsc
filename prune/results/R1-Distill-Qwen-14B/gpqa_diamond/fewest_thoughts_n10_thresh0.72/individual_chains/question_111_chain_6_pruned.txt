Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions to complete, and we need to choose the major products A and B from the options given. So, reaction A is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as a base. Reaction B is between 1-nitropropane and KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. The options give different products for A and B, and I need to pick the right combination.

Let me start with reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. I imagine the structure: cyclohexanone with substituents. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1 (so that's the carbonyl group). At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, but wait, positions 2 and 6 are both substituted. So, the numbering is such that position 1 is the ketone, 2 is ethyl, and 6 is methyl. Wait, but in cyclohexane, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6 are adjacent in a ring. So the substituents at 2 and 6 would be opposite each other? Or no, because cyclohexane can have axial and equatorial positions. But maybe that's getting too detailed for now.

The reagent is ethyl acrylate, which is an acrylate ester. I think this is a Michael acceptor, but wait, wait. Alternatively, in the presence of a base like t-BuOK, it's possible that an enolate is formed. Oh right, cyclohexanone derivatives can undergo enolate formation. So maybe this is a Claisen-like condensation or something else? Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition, like a Michael addition.

Wait, ethyl acrylate is CHâ‚‚=CHCOOEt. So when the base, t-BuOK, is present, it could deprotonate the cyclohexanone to form an enolate. The enolate would attack the acrylate. Alternatively, maybe the acrylate is acting as a Michael acceptor, and the enolate as the nucleophile.

So the cyclohexanone would form an enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. Then, the acrylate's alpha, beta-unsaturated ester could undergo a conjugate addition. The enolate would attack the beta position (the less substituted end) of the acrylate. Alternatively, it could be an aldol addition if the carbonyl is the electrophilic part, but in this case, the enolate is the nucleophile.

Wait, let me think about the structure. The cyclohexanone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So the carbonyl is at position 1, and the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. Position 2 has an ethyl group, position 6 has a methyl. So the cyclohexanone would have substituents at 2 and 6. The formation of the enolate would occur at position 2 or 6, but where is more probable?

Wait, the carbonyl is at position 1. So the alpha carbons are positions 2 and 6. So the base would abstract a proton from either position 2 or 6. But in 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, positions 2 and 6 have substituents. Let's think about the structure. Position 2 has an ethyl group, position 6 has a methyl. So, the substituents at 2 and 6 are both in the ring.

Which position is more acidic? The alpha hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. The acidity depends on the stability of the enolate. The
