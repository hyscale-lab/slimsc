Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the data given includes mass, IR, and 1H NMR. Let's go through each one.

First, the mass spectrum: there's a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%) and another at 158 (32%). That second peak might be a fragment or an isotope. Wait, 158 is two units higher than 156. Oh, could that be Cl? Because Cl has a mass of about 35, but wait, wait. Chlorine has two main isotopes: 35Cl (about 75%) and 37Cl (25%). So if the molecular ion is at 156 and a peak at 158, that suggests the molecule contains a Cl atom. Because when Cl is present, the molecular ion would have isotopic peaks. So, the molecular weight is around 156, and the presence of Cl.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Could be a carboxylic acid (which has a broad O-H stretch) or an alcohol. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That region is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For example, ketones, aldehydes, esters, acids, or amides. The sharpness suggests maybe it's not a strong hydrogen bonding environment, so perhaps an ester or acid? Or maybe a chloroformate?

Looking at the NMR now. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 11.0 ppm, which is a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a very high chemical shift. What gives that? Carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, but they can be broad. Wait, but in this case, it's a singlet, so maybe it's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe an acidic proton like from a carboxylic acid. Oh, but wait, carboxylic acids are typically broad, but this is a singlet. Hmm, maybe not a carboxylic acid then.

Wait, another possibility: if it's an aldehyde, the H would be around 9-10 ppm. But the 11.0 ppm is higher, so maybe it's something else. Maybe an aromatic aldehyde? Or perhaps an acidic proton like in a phenol, but phenols are more around 5-7 ppm. Wait, no, that's the aromatic protons. The -OH in phenol is around 5 ppm, but in this case, the peak is at 11.0.

Wait another thought: maybe it's a formate ester? Or perhaps an aldehyde with a strong deshielded proton. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid where the proton is a singlet and not broad. But usually, carboxylic acids have broad singlets because the -OH proton is exchangeable and causes a broad peak. But in this case, it's a singlet, but I'm not sure why it's sharp. Maybe it's a deuterated solvent or maybe it's not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, let's think about the other peaks. The NMR shows 8.02 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H) and 7.72 as another doublet (d, 2H). These are in the aromatic region. The doublets suggest coupling between two sets of two protons each. So maybe para-substituted benzene rings? Because if it's para, the two protons on each substituent would be equivalent and couple with each other, leading to a doublet for each.

So, perhaps a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Let me think: if the molecule has a chloro group and a carbonyl group in the para position.

Wait, let's consider the options given. The options are A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, B)4-chlorobenzoic acid, C) Phenyl chloroformate, D)2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Let me go through each option.

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its structure would be Cl in para position to the COOH group. So, the NMR would show a singlet for the COOH proton, but usually that's broad. But in this case, the peak is
