Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about a star with some specific parameters. It has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then there's this part about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They're asking by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. So the key points here are about the effective temperature and how that affects the ionization state of Ti atoms in the stellar photosphere. Since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Wait, so the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights and E's are the energies. But in this case, the ratio is observed to decrease when spots are present. So when the star is spotted, the ratio goes down. That would mean that the ratio when not spotted is higher than when spotted.

Wait, but why does the ratio change with temperature? Because T affects the exponential term. Lower temperature would make the exponential term smaller, right? Because as T goes down, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp(-x) decreases. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease when T decreases.

Wait, but wait. The energy difference between the two levels is given as corresponding to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Let me calculate the energy difference first. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. I'll need the constants h (Planck's) and c (speed of light).

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, it's the energy difference (E2 - E1) divided by k*T. So let me compute that delta E.

Wait, but first, let's think about the temperatures. The star's Teff changes from 6000 K to 5500 K. But wait, the Teff is the overall photospheric temperature when spots are present. Does that mean that the unspotted areas are hotter? Or does the presence of spots lower the overall Teff?

Wait, I think the spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the observed Teff drops. So the unspotted regions must be hotter than the surrounding photosphere when spots are present. But wait, the question says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, that suggests that the spots are causing the average Teff to drop. So the spots are cooler than the normal photosphere.

Wait, but the star's total flux is affected by the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So the observed Teff is a kind of average. But for the photosphere, the regions without spots are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are cooler. But wait, no, wait. That's not accurate. Because when the star is spotted, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's photosphere when spotted has a lower effective temperature. But wait, that doesn't directly tell me the temperature of the spots themselves. Because the spots might be even cooler than the surrounding. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

But the main point is that when spots are present, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. So for the Boltzmann factor, the temperature used would be the effective temperature when the star has spots, and when it doesn't.

Wait, no. Because the question is about the photosphere when the star has spots. So in the presence of spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. But wait, the effective temperature is an average over the entire surface. So the presence of cooler spots would lower the overall Teff. But the individual regions (unspotted and spotted) have their own temperatures. But wait, the question is about the photosphere when the star has spots. So does that mean the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, or that parts are at lower and others at higher?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem states that when the star is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's overall properties are changing. Therefore, when the star has spots, the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K. Thus, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower.

But wait, the spots are cooler. So the unspotted regions must be hotter to bring the average down. No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you have 40% of the surface as spots, the rest is 60% of the surface. So the flux from the star is F = F_unspotted * 0.6 + F_spotted * 0.4.

But since F is sigma * Teff^4, the total flux when the star has spots would be F_total = 0.6 * sigma * (T_unspotted)^4 + 0.4 * sigma * (T_spotted)^4.

But the observed Teff when the star has spots is 5500 K, so sigma * (5500)^4 = 0.6 sigma T_un^4 + 0.4 sigma T_sp^4.

Wait, but I don't have enough information to find T_un and T_sp. The problem doesn't give the temperature of the spots. So perhaps the assumption is that the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature. So let's model that.

Wait, the Teff when not spotted is 6000 K. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. So the unspotted regions would be at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are at a lower temperature.

So, let me calculate what the effective temperature would be if 40% of the area is at a lower T and 60% at 6000 K.

Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the flux is sigma T^4. So the total flux from the star when it's spotted is F = 0.6 * sigma*(6000)^4 + 0.4 * sigma*(T_sp)^4.

But the observed Teff is 5500 K, so sigma*(5500)^4 = F.

So sigma*(5500)^4 = 0.6 sigma*(6000)^4 + 0.4 sigma*(T_sp)^4.

The sigma cancels out.

So (5500)^4 = 0.6*(6000)^4 + 0.4*(T_sp)^4.

Let me compute the numbers.

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = 5.5^4 * 1e12. 5.5^4 is 5.5*5.5=30.25, then 30.25 * 30.25 = 915.0625. So 5.5^4 = 915.0625e12? Wait, 5.5^4 = 915.0625, so 5.5e3)^4 is (5.5)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 915.0625 * 1e12 = 9.150625e14.

Similarly, 5500^4 = (5.5e3)^4 = (5.5)^4*(1e3)^4 = 915.0625e12 = 9.150625e14.

So, (5.5e3)^4 = 9.150625e14.

0.6 * (6e3)^4 = 0.6 * 1.296e15 = 7.776e14.

So substituting:

9.150625e14 = 7.776e14 + 0.4*(T_sp)^4.

So subtract 7.776e14 from both sides:

9.150625e14 - 7.776e14 = 0.4*(T_sp)^4.

Which is 1.374625e14 = 0.4*(T_sp)^4.

So T_sp^4 = (1.374625e14) / 0.4 = 3.4365625e14.

So T_sp = (3.4365625e14)^(1/4).

Calculate 3.4365625e14^(1/4).

I can compute the fourth root. Let's see, 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4, since (1e3.5)^4 = 1e14. 1e3.5 is about 3162.3.

Wait, 3.43656e14 is 3.43656 * 1e14. So 1e14 is (1e3.5)^4 ≈ 3162.3^4. So 3.43656e14 is 3.43656 times that.

The fourth root of 3.43656 is approximately 1.36, because 1.3^4 is about 2.856, 1.4^4 is ~3.8416. So 3.43656 is between 1.36 and 1.37.

Let me compute 1.36^4: 1.36 * 1.36 = 1.8496; *1.36 again: 1.8496 * 1.36 ≈ 2.515; *1.36: 2.515 * 1.36 ≈ 3.41. So 1.36^4 ≈ 3.41, which is close to 3.43656. So T_sp is approximately 1.36 * 1e3.5.

1e3.5 is 3162.3. So 1.36 *3162.3 ≈ 4308 K.

Wait, that's strange. So the spots are at about 4308 K? That's a very cool spot, but let's just go with it.

But wait, the problem says that the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K when the star is spotted. So the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, the spotted regions at 4308 K. 

But wait, the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere when the star has spots. So the photosphere is at 5500 K. Wait, but the unspotted regions are hotter, 6000 K. So the photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures.

Wait, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. So maybe each region (unspotted and spotted) is in LTE, but the observed overall spectrum is a combination of the two. But when the question talks about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere, it's a bit ambiguous whether it's referring to the entire photosphere (i.e., the average) or each individual region.

Wait, the problem says: "In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases.

But the ratio is a function of temperature. Because the Boltzmann equation depends on T. So for each region (hotter and cooler), the ratio would be different.

But wait, the observed ratio is an average because the star has both hotter and cooler regions. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the average ratio is lower when the spots are present.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the overall photosphere as being at 5500 K, and the unspotted regions are not considered because the question is about the photosphere as a whole. Hmm, but that might not make sense, since the spots are part of the photosphere.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the presence of spots cools the entire photosphere. No, that's not right. The effective temperature is the average, but the actual photosphere has regions at different temperatures.

But the question is about the photosphere when the star has spots. So perhaps the photosphere is at 5500 K. Hmm, but that can't be, because the spots are cooler. So the photosphere isn't at a uniform temperature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplified. Maybe when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. So the average T is 5500 K. But how does that affect the ratio of Ti atoms?

Wait, but the ratio n2/n1 is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each region, the ratio is calculated based on its local temperature. But when spots are present, the average ratio would be a combination of the ratios from the unspotted and spotted regions.

But the question says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the average ratio is lower. Alternatively, the problem might be considering that the temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present, so the ratio drops.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K when the star has spots. So the T used in the Boltzmann equation is 5500 K, whereas when the star doesn't have spots, T is 6000 K.

Wait, that would make sense. So when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler, so the ratio n2/n1 (which depends exponentially on 1/T) would decrease.

So the ratio when no spots is R1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-E/(k*T1)), where T1 is 6000 K.

The ratio when spots are present is R2 = (g2/g1) * exp(-E/(k*T2)), where T2 is 5500 K.

We need to find R1/R2 = [exp(-E/(k*6000))] / [exp(-E/(k*5500)))].

Which simplifies to exp( E/(k) [1/(5500) - 1/(6000)] )

Let me compute that exponent.

First, find 1/5500 - 1/6000.

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667

Difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

So exponent is E/(k) * (0.000015151).

But E is the energy difference between the two levels, which corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å.

E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10)

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon.

Hmm, but Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So E/(k) = (1.373e-18) / (1.38e-23) ≈ 9.95e4 = approx 99,500 K.

So the exponent is E/(k) * (0.000015151) ≈ 99,500 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.507.

So exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507 ≈ 4.5.

Wait, because e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.48, so approximately 4.5.

So R1/R2 ≈ 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5, so the ratio increases by a factor of ~4.5 when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

E = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

E/k = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 99500 K.

So E/k ≈ 99500.

Then, (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000-5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(33e6) )= 5e2 /3.3e7 = (5/33) * 1e-5 ≈ 0.1515 * 1e-5 = 1.515e-6.

Wait, wait, earlier I said the difference was 0.000015151, which is 1.515e-5? Wait, no:

Wait, 1/5500 is approx 0.000181818 (~1.818e-4).

1/6000 is approx 0.000166667 (~1.667e-4).

So 1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4 = 0.151e-4 = 1.51e-5.

Wait, so the difference is 1.51e-5.

So 99500 * 1.51e-5 = 99500 * 1.51e-5.

Compute: 99500 = approx 1e5, so 1e5 * 1.51e-5 = 1.51.

So E/(k) * (delta) = about 1.51.

So exponent is 1.51.

e^1.51 ≈ e^(1.5) is about 4.48, and since 1.51 is a little more, say ~4.54.

So R1/R2 is about 4.54, which is approximately 4.5. So option C is ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze how the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The ratio changes due to the temperature dependence of the exponential term.

### Step 1: Energy Difference Between Levels
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) (Planck's constant), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) (speed of light), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Dependence
The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels changes by a factor of:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (temperature without spots) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (temperature with spots). Substituting \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

Next, compute the temperature difference term:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = 1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4} = 1.51 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (99500)(1.51 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.51.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.51) \approx 4.5.
\]

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is approximately **4.5**.
