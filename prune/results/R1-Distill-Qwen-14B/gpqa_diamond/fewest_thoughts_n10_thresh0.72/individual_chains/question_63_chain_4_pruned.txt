Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can vibrate and rotate, and their energy levels are quantized. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed. I need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate and see which one matches.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think that means the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. But when the question talks about the next state with the lowest possible energy, I'm a bit puzzled. Oh, wait, in the quantum models, each state is a combination of vibrational and rotational energy levels. So the fundamental state is probably the ground state of vibration, and the lowest rotational state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase its vibrational energy level or its rotational. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so maybe it's the next higher state overall, which might involve the next vibrational level or the next rotational level.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the next state in just one mode. Wait, but the non-rigid rotor model is a bit more complex than the rigid rotor because it allows for bond length changes, so maybe it's considering both rotation and vibration. But I'm getting a bit stuck on that.

Let me think. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I believe means it's in the ground vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state, which is the ground rotational state (J=0 or J=1 depending on the model). Wait, no, for a diatomic, the rotational states start at J=0,1,2,... The ground state is J=0, I think.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition to a higher energy state. Since the problem is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, perhaps the molecule is moving to the next state in either vibration or rotation. But in the non-rigid rotor model, both rotational and vibrational energies contribute. So maybe the next state would involve the first excited vibrational state, because that would require more energy than moving up one rotational level.

Wait, but for a diatomic, the vibrational energy levels are quantized and much higher
