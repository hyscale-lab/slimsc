Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations, especially when multiple acids and bases are involved. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to find the net amount of H+ or OH- ions. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid and HCl is a strong acid, while Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, I think I should consider each component's contribution to H+ and OH-.

Wait, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base first. Because the solution volumes are different, moles will determine the strength of the acid or base in the mixture.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each solution.

For CH3COOH: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L, 0.2 M. So moles are 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles? Wait, wait. Let me recheck. The molarity is 0.3 M, so moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 OH- ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, when you mix all these, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, providing H+ ions. CH3COOH is weak, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but for initial calculation, perhaps I can treat it as a source of H+ in the same way as strong acids?

Wait, no, perhaps not. Because when you mix all the solutions, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will neutralize the OH- from the Ba(OH)2. Then, if there are excess H+ or OH- ions left, the pH will depend on that.

Wait, but I think I should first calculate the total H+ and OH- from all solutions before neutralization.

Let's see: H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is strong, so all H+ comes from that. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate, but for the initial neutralization, maybe we can consider its contribution as negligible? Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles. Alternatively, perhaps the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with both H+ from HCl and any available H+ from CH3COOH. But since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate all its H+ ions. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will donate all OH-.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and total OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then see if there's an excess of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but wait a minute. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate, but in a solution, it contributes some H+ ions. However, since we're mixing it with a strong base, perhaps the OH- from the base will react with both the H+ from HCl and any H+ from CH3COOH. But I'm not entirely sure how to handle the weak acid in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the net moles of H+ and OH- after mixing.

Wait, let's try this step by step.

First, calculate each solution's contribution to H+ and OH-.

HCl: 0.08 moles H+ (since HCl → H+ + Cl^-)

CH3COOH: it's a weak acid, so it won't release all its H+ initially. But when you mix it with a strong base, perhaps the OH- will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but I think for the purpose of neutralization, maybe all H+ (from strong acids and weak acids) will react with OH-.

But wait, perhaps the OH- will first react with the H+ from the stronger acids. Hmm, but this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- in the mixture and see which is in excess.

Wait, the total H+ would be from HCl and CH3COOH, and the total OH- is from Ba(OH)2.

So, let's compute the moles.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

H+ from CH3COOH: Let's see. Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, the amount of H+ it can donate is less than the moles present. But in the presence of a strong base (Ba(OH)2), which is a strong source of OH-, the OH- will deprotonate the CH3COOH. So perhaps all the OH- will react with H+ from HCl first, and any remaining will react with CH3COOH.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as a neutralization reaction. Let's see:

HCl provides H+ (0.08 moles).

Ba(OH)2 provides OH- (0.18 moles).

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the H+ from HCl is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

When they react, 0.08 moles of H+ will neutralize 0.08 moles of OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. Normally, it doesn't fully dissociate. So, in pure water, CH3COOH would release some H+ which can be calculated using the dissociation equation: CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

But in this case, after the strong acid HCl has reacted with some OH-, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid and may not donate much H+ on its own. However, when OH- is present, it can deprotonate the CH3COOH, extracting H+.

Wait, so perhaps the OH- will react with CH3COOH, converting it into acetate ions and water.

The reaction would be OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, each mole of OH- that reacts with CH3COOH would consume one mole of CH3COOH and produce one mole of OH- neutralized.

Wait, but wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the OH- is a strong base. So the OH- will deprotonate the CH3COOH completely. Because OH- is a strong base, it will take H+ from the weak acid.

So, the OH- leftover after neutralizing HCl is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles.

Now, the OH- (0.10 moles) will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles.

So, OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05) in a 1:1 ratio.

So, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will be deprotonated, and 0.05 moles of OH- will be consumed, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH-.

So now, after all these reactions, we have 0.05 moles of OH- remaining in the solution.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the initial OH- was 0.18, then after reacting with HCl (0.08 H+), it's 0.10 left. Then, this 0.10 reacts with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, so OH- left is 0.05.

Now, the total volume is the sum of the three solutions: 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L = approximately 0.04167 M.

Then, to find pH, since OH- concentration is known, we can find pOH first, then pH.

pOH = -log( [OH-] )

So, [OH-] is about 0.04167 M.

Calculating log(0.04167):

Log(0.04) is about 1.39794 (since 10^-1.39794 ≈ 0.04). Let me think: 0.04167 is 1/24 approximately. 24 is 2.4e1, so log(24)=1.3802. So, log(1/24)= -1.3802.

So, [OH-] is 1/24 ≈ 0.0416667, so log is -1.3802.

Wait, but wait, the exact calculation: 0.0416667 is approximately 4.16667e-2.

pOH = -log(4.16667e-2) = ?

Well, log(4.16667e-2) is log(4.16667) + log(1e-2) → log(4.16667) ≈ 0.6198, so log(4.16667e-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So, pOH = 1.3802.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

So, the pH is approximately 12.62, which matches option A.

But wait a minute, is there something I'm missing here? Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, the initial OH- moles were 0.18. Then HCl's H+ (0.08) neutralizes 0.08 of OH-, leaving 0.10.

Then, the remaining 0.10 OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which has 0.05 moles.

So, 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react with 0.05 moles of OH-, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the net OH- is 0.05, correct.

Wait, but wait, when the OH- reacts with CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, does it completely deprotonate it? Because OH- is a strong base, yes, it will deprotonate all the available CH3COOH until either OH- is consumed or CH3COOH runs out.

In this case, since OH- is 0.10 and CH3COOH is 0.05, all CH3COOH will be deprotonated, and 0.05 moles of OH- will be consumed, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So, yes, the net OH- is 0.05 moles.

Thus, after all reactions, the solution has excess OH- of 0.05 moles.

The total volume is 1.2 L, so [OH-] is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

Wait, but then the pOH is about 1.38, so pH is 12.62. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 12.62, which seems right.

But wait, let me think again. Could I have made a mistake in the neutralization steps?

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- contributions first, considering all sources, and then see if there's an excess of H+ or OH-.

Wait, let's approach it another way.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl is 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't contribute much H+. However, in the presence of excess OH-, it may deprotonate. So the H+ from CH3COOH may not be significant compared to the H+ from HCl.

Wait, but when OH- is present, the H+ from CH3COOH would react with it. So perhaps the OH- will neutralize H+ from HCl first, and then any remaining OH- will neutralize H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the previous calculation, I considered that the OH- neutralizes HCl’s H+ first, then the remaining OH- neutralizes CH3COOH’s H+. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so perhaps it can only donate some H+.

Wait, but since OH- is a strong base, it will take H+ from any source. So, in solution, the OH- will react with all available H+ from HCl and CH3COOH until it's used up or the H+ is gone.

Wait, but in this scenario, HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate all 0.08 H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.18 OH-.

So, 0.08 H+ from HCl will neutralize 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 OH-.

Then, the 0.10 OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH. How much H+ does CH3COOH contribute? Well, as a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate, but in the presence of OH- (a strong base), it will donate as much H+ as possible. So, the OH- will take H+ from CH3COOH until either the OH- is gone or the CH3COOH is all deprotonated.

CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. So, the OH- can take 0.05 moles of H+ from CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles of OH- remaining.

So, net OH- is 0.05 moles, as previously calculated.

Hmm, same result. So, the pH is 12.62, which is option A.

Wait, but another thought: when you mix the solutions, the total volume is 1200 mL, so 1.2 L. So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M. Then, pOH is about 1.38, pH is 12.62. So, option A seems correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you mix multiple acids and bases, the weak acid's contribution can complicate things. But in this case, since the OH- is in excess, any H+ from the weak acid is negligible compared to the strong base's OH-.

Wait, but wait another thing: When OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it converts it into CH3COO^- and H2O. So the moles of CH3COOH after reaction would be zero (since 0.05 moles reacted with 0.05 moles of OH-). So, the remaining OH- is 0.05 moles, which gives the pH as calculated.

So, I think my initial approach is correct. The pH is 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given acids and bases:

1. **Calculate moles of each species:**
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl fully dissociates, it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - **Reaction between H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂):**  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \) reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).
   - **Reaction between remaining OH⁻ and H⁺ (from CH₃COOH):**  
     CH₃COOH is a weak acid, but OH⁻, being a strong base, will deprotonate CH₃COOH completely.  
     \( 0.10 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \) reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of CH₃COOH} \), leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

3. **Determine the concentration of OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
     Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
     \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**, which corresponds to **option A**.
