Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is something we've covered. 

The problem states: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, each has twice the elementary charge. The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is that one charge is at the center, and the other twelve are arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters each. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Minimum energy... I think that refers to the potential energy. Because in such systems, the potential energy is minimized when the configuration is the most stable, which usually is when the charges are as close as possible. But wait, in this case, they're constrained to stay at 2 meters. So they can't move closer. So the potential energy is fixed in this configuration.

Wait, but why would it be the minimum? Oh, because if the charges were allowed to move, they would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy, but since they're constrained, this is the setup we're given. So the potential energy here is fixed, not the minimum in the sense of the lowest possible, but the energy under the given constraints. Or maybe the question is considering the potential energy in this configuration as the minimum. Hmm, not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.

So the system's potential energy is due to all the pairs of charges. I need to calculate the total potential energy U.

Each charge is 2e, so the charge of each is 2 times the elementary charge. e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 q2) / r. Since all the charges are identical, the potential energy will be the sum of all pairwise interactions.

But wait, how many pairs are there? Let me think. There are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P. The
