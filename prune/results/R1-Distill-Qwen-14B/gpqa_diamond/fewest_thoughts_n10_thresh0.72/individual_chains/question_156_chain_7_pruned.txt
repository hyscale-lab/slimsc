Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and chromatography stuff.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

First, I should recall what mCPBA does. Oh right, mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is a reaction where an alkene reacts with a peracid (like mCPBA) to form an epoxide. So, in both Reaction 1 and 2, the starting alkenes will form epoxides.

Now, about the stereochemistry of the starting alkenes. (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on opposite sides, while (Z) has them on the same side. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, so the geometry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's structure.

Wait, but how does the reaction proceed? Oh, right, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a concerted process, leading to the formation of an epoxide with specific stereochemistry. For an (E) alkene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite, so the epoxidation would probably form a trans-epoxide. Similarly, a (Z) alkene would form a cis-epoxide. Or wait, no, I think I might have that backward. Let me think again.

The mechanism of epoxidation involves the peracid attacking the double bond to form an intermediate, which then loses a proton to form the epoxide. The peracid adds in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face as the peracid's oxygen, leading to the stereochemistry of the epoxide. So, for a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide would form with the two new oxygens on the same face—so the epoxide would have a trans configuration? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to visualize it.

Alternatively, I remember that mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry of the double bond dictates the configuration of the epoxide. For an E double bond, the substituents are opposite, leading to a trans-epoxide. For a Z double bond, the substituents are adjacent, leading to a cis-epoxide. Or wait, maybe that's not right. Because when mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms come from the same side, so the resulting epoxide would have the same stereochemistry as the starting double bond.

Wait no, the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen adds to each carbon from the same face. So, for an E-alkene, the substituents on either side are opposite, so the epoxide's substituents (like the two adjacent carbons) would have the oxygens on the same face. Wait
