Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants tells us about renormalizability. If the dimension is positive, the theory might be non-renormalizable. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The idea is that renormalizable theories have couplings with mass dimension less than or equal to 4 in four spacetime dimensions. Because interactions are terms in the Lagrangian, which has dimension 4 (since the action is dimensionless, and the integral over four dimensions gives [L] = 4).

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Therefore, each term in L should be dimension 4.

So the term here is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break this down into the components.

First, I need to figure out the mass dimensions of each part. Let's recall the dimensions of the fields and coupling constants.

In four dimensions, the fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac Lagrangian is something like L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, and ∂_μ has dimension 1. So each ψ is dimension 3/2, because [i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ] must be dimension 4. Let's see: [ψ̄] is same as [ψ], so each ψ is 3/2. The derivative (dimension 1), so the term is (3/2) + 1 + (3/2) = 4. So yeah, each ψ has dimension 3/2.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Because F is made from the photon field A, which has dimension 1. F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each derivative adds dimension 1. So A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 2. Because each derivative adds 1, and each A adds 1. So F^{μν} has mass dimension 2.

Now about σ_{μν}. The definition is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Gamma matrices are dimensionless, because they're just matrices. The commutator of two γ matrices is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has the same dimensions as the gamma matrices, which are zero. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

So putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F^{μν}.

So the dimensions would be [κ] plus [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F].

Wait, but [σ] is zero, so it's [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F}.

Wait, no, actually, the term is a product of these fields. So each field's dimension adds up. So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F] = [Lagrangian term], which must be 4.

Wait, no. Wait, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, then F. So all these are fields or coupling constants, but the term must have dimension 4.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has
