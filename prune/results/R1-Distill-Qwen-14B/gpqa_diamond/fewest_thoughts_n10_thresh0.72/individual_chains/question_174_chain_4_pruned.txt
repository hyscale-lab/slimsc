Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem is about atomic nucleus fission. So, an atomic nucleus at rest (so its initial momentum is zero) undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. No other products, just these two. The nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Hmm, that's a huge amount of energy. 

The question gives some specific conditions. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. Also, the sum of the rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. Oh wait, the initial mass is M, and the sum is 0.99 M. That means some mass has been converted into kinetic energy or other forms, but since the problem says to ignore electrons, I think we're focusing on the rest mass of the two fragments.

The problem asks about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. It wants the difference between the correct relativistic value and the non-relativistic (classical) approximation. So I need to calculate T1 relativistically and then T1 classically, and find their difference.

Let me outline what I know:

1. Initial nucleus: mass M, rest energy 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV/c², but since c=1 in these units, maybe M = 300 GeV.

2. Fission produces two fragments. Let's call them fragment A (more massive) and fragment B. So mass of A is 2 times mass of B. So, m_A = 2 m_B.

3. Sum of rest masses: m_A + m_B = 0.99 M. So 2 m_B + m_B = 3 m_B = 0.99 M → m_B = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So m_A is 0.66 M.

Wait, 0.33 M + 0.66 M is 0.99 M. That makes sense.

Now, since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let's denote the velocities as v_A and v_B for fragments A and B.

But wait, since momentum is m v, but relativistically, it's gamma m v. Hmm, but maybe I can approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

In the center-of-momentum frame, after fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions with velocities such that their momenta cancel each other.

Let me think about the relativistic approach.

The total energy before fission is just the rest energy of the nucleus: E_initial = M c². Since it's at rest, kinetic energy is zero.

After fission, the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus their kinetic energies. But wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of
