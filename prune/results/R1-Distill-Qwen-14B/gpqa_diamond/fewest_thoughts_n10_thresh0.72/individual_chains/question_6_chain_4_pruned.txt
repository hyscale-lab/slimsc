Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is. 

The problem states that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions in a potential V(r, θ) given by (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. They're asking for the energy spectrum, which I think means the possible energy levels the particle can have.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in two dimensions, we can sometimes separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. The potential here depends on r and θ, so maybe I can write the potential in a way that separates these variables.

Looking at the potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out the r². So that becomes r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Wait, that simplifies to V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) (1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, another approach: think about the potential as a combination of a harmonic oscillator potential and another term. Because harmonic oscillators have potentials like (1/2) m ω² r², which in this case is similar to (1/2)k r². But here we have an extra term involving cos²θ.

Wait, maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of angular components. Let's think—cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Because I remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. (3/2)k r² times (1/2) is (3/4)k r², and (3/2)k r² times (cos 2θ)/2 is (3/4) k r² cos 2θ. So the potential is:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² +
