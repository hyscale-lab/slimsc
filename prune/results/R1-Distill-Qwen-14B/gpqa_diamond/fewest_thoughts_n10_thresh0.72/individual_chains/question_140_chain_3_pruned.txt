Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Another clue is that when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known for having a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Let me break this down.

First, the reaction setup. X reacts with Y violently, releasing gas W. W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Well, protons and neutrons are the same in number for a particular isotope, but the molecule itself—so maybe W is something like CO2? No, wait. Let me think. For a molecule, if each atom has equal protons and neutrons, but perhaps it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. Or maybe it's a molecule where the total protons equal the total neutrons.

Wait, the problem says the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the sum of protons across all atoms equals the sum of neutrons. For example, H2O: each H has 1 proton (and 0 neutrons), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 2 H + 8 O = 10. Neutrons: 8 from O, 0 from H: 8. So 10 vs 8, not equal. So not H2O.

What about CO2? Each C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (assuming it's ^12C). Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO2 has 6+8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 (from C) + 8*2 (O) = 22. Oh! So in CO2, protons and neutrons in the molecule each sum to 22. So that fits.

So if W is CO2, then gas W is carbon dioxide. So maybe X is reacting with Y to produce CO2.

Wait, but other possibilities? Let's think. Another possibility is H2, but H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which doesn't match. Or O2? Each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons. O2 would be 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So yes, that's another possibility. So W could be O2, but then the reaction would produce O2 gas.

Alternatively, another possibility is CH4. Let's check: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, H has 1 each. So CH4 has 6 + 4*(1) = 10 protons, and 6 + 4*0 (since H is 1^1) = 6 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, maybe it's a monoatomic gas. Like He? He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (for ^4He). So that's equal. So He could be W. But then, the reaction would produce He gas. Hmm, but that's less common in such reactions.

Alternatively, maybe Ne, which has 10 protons and 10 neutrons in ^20Ne. So that would also fit. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the reaction between X and Y is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid and a carbonate reacting. Like if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. But that's just a thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a metal with an acid. For example, metals reacting with acids to produce hydrogen gas. But then, H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO (carbon monoxide). Let's check: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So CO has 6+8=14 protons, and 6+8=14 neutrons. So that fits. So W could be CO.

But then, what reaction would produce CO? Maybe the decomposition of something.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is between X and Y, which is maybe a base and an acid. Let me think about the precipitate G. When the precipitate is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. What's 277 K in Celsius? 277 - 273.15 is about 3.85°C. So melting point around 0-4°C maybe? Or wait, 277
