Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about three exoplanets discovered via the TTV method. They have circular orbits. The given data includes the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and their albedos. The albedos are all 0.3, same as Earth's. We need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4? Or wait, wait. Wait the question says the ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So that would be T1/T2 = 1.4? Wait no, that can't be right because Planet1 is compared to Planet2. So maybe it's T2/T1 = 1.4? Let me read again. Oh no, the first part says the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So I think that means T1/T2 is 1.4. But wait, equilibrium temperature... T_eq usually depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I remember is T_eq = [(L (1 - a))/(16 π σ d²)]^(1/4), where L is star's luminosity, a is albedo, d is distance.

Wait but in this problem, all planets have the same albedo, 0.3. So the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would depend on the square root of the inverse of their orbital distances because T_eq is proportional to (L (1-a))^(1/4) / d^(1/2). So T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). 

Wait no, let's think again. T_eq is proportional to (L/(d^2))^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4). But since 1 - a is the same for all planets, the ratio of temperatures would be (L is same for all, same star), so T_eq is proportional to 1/(d)^(1/2). So T_eq ~ 1/sqrt(d).

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1) because T ~ 1/sqrt(d). So if T1/T
