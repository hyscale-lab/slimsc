Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. They give some stability constants and ask about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex.

Alright, let me break down the information. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given for the complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex, which would be the second one, so maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) is the one with two SCN- ligands.

Wait, but I should clarify the complexes. Cobalt can form various complexes with thiocyanate. The stability constants β represent the formation of Co(SCN)_n^(2−n) complexes. So β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^(+), β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^(0), β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^(−), and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2−? Or wait, wait, no. Wait, the charge on the complex would be 2+ minus the charge from the SCN- ions. Each SCN- is -1, so for n SCN, the charge would be 2+ - n*1−. Hmm, maybe.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. Cobalt(II) is Co^2+. If it binds with n SCN^- ions, each SCN is -1, so the complex would have a charge of 2+ - n*(1−). So for n=1, it's Co(SCN)^(2+ -1) = Co(SCN)^+, which would be the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+. The β1 is 9 for that.

Similarly, for n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, since 2+ -2*(−1) = 0. β2 is 40.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^−, because 2+ -3(-1) = 2+ +3 -3 = 2+? Wait, wait no. Wait, each SCN is -1. So for n=3, the complex charge would be 2+ + (3*(-1))? No, wait, wait, wait. No, the formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2+ - n*(−1)), because each SCN contributes -1.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the charge of the complex ion is the charge of the metal plus the sum of the charges of the ligands. So Co^2+ plus n SCN^- (each -1) gives charge: 2+ + (n*(-1)) = 2+ - n.

So for n=1: 2+ -1 = +1 → [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9.

n=2: 2+−2=0 → [Co(SCN)_2] → β2=40.

n=3: 2+−3= -1 → [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63.

n=4: 2+−4= -2 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2− → β4=16.

But the problem is asking about the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- per Co^2+? So that would be the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, which is neutral. But wait, I think the blue one is the tetrahedral complex with two SCN- ligands? Or maybe the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) is blue. Wait, perhaps I should think about the colors of the different complexes. I remember that [Co(SCN)_4]^3− is usually blue. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Alternatively, the [Co(SCN)_3]^- might be blue. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the problem without relying on that. The question states it's the blue dithiocyanato, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+). Wait, no, dithiocyanato means two SCN- groups, so maybe that's [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+). But wait, the charge would be 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0.

Wait, maybe I should not get stuck on the color but focus on the question. The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all Co species. So dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (neutral), which has a stability constant β2=40.

Now, the task is to calculate the distribution of all possible cobalt species and find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

The approach to find the fraction is to use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligands (SCN^-) and the metal (Co^2+). The general approach is to consider all possible species of Co and calculate their concentrations, then find which one is the desired species.

But considering all species might be a bit complicated, but perhaps we can model the problem using the formation of each complex step by step and find the dominant species.

The idea is to use the stability constants (logβ) to calculate the fraction of each complex. Since the problem is about multiple complexes, I need to consider all possible complexes and find their concentrations.

Wait, but the problem gives us a bunch of βs, but perhaps we can model this with the formation of the complexes step by step.

The initial species are Co^2+ and SCN^-.

The reaction steps are:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+ ; β1=9.

2. [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 ; β2=40.

3. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^− ; β3=63.

4. [Co(SCN)_3]^− + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^2− ; β4=16.

Wait, but β4 is 16. Or perhaps it's for the next step. Hmm.

Wait,
