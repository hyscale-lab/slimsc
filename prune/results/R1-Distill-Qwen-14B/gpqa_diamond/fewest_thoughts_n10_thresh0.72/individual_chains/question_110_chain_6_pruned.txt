Okay, so I've got this question about stars that can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are visible to both. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question gives some info about the apparent magnitudes each spectrograph can handle. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17 mag, which means it can see stars with V mag ≤17. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, so it can handle stars up to V mag ≤16. So any star that's brighter than 17 (so V mag ≤17) can be seen by ESPRESSO, and any brighter than 16 (V mag ≤16) can be seen by HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, its V magnitude must be ≤16 because both can see up to that, but ESPRESSO can go a bit fainter. Wait, no, for both to detect, the star must be within both's limits. So the star must have V mag ≤16 because HIRES can't see beyond that. Because if it's brighter than 16 (like 15), both can see it. If it's 17 mag, ESPRESSO can, but HIRES can't.

Now, let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is M. To find the apparent magnitude, I can use the distance modulus: V = M + 5 log10(d/10). So d is 10 pc, so log10(1) is 0. So V =15.5 + 0 =15.5 mag. So apparent is 15.5. Both ESPRESSO (which can go to 17) and HIRES (which can go to 16) can see this. So Star1 is a candidate for both.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude 16.5. So wait, that's already given. Since HIRES can only go up to 16, Star2
