Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that spin states are usually represented as vectors in a two-dimensional space because electrons are spin-½ particles. The state (3i,4) must be a two-component spinor. So, the electron's spin state is given as a column vector [3i, 4]^T, right? Or wait, maybe it's written as (3i,4), so the first component is 3i and the second is 4. So the state vector χ is:

χ = [3i, 4]^T.

Now, the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. But wait, what's S_y in terms of Pauli matrices? Oh right! The spin operator S for a particle with spin-½ is given by S = (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y.

Let me write down σ_y as given in the note. The matrix is:

σ_y = [ [0, -i],
         [i, 0] ]

So, S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, the spin state is χ = [3i, 4]^T. But wait, I should check if this state is normalized. The norm is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) = 25. So the norm is √25 = 5. Oh, but for expectation values, maybe I don't need to normalize the state first? Or do I? Hmm, I think the expectation value still works without normalization because the formula includes the inner product, which would account for that.

Wait, no. The expectation value is ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩
