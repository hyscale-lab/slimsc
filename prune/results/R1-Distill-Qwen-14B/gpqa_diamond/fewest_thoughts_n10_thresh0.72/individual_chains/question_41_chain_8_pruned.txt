Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer as well, same direction as the light beam. So both the glass and the light are moving towards the observer. But the light is inside the glass, which has a refractive index n.

I remember that in different media, light slows down. The speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, without any movement, the speed of light in the glass would be 1/n (since c=1 here). But now the glass is moving, so I need to account for that.

Wait, but how does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light in it? Oh right, this is probably a scenario involving the addition of velocities, maybe using special relativity? Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add linearly; we have to use the Lorentz transformation or
