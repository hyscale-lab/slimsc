Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So, the substituent is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. That probably means the oxygen is connected to the bridgehead carbon of the norbornane system. So the structure has a bridged bicyclic system with a tert-butoxy substituent.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and with dibromides, I'm thinking elimination might occur, but wait, in the presence of a base, maybe substitution. Or wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution reaction. So the compound has two dibromomethyl groups on positions 5 and 6 of a cyclohexadiene. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has BrCH2 groups at 5 and 6.

When it's treated with sodium iodide, I think the bromides might undergo a substitution. But wait, sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So perhaps each of the dibromomethyl groups will lose a Br and gain an iodide. But wait, waitâ€”each of the dibromomethyl groups has two Br atoms. So each BrCH2Br would react with two equivalents of NaI, swapping both Brs for I? But the question says 2 equivalents of the dibromocyclohexadiene. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Oh, wait, no, the dibromocyclohexadiene is the starting material, and it's reacting with NaI. So perhaps each of those dibromomethyl groups will have one Br replaced by I. Or maybe both Brs are replaced? Wait, each dibromomethyl group is BrCH2Br. So each has two bromide leaving groups. So with two equivalents of NaI, perhaps each Br is
