Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it carefully and think through each part.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Hmm, wait, the same alpha-proton shouldn't have two peaks, right? But the chemical shifts are similar, integrals add up to 1H, so maybe it's not a splitting due to coupling. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so that's not the case. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then looking at the LC-MS: the crude compound shows two peaks with the same mass. Since they have the same mass and intensity, but different peaks, perhaps they are isomers or something else but same molecular weight. But since it's a mixture, maybe they're diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, the options are A) precursor, B) enantiomers, C) double coupling in amide bond, D) diastereomers.

Let me think about each option. Option A is about a precursor. If the compound isn't fully formed, maybe the starting material is still present. But the NMR shows the expected molecule, so if there was a precursor, the NMR would have extra peaks, perhaps. Also, the question says the NMR is consistent except for the two peaks. So maybe the main product has something wrong, but the LC-MS shows two peaks.

Option B: mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have identical physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. So in the NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the alpha-proton might split into multiple peaks due to coupling, but wait, the coupling pattern rules out that. Because in enantiomers, each enantiomer's protons would be identical in their own structure. Wait, but for an alpha-proton in a peptide, if the molecule is chiral, each enantiomer would have the same environment. So the NMR would not show two separate peaks because each enantiomer has the same proton environment. Unless the sample is a racemic mixture, and maybe the instrument is not able to separate them, but I'm not sure how that affects the NMR. Alternatively, maybe if there's some impurity, but the question says the NMR
