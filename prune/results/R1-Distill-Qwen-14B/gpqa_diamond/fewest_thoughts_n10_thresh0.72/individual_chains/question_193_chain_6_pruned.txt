Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are like different powers of r: r squared, r cubed, r to the fourth, r to the fifth.

Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Parallax and distance are inversely related. Right, because parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx is approximately 1 over distance in parsecs, I think. So if you go further away, the parallax decreases.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then plx^5 would be (1/d)^5, so 1/(d^5). So 1/(plx^5) would be (d^5). So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance, per unit range. So they're asking for the change in N as a function of distance. So maybe they're looking for dN/dr, the derivative of N with respect to r. Or perhaps not the derivative, but how N scales with r, like a proportionality.

Wait, but wait. The number of stars N is given as proportional to 1/plx^5. And plx is 1/r, assuming r is in parsecs. So r = distance, plx = 1/r.

So N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5 ) = r^5. So N varies as r^5. So the number of stars increases with r^5. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance.

Wait, so if you have a region of the sky, how does
