Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm, first, I should recall what mCPBA does. Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, and it's commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific and forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry. For example, in a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide will form with a certain configuration, and for a cis (Z) alkene, another configuration. But wait, mCPBA is an oxidizing agent that forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic reaction. The stereochemistry of the epoxidation depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, no, more accurately, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are added in a specific manner. The reaction typically leads to the formation of an epoxide with a trans configuration relative to the starting alkene.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The reaction between an alkene and mCPBA is an electrocyclic opening. The peracid adds across the double bond, and the transition state involves the formation of an intermediate where the peracid's oxygen opens the double bond. For a trans (E) alkene, the addition would result in the epoxide having a certain configuration, and for a cis (Z) alkene, another.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me remember: When a peracid reacts with an alkene, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because the peracid adds to the same face, so the two new oxygen bonds are on the same face. So for a trans (
