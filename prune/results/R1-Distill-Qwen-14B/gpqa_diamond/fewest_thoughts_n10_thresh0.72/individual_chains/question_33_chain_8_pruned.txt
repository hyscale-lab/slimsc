Okay, so I have this cycloaddition reaction to figure out. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is done under heat. I'm supposed to find the exo product from the given options. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. These are between a diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring. The exo rule says that the more substituted (more bulky) groups end up on the same side in the ring, leading to the exo transition state, which is more favorable because of better orbital overlap and sometimes favorable steric effects.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I think the exo rule is about the approach of the dienophile and diene. The exo transition state has the substituents on the same face, leading to the exo product where the groups are on the same side. Oh, right, the exo product is when the substituents are on the same face, leading to a more stable transition state because of better orbital overlap.

So, the diene in this reaction would be the more conjugated one. Let's see, 2,5-dimethylthiophene has two methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with sulfur, right? So, its structure is a five-membered ring with S and alternating double bonds. The substituents are methyl at 2 and 5.

On the other hand, furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile. Furan has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. Wait, no, furan-2,5-dione is like two ketone groups on the furan ring. So, structure-wise, furan has an oxygen, and in this case, the 2 and 5 positions (which are adjacent to the oxygen) have ketone groups.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene is the conjugated diene, and the dienophile is a molecule with a double bond that can react. So, 2,5-dimethylthiophene has a conjugated diene system because of the double bonds in the ring. Wait, but wait, thiophene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, right? So, it's a diene, but is it a conjugated diene? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the dienophile is the furan-2,5-dione because it's an electron-deficient dienophile.

Wait, let me think again. The diene is typically the conjugated diene, which is the electron-rich component. The dienophile is usually an electron-deficient molecule. So, furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups; those are electron-withdrawing, making the
