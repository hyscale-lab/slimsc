Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), I think that's a two-component vector. And the options are A to D with some expressions involving hbar.

Wait, I remember the expectation value is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So for spin, the operator is the Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are the sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So sigma_y is given here as a 2x2 matrix: [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

The electron's spin state is given as a vector (3i, 4). Let me think, in quantum mechanics, the spin state is a column vector. So in this case, the state vector ψ is [3i; 4]. Or wait, sometimes it's written as row vectors, but I think for the purposes of the inner product, it's better to treat it as a column vector. So ψ is a column vector with first component 3i and second component 4.

The operator for S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y. To find the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

So let's break it down. First, write the state as a column vector ψ = [3i; 4], which is a 2x1 vector. The conjugate transpose, ⟨ψ|, is a 1x2 row vector [ -3 (since the conjugate of 3i is -3), 4 ]. Wait, wait, 3i's conjugate is -3i? No, wait. Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i, but when I take the transpose, it becomes a row vector with components [ -3i, 4 ]? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the state is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. When I take the conjugate transpose, each component's complex conjugate is taken. So (3i)* is -3i, and 4* is 4. So ⟨ψ| is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, the components are 3i and 4, so when I take the conjugate, 3i becomes -3i, and 4 remains 4. So ⟨ψ| would be [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector.

So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) * ⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩.

So first, compute sigma_y times |ψ⟩. Sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let me compute sigma_y * ψ.

Let me write out the matrix multiplication:
