Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about eigenvectors for a given operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied. The operator here is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary but in x-z. That probably means the operator is a combination of P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh right, because the operator P is a vector operator, so it's P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. But since the direction is n, the operator along n would be something like P · n. 

The question gives me the components of the operator P. Let me write them down:

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So P_x matrix is [[0, 1], [1, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So P_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So P_z matrix is [[1,0], [0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2.

The operator we're considering is P along n, which lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, wait, since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? No, wait, in spherical coordinates, any direction in x-z plane would have φ=0 (along +x) or φ=π (along -x), but more generally, perhaps θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, no, that's if it's in the x-z plane. Hmm, wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle. So in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, depending on which side. So n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if φ=0, but when φ=π, it would be (-sinθ, 0, cosθ). Alternatively, perhaps the direction is arbitrary, so we can just say n is (a, 0, b), but a^2 + b^2 =1.

But regardless, the operator P·n would be (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). Since n is in x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So P·n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Oh wait, but the problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction
