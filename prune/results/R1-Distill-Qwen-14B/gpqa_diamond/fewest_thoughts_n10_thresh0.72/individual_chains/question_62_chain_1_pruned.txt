Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me parse that name. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group attached. But wait, the substituent is more complicated. The substituent is at position 1, so that's the same position as the aldehyde. So the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group and another substituent attached.

Breaking down the substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. It's (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, meaning a methyl group that's attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is a CH2 group where one hydrogen is replaced by cyclohexyl and the other by OH. Wait, no, the substituent on the main cyclohexane is a CH2 group with a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group attached. So the structure is:

Main ring: cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) at position 1.

At position 1, attached is a CH2 group. That CH2 is connected to another cyclohexane ring and an OH group. So the substituent is a CH2-OH connected to the main ring, and a cyclohexyl group connected to the same CH2. So, the structure is:

Main cyclohexane has a CH2 group attached. That CH2 is bonded to a cyclohexyl group (as a substituent) and also to an OH group. So it's like:

Main ring → CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). Hmm, so the substituent is a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to the same CH2 group which is attached to the main ring.

Now, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. So, structure is cyclohexane-C≡
