Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving toward the observer, and the beam is going in the same direction. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it.

I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium can change as observed from another frame. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is normally c/n, right? So in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed would be c/n, since c is the vacuum speed and n is the refractive index.

But here, the glass is moving. So we have to consider how the speed transforms when the medium itself is moving. I think this is a case for relativistic velocity addition. Because if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, then the light's velocity in the lab frame would be affected by that.

Wait, but wait a minute. Relativity comes into play when dealing with speeds
