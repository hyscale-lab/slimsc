Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see... Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Or wait, actually, no, I think the formula is Z = sum exp(-β E), but sometimes it's written as sum exp(-E/(kT)), which is the same thing since β is 1/(kT). So β is 1/(kT), so E is multiplied by β.

But wait, the energy is given with a negative J, so E is negative J times the sum of the products. So when I calculate exp(-β E), it'll be exp(J β times the sum of the products).

But I'm not sure, let me think again. The partition function is summing over all possible states the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-β E). So E is the energy of the state, and it's given by that expression.

So the first step is to find all possible states of the system. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so three spins have 2^3 = 8 possible states. So I'll need to list all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3, compute E for each, then compute the Boltzmann factor, and sum them all up.

Alternatively, maybe I can find
