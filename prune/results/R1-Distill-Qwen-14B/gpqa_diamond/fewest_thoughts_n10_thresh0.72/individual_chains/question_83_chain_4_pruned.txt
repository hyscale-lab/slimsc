Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations yet. But let's try to think it through step by step.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, right. Let's break this down. First, I think I need to find out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula.

So, the initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and its concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration (C1) can be found using C1V1 = C2V2. Wait, yes, because the number of moles stays the same.

Moles of acetic acid before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters) = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the volume is 0.04 L. So new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that's 0.025 M. Got it.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction would be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added would equal the moles of acetic acid. So, let's find the equivalence point volume.

Moles of acetic acid in diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001. So, moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001.

Concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration, which is when 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So, 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, I think it's more about moles. So at 25% tit
