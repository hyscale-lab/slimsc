Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. Let me read the question again. It says Pi(+) is stationary and decays into mu(+) and nu (which I assume is a neutrino, maybe muon neutrino). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. So the products are mu plus and a neutrino.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very small (almost zero) mass. But in particle physics, sometimes we approximate their rest mass as zero. So I think in this case, the neutrino's mass is neglected compared to the muon's. So when calculating energy, I can treat the neutrino as massless.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles. Hmm, okay. So when a particle at rest decays into two particles, the energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the initial momentum is zero (Pi is stationary), the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Let me outline what I know. The process is:

Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu

Given masses: m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c², m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c², and m_nu ≈ 0 (I'll treat it as zero for simplicity).

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of Pi, which is m_pi c². But since we're using units where c=1 (as in MeV and MeV/c²), that's just m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of mu and nu. The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. So:

Total energy after = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + (E_nu)

But because the neutrino is massless, its energy is E_nu = |p_nu| c, since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². And since m_nu ≈ 0, E_nu = p_nu c. Using c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

Similarly, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)² ) / c²? Wait, no. Let me think again. In units where c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²), where p is in MeV/c and m is in MeV/c². Wait, no, units are a bit tricky. Let me make sure.

Wait, actually, in natural units (where c=1), energy E in MeV, momentum p in MeV/c, then E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4. So E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So if I set c=1 (as is common in particle physics), E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So E = sqrt(p^2 + m^2).

But wait, when we're given m_pi in MeV/c², and p in MeV/c, how does that work? Let me double-check the units. For example, for the muon, its energy is E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2 ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach this by considering energy and momentum conservation.

Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p (let's say p is the magnitude).

So, for the muon:

E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c^2 ?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the units. Let me think in terms of units where c=1, which simplifies things.

In that case, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p (since m_nu=0).

The total energy after decay must equal the initial energy, which is m_pi c^2. Again, in c=1, that's m_pi.

So: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi

Substituting:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi

We can solve for p.

Let me write the equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root.

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2

Expand the right side:

= m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2

So:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2

Simplify by subtracting p^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p

Rearranged:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2

So:

p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi)

Compute that.

Given m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

Compute numerator: (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

Let me compute (a^2 - b^2) = (a - b)(a + b).

a = 139.6, b=105.7.

a + b = 245.3, a - b = 33.9.

So (a^2 - b^2) = 33.9 * 245.3.

Compute 33.9 * 245.3:

Let me compute 33 * 245 = 33 * 200 = 6600, 33*45=1485 → total 8085.

Then, 0.9 * 245.3 = 220.77. So total 8085 +220.77 = 8305.77.

So numerator is 8305.77 (MeV)^2.

Denominator is 2 * 139.6 MeV → 279.2 MeV.

So p = 8305.77 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

8305.77 / 279.2 ≈ let's approximate.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 (since 279.2*30=8376, subtract 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8).

So 29 gives 8096.8, which is less than 8305.77.

Difference is 8305.77 - 8096.8 = 208.97.

Now, how much more is that in terms of 279.2?

208.97 / 279.2 ≈ ~0.748.

So total p ≈ 29.748 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, since in c=1 units, we're talking about p as MeV/c? Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck.

Wait, in c=1 units, p is in MeV/c (since E is in MeV, and E = pc for massless particles). So when we compute p, it's in MeV/c.

But wait
