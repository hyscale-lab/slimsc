Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and pH calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

Wait, first, I should recall what KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are. I think KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4 is sodium dihydrogen phosphate. So in solution, they should dissociate. But I'm getting a bit confused, maybe I should write down their dissociations.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water. So the main ions in solution would be K+, Na+, H2PO4^-, and HPO4^2-.

The question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. Hmm, but wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, and its conjugate bases are H2PO4^- (from first dissociation), HPO4^2- (second), and PO4^3- (third). So in this solution, are we generating any PO4^3-?

I think the phosphate species in solution at 25°C will depend on the pH. Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, this looks like a buffer system. Because buffer solutions resists pH changes, and they are made of a weak acid and its conjugate base.

Wait, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, with three dissociation steps, each with their own Ka values. The given Ka values are Ka1
