Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Hmm, let me think. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, nu is a neutrino, right? And the pion is at rest. 

The problem gives the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Oh, I remember that the neutrino's rest mass is usually considered negligible in these kinds of problems because it's very light. So, I can probably treat it as massless.

So, the question is about finding the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. I think since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the total momentum after must also be zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So, p_mu = -p_nu.

But wait, how does that help me find their kinetic energies? Let me recall some formulas. The total energy of a particle is the sum of its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. So, E = mc² + KE. But since we're dealing in units where c is incorporated into MeV, like MeV/c² masses, perhaps I need to think in terms of four-momentum.

The pion is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV. The decay products, muon and neutrino, must share this energy, but also their momenta must add up to zero.

Let me write down the conservation equations. 

Energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum conservation: p_pi = p_mu + p_nu = 0 → p_mu = -p_nu

But the neutrino's mass is negligible, so E_nu ≈ p_nu c. Oh wait, but in units where c=1, E_nu = |p_nu|.

Similarly, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, better to write it correctly. Wait, E_mu squared is (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. So E_mu = sqrt( p_mu² c² + m_mu² c^4 ) / c
