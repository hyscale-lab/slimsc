Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the setup is that we have three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're all in a system with circular orbits, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just providing context.

The problem gives me two temperature ratios. The first is the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2, which is approximately 1.4. So T1 is 1.4 times T2. Wait, or is it that T2 is 1.4 times T1? Wait, no, the way it's written: the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So, I think that means T1/T2 = 1.4. Or wait, maybe it's T2/T1? Because sometimes ratios can be ambiguous. Let me read it again. "The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." So that could mean T_Planet1 / T_Planet2 = 1.4. Or maybe the other way around. Hmm. I'll have to figure that out as I go.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So that's T2/T3 = 2.3, or T3/T2 = 2.3? Hmm.

I also have mass ratios. The mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 1.35. So M1/M2 = 1.15, and M2/M3 = 1.35. So M1 is bigger than M2, and M2 is bigger than M3.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Specifically, by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. So albedo doesn't come into play here since it's the same for all.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = [(L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²)]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star (semi-major axis, which for circular orbits is just the radius). So, if all three planets orbit the same star, L and a are the same for all, so T is proportional to 1/(D^(1/2)), because D squared is in the denominator, and the fourth root makes it 1/(D^(1/2)).

Wait, let's write that again. T is proportional to (1/D)^0.5, because T ∝ (L (1-a))^(1/4) / (D^(1/2)). So,
