Okay, so I've got this question about redshift and detecting objects with neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstrom. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, right. The Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line from hydrogen. In the rest frame, it's 1216 Angstrom, which is in the ultraviolet range. But when the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength gets stretched, so we see it at a longer wavelength.

But optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So for us to observe the absorption in the optical range, the shifted Lyman alpha must fall into the optical wavelengths. So the redshift must be enough to move 1216 Angstrom into the range that optical telescopes can detect.

What's the optical range? I think optical is roughly 400-700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstrom. Wait, because 1 nm is 10 Angstrom, right? So 400 nm is 4000 Angstrom, 700 nm is 7000 Angstrom. So the Lyman alpha line needs to shift into this range.

So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_rest * (1 + z), right? Because redshift z is (lambda_obs - lambda_rest)/lambda_rest. So solving for z: z = (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1.

We need lambda_obs >= 4000 Angstrom (since that's the start of optical). Wait, but wait! The Lyman-alpha is 1216 Angstrom rest. So when it's observed, if it's at 4000 Angstrom, the shift would be 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29. So z ≈ 2.29.

Wait, but wait. Because if the cloud is at a redshift z, then the background quasar must be at a higher redshift, right? Because the cloud is in
