Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The user is looking at some analytical data and trying to figure out what's going on. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, the 1H NMR spectrum. It's mostly consistent with the expected molecule, but there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integration suggests that it's the same proton being split into two, but why?

The question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that explanation. Spin-spin coupling usually causes splitting into multiple peaks, like a doublet or triplet. If it's the same proton, maybe it's something else causing the split. Wait, what else can cause a peak to split into two? Maybe diastereotopic protons or something related to stereochemistry.

Looking at the LC-MS analysis, it shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So, same molecular weight, but two separate entities. Because the mass is the same, it's not a fragment or a different adduct. So, the crude compound must have two different forms with the same mass.

So, what options are given? The options are A to D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The LC-MS shows same mass, so if it's a precursor, it would have a lower mass, right? Because a precursor is usually the starting material that hasn't undergone a reaction. So this might not fit because the mass should be lower, but here both peaks are same as expected.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, which are stereoisomers. They would have the same mass, same NMR shifts because they're identical in all aspects except for the spatial arrangement. Wait, but if they are enantiomers, the NMR would show the same peaks, wouldn't it? Unless the NMR is run in a chiral environment. Oh wait, but the 1H NMR is showing two peaks for the same proton. Enantiomers shouldn't cause that. Because in a regular NMR, they would look identical since the environment is the same. So maybe B isn't the answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide formation. I'm not too familiar with this term, but perhaps it refers to some kind of coupling in the reaction leading to two products. Not sure. Alternatively, it might refer to the formation of an amide where coupling leads to some splitting. But I'm not sure how that would cause the NMR peaks to split like that.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR spectra. But wait, wait. In the NMR, the alpha proton is giving two peaks. Diastereomers would have different environments, so maybe the same proton in two different environments would split into two, but why similar shifts? If the protons are in similar environments in the diastereomers, maybe they are close in shift, which explains why the peaks are similar. Also, the integral adds up to 1H because there are two diastereomers, each with
