Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying a chemical based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The unknown compound's data includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the FTIR. The broad absorption around 3000 cm-1 probably indicates O-H stretching, like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. I'm trying to remember what those peaks correspond to. The 1700 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), maybe an ester or ketone. The 1650 might be conjugated, like an aromatic ring's C=C stretching or maybe an amide? But no, since the options don't have N, probably the conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those in alkenes, so the compound must have a double bond. So the structure probably includes an alkene group.

Looking at the Mass Spec, the fragment peak at m/z=45. Common fragments at 45 are things like (CH3)2CHO+ (which is 45, but I'm not sure), or maybe a fragment involving an ester or another group. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of C3H7O or something similar. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the base peak is from a common fragment like C3H7 or something else.

Now, let me look at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

So, the molecular formulas vary in O and H counts. Let's think about possible structures for each formula.

The FTIR suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound is likely a ketone, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid derivative. But the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 is more like an O-H from an alcohol or maybe a phenol. Wait, phenols also have broad O-H stretches. But another possibility: if the compound is a car
