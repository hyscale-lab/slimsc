Okay, so I've got this question about planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me a lot of data. Let me list out what I know:

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. So, it's a bit more massive and larger than the Sun, but similar in temperature. 

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think means they reflect the same amount of light, so albedo doesn't affect the temperature ratio.

The RV method detects planets by their Doppler shift. Here, the shifts are given in forbidden lines. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 a shift of 0.04 Å in the same line at 6300 Å. Wait, but the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement because of the planet's gravity. So the shift would be related to the planet's mass and orbital period, I think.

Wait, maybe I should remember the formula for the Doppler shift in RV method. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by some formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. But wait, I'm trying to find the equilibrium temperature, which depends on the planet's distance from the star, right?

Because equilibrium temperature is calculated using the formula:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

Wait, no, the formula is a bit different. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

Teq = T_star * ( R_star / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25 * (1 / sqrt(1 + m_planet/m_star) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. The albedo is (1 - reflectivity), so the planet absorbs (1 - albedo) of the incident flux. But since both have the same albedo, that factor cancels out in the
