Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scenario is that we have an atom, and we want to observe its decay. From previous experiments, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and the question is about the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes from the start? Let me re-read the question.

Oh, right. So, the initial time is when we start monitoring. 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, wait, the wording says "the next 150 minutes". So, I think that means the remaining time after the 50 minutes. So the total time observed would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, the question could mean, after the 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes, so the total time from now is 150 minutes. But I think the way it's phrased, "the next 150 minutes", refers to the time after the current point, which is 50 minutes in.

Wait, but the initial data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that's the half-life or something? No, wait, 32% is the probability of decay in 100 minutes. Wait, that's not a half-life because the half-life is the time when half the atoms have decayed, but that's a specific formula.

Wait, radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The decay probability in a given time, t, is given by the formula P = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Alternatively, the probability of decay is sometimes expressed as the cumulative distribution function of the exponential distribution.

Wait, but wait, actually, in radioactive decay, the chance that a nucleus decays in a certain time interval is based on the exponential decay law. So the probability that it hasn't decay
