Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that we have an atom whose decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed without decay. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, wait. Wait, the next 150 minutes from when? Because 50 minutes have passed already, so are we talking about the next 150 minutes after the initial 100, making it a total of 250, or is it 150 minutes from now, which is 200 total?

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes." So I think it's 150 minutes starting from the current time, so 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total. Oh wait, but the initial decay probability is given as 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? And the key thing is that it's memoryless. So the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the probability it decays in any given interval is the same regardless of when you start.

So the given data is that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%. So I can model this using the decay formula. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life, but I think it's easier to model using the exponential decay law.

The formula for the probability of decay (N(t)) is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λ t). But wait, actually, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed after time t is e^(-λ t). So the probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-λ t).

Wait, but the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that would mean:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

From this equation, I can solve for λ. Let's rearrange:
