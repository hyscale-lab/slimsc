Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and it's creating intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can approximate tan(theta) with theta.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern formed is a diffraction pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles. The formula I remember for the minima in a single-slit diffraction is a sin(theta) = mλ, where m is an integer (like 1, 2, 3...), and a is the slit width. But wait, in this problem, the aperture isn't a single slit; it's an N-sided polygon. When N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? So maybe the problem is similar to a circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

Wait, no, wait. If it's a polygon, when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle, but the apothems are all the same. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, as N increases, the apothem 'a' approaches the radius 'R' of the circumscribed circle. So, for a circle, the radius R would be equal to the apothem 'a' multiplied by something. Wait, no, the apothem of a regular polygon is related to the radius. The apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle. So as N approaches infinity, the regular polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' becomes the radius of that circle. So the circle has radius 'a'.

Wait, but in the single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at a sin(theta) = mλ. The first minimum (m=1) happens at theta where sin(theta) = λ/(2a). Wait, no, wait. For a single slit of width 'a', the first minimum is at a sin(theta) = λ, so sin(theta) = λ/(a). Wait, no, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is sin(theta) = mλ/a, where m is the order. So the first minimum is at m=1, so sin(theta) = λ/a. But wait, that can't be right because when a is small, the angle would be large. But in this problem, they're considering small angles, so maybe it's better to use the small angle approximation.

Wait, but when N is infinite, the aperture is a circle. So perhaps the diffraction pattern becomes a circular one. But wait, for a circular aperture, the minima are given by something else. Oh, right! For a circular aperture, the first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle given by sin(theta) = 1.22 λ/(π a) or something like that. Wait, no, I think the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum is at the first zero of the derivative of the Bessel function J1, which occurs at approximately theta where sin(theta) = 1.22 λ/(π a), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should be careful. The problem states that the shape is a polygon with N sides, and when N is infinitely large, it becomes a circle. The apothem is the same for all sides, so in the limit, the circle has a radius equal to the apothem. Wait, no, wait. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a regular polygon is also the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N becomes very large, the regular polygon becomes a circle, but the apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle. But the radius of the circumscribed circle of the polygon (which would approach the actual radius of the circle when N is large) is a * (something). Wait, for a regular polygon, the radius R (circumradius) is related to the apothem a as R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So for the circle, the radius is a.

But wait, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is different from a single slit. For a circular aperture, the central maximum is surrounded by rings. The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at an angle where the Bessel function J1 reaches its first zero. The formula is approximately θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (π a) when using the first zero of J1, which is around 3.8317 for the first zero. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is given by sin(theta) = (m * π * λ) / (a * (2 * m + 1)), but that's not quite right. Alternatively, the condition for the minima in a circular aperture is given by the zeros of the derivative of the Bessel function J1. The first zero occurs at around 3.8317, so the condition is J1'(k a sin(theta)) = 0. So, k a sin(theta) ≈ 3.8317, where k is 2π/λ. So, sin(theta) = (3.8317 λ) / (2 π a). But wait, 3.8317 divided by 2π is approximately 3.8317/(6.2832) ≈ 0.609, so sin(theta) ≈ (0.609 λ)/a. Then, since the angles are small, sin(theta) ≈ theta, so theta ≈ 0.609 λ/a. So the first minimum is at around 0.609 λ/a.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is m=1, the second is m=2. So for the circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where sin(theta) = ( (2m + 1) * λ ) / (2a) ), but wait, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing this up with the single-slit condition. Let me clarify.

Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the primary minima occur at certain angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel function. For the first minimum (the first dark ring), the condition is that the argument of the Bessel function J1 reaches its first zero. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317. So the condition is:

k a sin(theta) = 3.8317,

where k = 2π/λ. So:

sin(theta) = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a).

Calculating 3.8317/(2π) gives approximately 3.8317/(6.2832) ≈ 0.609. So sin(theta) ≈ 0.609 λ/a.

But wait, when N is large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' is the radius. So the first minimum occurs at theta ≈ 0.609 λ/a. But wait, the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at m=1, and the second at m=2. So what is the condition for the second minimum?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Oh, wait, wait. For a circular aperture, the minima are not as straightforward as in the single-slit case. The first minimum is the first dark ring, which is the first point where the intensity drops to zero beyond the central maximum. But I'm not entirely sure if the subsequent minima are spaced in a particular way.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the polygon is treated as a single slit, but that doesn't make sense. Because when N is large, it's a circle, not a slit. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a collection of slits or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe when the polygon is approached in the limit of N approaching infinity, the diffraction pattern simplifies. Let's think about the general case of a regular polygon with N sides and apothem 'a', and when N is large.

Wait, the problem states that all apothems are of the same length 'a'. So the shape is a regular polygon with N sides, each side having the same apothem 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So, for a regular polygon, the area is (Perimeter * apothem) / 2. But perhaps that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, when the light passes through a polygonal aperture, the diffraction pattern would involve interference from all the edges. But for a large N, it approaches a circular aperture. So perhaps the diffraction pattern becomes similar to that of a circular aperture.

Wait, but the first minimum in a circular aperture (the first dark ring) is at about 1.22 λ/(π a), which is approximately 0.388 λ/a. Wait, no, wait. Let's compute 1.22 * λ / (π a). Pi is approximately 3.1416, so 1.22/3.1416 ≈ 0.388. So 0.388 λ/a is sin(theta), which under small angles is approximately theta. So theta for the first minimum is about 0.388 λ/a.

But then, what about the second minimum? Are they asking about the first two minima, i.e., the first and second minima, so the angular separation between them is the difference in their angles.

Wait, the first minimum is at m=1, and the second is at m=2. So for the circular aperture, the condition for minima is given by:

sin(theta_m) = (x_m * λ) / (π a) ), 

where x_m is the m-th zero of the derivative of the Bessel function J1. The first zero of J1' is at x_1 = 3.8317, x_2 = 7.0156, x_3 = 10.1735, etc. So for m=1, theta_1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a), as I thought earlier, which is approximately 0.609 λ/a. Wait, wait, 3.8317/(2π) is approximately 0.609. Oh wait, no, 3.8317/(2π) is 3.8317/(6.2832) ≈ 0.609. So sin(theta_1)= (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). So theta_1 is approximately 0.609 λ/a, but wait, 0.609 is approximately 2π/3.8317.

Wait, but the problem states that the angular distance between the first two minima is being asked. So the first minimum is at sin(theta_1) = 3.8317 λ/(2π a), and the second minimum is at sin(theta_2) = 7.0156 λ/(2π a). The angular separation between them would be theta_2 - theta_1.

Wait, but if we're using the small angle approximation, then theta ≈ sin(theta), so we can approximate theta_1 ≈ 3.8317 λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.609 λ/a, and theta_2 ≈ 7.0156 λ/(2π a) ≈ 7.0156/(6.2832) ≈ 1.116 λ/a. So the angular separation is theta_2 - theta_1 ≈ (1.116 - 0.609) λ/a ≈ 0.507 λ/a. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a, which is very close to this value.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit with width 'a'. But that doesn't make sense because a slit is a different shape. Alternatively, maybe the polygon can be approximated as a rectangle with width 'a' and N sides, but that's unclear.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the polygon is considered as a collection of N slits, each of width (side length of the polygon). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon has each side of length s, and the apothem is 'a'. The relation between s and a is s = 2a tan(π/N). As N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s ≈ 2a (π/N). But as N→infinite, s approaches zero, so each side becomes infinitesimally small, making the polygon a circle with radius a.

But earlier, I thought that the first minimum of the circular aperture is at about theta ≈ 0.609 λ/a, and the second is at theta ≈ 1.116 λ/a, so the separation is about 0.507 λ/a, which is option D: 0.506 λ/a.

Alternatively, if the problem is assuming that the polygon is treated as a single slit, the first minimum is at a sin(theta) = λ. So theta ≈ λ/(a). The second minimum is at 2λ/a, so the separation would be (2λ/a - λ/a) = λ/a. But that's not one of the options, so that must not be the case.

Wait, but wait, the options given include:

A) 0.610 λ /a

B) 0.500 λ /a

C)1.220 λ /a 

D) 0.506 λ /a

So option C is 1.220 λ/a, which is approximately 4/π (~1.273), but 4/π is about 1.273, which is a bit higher than 1.22. Wait, 1.22 is actually approximately 4/3.28, but I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the polygon is considered as a rectangular aperture, with each side acting as a slit. But wait, a polygon with N sides, each side having the same apothem. Hmm, but as N increases, the shape becomes a circle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit, but that doesn't make sense because a polygon isn't a slit. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon's diffraction pattern can be approximated by considering each edge as a source of Huygens' secondary waves, and the minima occur when the path difference between two adjacent edges is an odd multiple of λ/2.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', which would give the first minimum at a sin(theta) = λ. So theta ≈ λ/a. The second minimum would be at a sin(theta) = 2λ, so theta ≈ 2λ/a. The separation between them is (2λ/a - λ/a) = λ/a. But this is not among the options given, so perhaps this is not the correct approach.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options include 0.506 λ/a, which is about half a wavelength over 'a'. Hmm, but in the circular aperture, the separation between first and second minima is about 0.507 λ/a, which is very close to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering something else. Maybe when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, and the first minima are at angles determined by the single-slit formula, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when N is very large, the polygon can be approximated as a rectangle with width 'a' and height approaching infinity. But that would be an approximation of an infinitely long slit, which would have a different diffraction pattern.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The initial thought was that when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the first minima in its diffraction pattern occur at angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first two minima would be the first two zeros of J1, which are at approximately 3.8317 and 7.0156. Thus, their angular positions would be theta_1 = 3.8317 λ/(2π a) and theta_2 = 7.0156 λ/(2π a). The difference is (7.0156 - 3.8317) * λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839) * λ/(6.2832 a) ≈ 0.5065 λ/a. That's approximately 0.506 λ/a, which matches option D.

So putting it all together, the angular separation between the first two minima when N is infinitely large (i.e., the polygon becomes a circle) is approximately 0.506 λ/a. So the correct answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the diffraction pattern created by an aperture shaped as an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to \(a\). When \(N\) is infinitely large, the polygon approximates a circle with radius \(a\). The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1\), which govern the angular positions of the minima.

The angular position of the \(m\)-th minimum in a circular aperture is given by:

\[
\sin(\theta_m) = \frac{x_m \lambda}{\pi a},
\]

where \(x_m\) is the \(m\)-th zero of the derivative of the Bessel function \(J_1\). The first two zeros of \(J_1'\) are approximately \(x_1 = 3.8317\) and \(x_2 = 7.0156\). Using the small-angle approximation (\(\sin\theta \approx \theta\)), the angular positions of the first two minima are:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{x_1 \lambda}{\pi a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{x_2 \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

Substituting \(x_1 = 3.8317\) and \(x_2 = 7.0156\), we calculate:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{3.8317 \lambda}{\pi a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{7.0156 \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

The angular separation between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{\pi a}.
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\), we find:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{3.1416} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\), which corresponds to option D.
