Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power. Hmm, I need to figure out the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the power function. Let me think.

The problem states that the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating, so it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction at θ = 30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle. The formula I vaguely recall is something like the power pattern being proportional to (sinθ)^2 or something similar. Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (which this is) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) is proportional to (sinθ)^2, I think.

So the maximum power occurs when sinθ is maximum. Since sinθ reaches its maximum at θ=90 degrees, that's where the maximum intensity occurs. But wait, the problem says the maximum is A, so when θ is 90 degrees, the power is A.

But the question is asking about θ=30 degrees. So the fraction would be the intensity at 30 degrees divided by the maximum intensity (A). Let me calculate that.

The intensity at θ is proportional to sin²θ. So at θ=30 degrees, sin30 is 0.5, so sin^2(30) is 0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25 times the maximum, which is 25% of A. Wait, but wait, because the maximum is at 90 degrees, which is sin^2(90)=1. So the fraction would be (sin²30)/(sin²90) = (0.25)/(1) = 0.25, so 1/4. But wait, the options don't have 1/4 as the first part for some. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and λ^(-4), and option B is 1/4 and λ
