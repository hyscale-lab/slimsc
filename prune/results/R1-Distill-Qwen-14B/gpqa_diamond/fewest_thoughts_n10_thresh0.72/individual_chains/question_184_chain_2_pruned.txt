Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me visualize that structure.

So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). I need to figure out the sequence of reactions that would lead to this structure.

I remember that when dealing with benzene, the order of substituents matters because each substitution can affect the next due to directing effects. Benzene is initially activated towards electrophilic substitution, but substituents can change that.

Looking at the substituents:

- Ethoxy (OEt) is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group (it's an ether, so O has lone pairs). It's a strong activating group, so it's ortho/para-directing.

- tert-Butyl is a bulky alkyl group, which is activating (since alkyl groups donate electrons through induction). It's also ortho/para-directing, but being bulky, it might influence the regioselectivity.

- Nitro is a deactivating group because it's a strong electron-withdrawing group. It's meta-directing.

Wait, but the nitro group is meta-directing. So when adding the nitro group, I need to consider where it will attach relative to the existing substituents.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (tert-butyl) and position 4 (ethoxy, which is position 1 because benzene is a ring, so numbering should start from the ethoxy as position 1, then next positions go around). Wait, perhaps I should number the substituents properly.

Wait, I think the numbering is as follows: suppose the ethoxy is in position 1. Then, going clockwise, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. So the ring is substituted with OEt at 1, t-Bu at 2, and NO2 at 3.

So, how should the substituents be added?

I think we have to add the substituents in the correct order so that each new group is added in a position directed by the existing groups.

First, let's think about the order. Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it's better to add it later because it deactivates the ring, making subsequent substitutions harder. So maybe add the nitro group last.

Wait, but wait: if we add nitro last, then the ring will have two substituents (ethoxy and t-Bu) before adding nitro. But let me think about the steps.

Another approach is to determine the order in which the substituents are introduced to minimize steric hindrance and maximize yield.

Let me consider the substituents:
