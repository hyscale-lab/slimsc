Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and from that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups—so that's about molecular shapes and their symmetry elements. I remember that molecules with certain shapes have specific symmetry groups, which are classified based on their symmetry elements like axes, planes, etc.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given to figure out what the compounds are. Maybe once I know what E is, I can determine its structure and thus its symmetry group.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm trying to think of a red product that forms from a solid reacting with a gas. Oh wait, maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen? Because halogens can react with metals to form salts. But wait, from the third reaction, C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So C is a salt that breaks down into A (a metal?), and two acids F and G.

Wait, let's think. If C is a salt that, when reacted with water, produces a metal and two acids, then C is probably a sulfide or something similar? No, because sulfides usually react with water to produce H2S and the metal hydroxide or something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate? Or maybe it's something like a sulfate? Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong and a weak acid. Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, their conjugate bases would be weak and strong, respectively. So if C is a salt, then it's probably a salt that has a cation from a strong base and an anion from a weak acid. Because when that salt dissolves in water, it would produce the strong base's cation and the weak acid's anion. But in the third reaction, when C reacts with water, it produces A (solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, perhaps C is a salt that includes A+ and (F-G acid) anions.

Wait, maybe C is sodium sulfide?
