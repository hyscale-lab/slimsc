Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions can be calculated using the heat of neutralization data.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is typically around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, some might have different values depending on the acid and base. For example, sulfuric acid is a strong acid, but since it's diprotic, each H+ ion contributes to the neutralization.

So the problem gives three solutions:

1. 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it should dissociate completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

2. 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 moles of H+.

3. 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole gives 2 moles of OH- because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So the first thing I need to do is figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions in each solution.

Let's start with HCl:

Moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters)
HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

H2SO4: Each mole gives 2 H+.

Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: Each mole gives 2 OH-.

Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait a minute. The reaction is acid + base. So I need to find the moles of H+ from acids and OH- from bases.

Wait, wait, the problem says mixing all three, but HCl and H2SO4 are acids, Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the H+ will come from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent here would be OH-, since 0.2 < 0.28. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

But wait, wait! Wait a second. Let me make sure I'm calculating this right. The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 might be more complex. Because H2SO4 is diprotic.

Wait, but when you mix a strong acid and a strong base, the neutralization is straightforward. So, H+ from both acids will react with OH- from the base.

So total H+ available is 0.28, and OH- is 0.2.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react,
