Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA, right? So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, what's the formation constant about? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) represents how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable, so it doesn't dissociate much.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. I think this is the concentration of the complex itself. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because of the formation constant, some of it might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the dissociation. The reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−

Wait no, wait. Actually, the complex is Ca-EDTA. So the formula would be Ca-EDTA^2- because EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form when it binds. So the complex is CaEDTA²−. So the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure. EDTA has multiple protons, but in the complex, it's usually in a deprotonated form. So the complex is Ca(EDTA)^2−, and when it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the reaction is correct.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5x10^10. But wait, some sources define Kf as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA²− ; Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

So in this case, the complex is 0.02 M. Assuming that the amount of dissociation is very small because Kf is large, so the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be very low. But is that the case?

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote some variables.

Let’s let the concentration of the complex at equilibrium be C. But wait, when the complex dissociates, each mole releases one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So if x is the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium, then the concentration of EDTA^4− is also x. And the concentration of the complex is 0.02 - x. But since Kf is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so x would be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So the expression for Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.

So solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)
x² = 4e-13 (since 0.02 is 2e-2, 2e-2 /5e10 = 4e-13)

Taking the square root:

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ? Wait, wait. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4) * 10^(-13/2) = 2 * 10^-6.5.

Wait, 10^-6 is 1e-6, and 10^-7 is 1e-7. So 10^-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. Which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches.

Wait a second, but let me think again. The problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming x is the concentration that dissociates, so:

[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So plugging into Kf:

Kf = (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.

So x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*(1e-13), sqrt of 4 is 2, sqrt of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5 (since sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6, so sqrt(1e-13) is 3.16e-7). So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Which is option C, 6.3e-7 M.

So yes, the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([ \text{CaEDTA}^{2-} ]\) is approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since the dissociation is expected to be minimal due to the large \( K_f \)). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium. Then:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Substituting \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
