Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian of an interaction term and I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basics.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that γ matrices are dimensionless in four dimensions. But wait, the mass dimension is important here.

So, the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless. Each term in the Lagrangian must have the same dimension.

Let me think about each part of the term. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So I need to find the mass dimension of each component.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of ψ in four dimensions is 3/2, because the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. So m has dimension 1, and ∂_μ has dimension 1, so ψ must have dimension 3/2 each.

So ψ̄ has the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3 each.

Now σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is antisymmetric in μν. The commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] has dimension zero because gamma matrices are dimensionless. So σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless.

Then F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor of electromagnetism or Yang-Mills. The field strength tensor F has terms like ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu plus [A_mu, A_nu] for non-abelian, but for electromagnetism, it's just ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1 (since it's like a gauge field, similar to a vector potential, which in four dimensions has dimension 1). So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

So the dimensions of each part:

ψ̄ has 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the product is (3/2) * 0 (wait no, σ is part of the term, but σ is dimensionless, so the product is (3/2 + 3/2) + 2) ?

Wait, maybe I should think of each part's dimension. Let me break it down:

Each ψ̄ ψ term: (3/2) + (3/2) = 3.

Multiply by F^{mu nu}, which is dimension 2. So 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the entire term is κ times the product of those.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions:

ψ̄ (3/2) * σ (0) * ψ (3/2) * F (2) → 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, wait. No, the product would be (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 → wait, no, the σ is in between, but it's dimensionless. So the product is (3/2) * (3/2) ) from ψ̄ and ψ, and then F is 2. So (3) * (2) = 6? Wait no, that's not
