Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. So, the starting material is cyclohexanone, which I remember is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. The steps are as follows:

1. Cyclohexanone treated with bromine forms product 1.
2. Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide to form product 2.
3. Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride and pyridine to form product 3.
4. Product 3 is treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(LiAlH3- but wait, no, LiAlH3 is different. Wait, no, LiAlH4 is the common one, but this is a different reagent. Oh wait, wait—LiAlH with three t-butoxy groups. So it's a stronger reducing agent than LiAlH4? Or maybe it's used under different conditions. Not sure yet, but I'll think more about that later.

The question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. So I have to track each reaction and figure out the structure each time, then look at product 4's structure to count distinct H atoms.

Let's go step by step.

First reaction: cyclohexanone + bromine (Br2).

Cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When you treat a ketone with bromine, what happens? I think when ketones react with Br2, it's a bromination, maybe via enolate. Wait, wait another thought: cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Adding bromine might lead to a dihalide. Oh, right! The reaction of ketones with Br2 typically involves the formation of a dibromide through the enol mechanism. So the ketone oxygen is attacked by Br, but since it's a cyclic ketone, the bromine adds across the carbonyl group, making a geminal dibromide. Wait, no, wait—another possibility: if the ketone is treated with bromine, perhaps it undergoes bromination via an enol intermediate. But in the case of cyclohexanone, I believe the reaction is more likely to form a vicinal dihalide. Wait, no, wait. Another thought: the bromine adds to the carbonyl group, so the carbonyl becomes a bromide. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation. No, wait, bromohydrin is when there's water present. Alternatively, when you treat a ketone with brom
