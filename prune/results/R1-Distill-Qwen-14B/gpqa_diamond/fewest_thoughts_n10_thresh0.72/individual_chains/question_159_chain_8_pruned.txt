Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their spectra, and I need to figure out the comoving distance based on some cosmological parameters. Hmm, let's see. 

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that the peak wavelength of emission can be related to the redshift of the object. Oh right! It's something to do with the Lyman-alpha forest or maybe the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, Lyman-alpha is when hydrogen emits at about 121 nm, right? So if the observed wavelength is longer, that's because of redshift.

So the quasar's emission line is being observed at 790 nm. Let me think, the rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is 790 nm. So the redshift z would be (lambda_obs / lambda_rest) - 1. Let me calculate that: 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So 6.5 - 1 = 5.5. So z is about 5.5? Or wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh wait, no, the formula for redshift is z = (lambda_obs / lambda_emit) - 1. So yes, that's correct.

So z is approximately 5.5. Now, the next part is about the comoving distance. The question gives the cosmological parameters: Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density omega_m is 0.3, dark energy omega_lambda is 0.7, and the universe is flat. So we need to find the comoving distance at scale factor a=1, which I think is the same as the current comoving distance to the source.

I remember that the comoving distance D_C is related to the integral of 1/(H(a)) da from a=0 to a=1/(1+z), because a=1/(1+z) for a given redshift. Wait, no, actually, the scale factor a is such that when the light was emitted, the scale factor was a_e = 1/(1+z). So the comoving distance is the integral from a_e to a=1 of c/H(a) * da / a? Or maybe it's the integral of c/H(a) da from a_e to a=1, multiplied by (1+z) or something. Wait, no, I think the comoving distance is the integral from a=0 to a= a_e of c/H(a) * (da / a). Wait, not sure. Let me get the formula correct.

Ah, right, the comoving distance is given by D_C = (c/H0) * ∫ [1/(E(a))] da from a=0 to a = a_e, where a_e = 1/(1+z). And E(a) is sqrt(omega_m/a^3 + omega_lambda * (a)^(3(1+w)) ), but since dark energy is a cosmological constant, w=-1, so (1+w)=0. So E(a) becomes sqrt(omega_m/a^3 + omega_lambda). But wait, no, E(a) is usually defined as sqrt( (omega_m/a^3) + (omega_lambda) ), since a^3(1+w) when w=-1 becomes a^0=1. So yeah, E(a) = sqrt( (omega_m / a^3) + omega_lambda ) + omega_r a etc., but for this problem, I think only matter and dark energy are considered, and radiation is negligible or zero.

So the integral becomes ∫ [1 / sqrt( (0.3/a^3) + 0.7 ) ] da from a=0 to a=1/(1+z). Wait, but I'm not sure how to compute this integral exactly. It's not one of the standard forms I remember. Maybe I need to use a look-up table or an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use an approximate formula for the comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

Another approach: The formula for the comoving distance for a given redshift z in a flat universe is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫_0^z [1 / E(z')] dz'

Where E(z') = sqrt( omega_m (1 + z')^3 + omega_lambda )

Wait, yes, that's another way to express it. Because when you make a substitution from a to z, you can express it in terms of z. So E(z) = sqrt( (omega_m (1 + z)^3) + omega_lambda ). 

So the integral is from 0 to z of 1 / E(z') dz'. So the integral is ∫ [1 / sqrt( 0.3(1+z')^3
