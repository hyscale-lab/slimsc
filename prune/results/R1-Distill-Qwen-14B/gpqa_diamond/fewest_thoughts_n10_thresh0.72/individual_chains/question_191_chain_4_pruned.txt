Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound given is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2)=, wait no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH2-CH(CH2?), no. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)CH2CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH3)-, right? Because propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent would be the double bond at 1, so the substituent would be CH2-C(CH3)=, no. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)CH2 attached to the cyclohexane? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on.

The first reaction: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, usually used for deprotonating things. And benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So I think the cyclohexanone is being alkylated.

But wait, where is the acidic proton? In the presence of a ketone, the alpha hydrogens are acidic. So the hydroxymethyl group has an OH. So the -CH2OH group has alpha hydrogens (the CH2 part). Sodium hydride would deprotonate the alpha position, creating an enolate, which then attacks the benzyl bromide. So the enolate would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to alkylation.

Wait, the starting material has a ketone (cyclohexan-1-one). The adjacent carbons are
