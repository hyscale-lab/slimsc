Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4 after a series of reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize this structure. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring, right? At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group with the double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached to C2. So, it's CH2CH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2, but attached to C2. Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CH-CH2-, but the substituent is on C2? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2)-, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2 with a double bond starting at C1, so it's CH2=CHCH2— but attached to the cyclohexane ring at the middle carbon. So, the substituent is on C2 of the propene group. So, the structure would be cyclohexanone with a substituent at position 3 (–CH2OH) and at position 5 (a group that's CH2–C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. Alternatively, perhaps it's (prop-1-en-2-yl) is CH2=C(CH2–)-. Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CHCH2– but attached at the second carbon. Wait, no, the substituent is on the second carbon of the propenyl group. So, the structure is a cyclohexanone ring, with a hydroxymethyl at C3 and an allyl group (CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond) attached to C5. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group is actually CH2–
