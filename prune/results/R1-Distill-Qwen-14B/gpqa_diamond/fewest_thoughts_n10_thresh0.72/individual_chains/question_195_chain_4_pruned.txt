Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there's an astronomer observing a planet. This planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times that of the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. They want to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet so that both transit and occultation events can occur. Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that for a planet to transit (eclipse the star from our point of view), it needs to pass directly in front of the star. The transit impact parameter is the measure of how close the planet's path comes to the center of the star. A lower impact parameter means a closer approach, making it more likely to transit.

But wait, what about occultation? Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so it's hidden from view. For that to happen, the planet must be larger than the star in terms of angular size, or at least that the star can cover it when it's behind. Wait, no, occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the star blocks the planet's light. But for that to happen, the orbital distance must be such that the star can eclipse the planet. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, occultation is when the planet is behind the star from our perspective, so the star is in front. So the planet must be within the star's apparent size, or else the star can't block it. Or maybe it's the other way around â€” if the planet is too far, the star can't cover it, so we can't see the occultation.

But wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. For a planet to both transit and
