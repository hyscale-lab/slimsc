Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and mutant genes. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the problem describes a situation where there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The question shows the wild-type gene sequence and four mutant sequences. The task is to determine which mutation would likely disable the gene responsible for the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think this is about finding a mutation that causes a loss-of-function, like a premature stop codon or something disrupting the protein structure.

Looking at the wild-type sequence: It starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The sequence continues with various codons, and ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So, the gene is properly structured.

Now, each mutant has differences in the first part of the sequence, around the first exon. Let's look at each mutant's changes.

Mutant 1:
The sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.
Comparing to wild type, the first few differences are at positions where the wild type has "TTT CT C". Wait, let me look again.

Wait, the wild type starts as:
ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant 1 has:
ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the wild type has TTTCTC, and the mutant has TCTACG. Let me count the nucleotides. From the start:

Wild type:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG...

Wait, perhaps I should look at the codons to see if there's a frameshift or a substitution.

Looking at the wild type's first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

Mutant 1's first part:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG...

Wait, let's compare codon by codon.

Wild type first few codons:
ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
G...

Mutant 1:
ATG
TTT
CTA (Leu)
CGC (Arg)
TGG (Trp)
...

Wait, so starting from the third codon, wild type is CTC (Leu), and mutant 1 has CTA (Leu as well, since CTA is Leu). Then the next codon in wild type is GCT (Ala), but in mutant 1, it's CGC (Arg). So substitution from Ala to Arg. Then next codon in wild type is GGT (Gly), but in mutant 1, it's TGG (Trp). So another substitution.

So in mutant 1, the third codon is same, but fourth and fifth codons are changed.

But does that cause a frameshift? No. Because the substitution changes are in the same reading frame. So the reading frame isn't disrupted, just some amino acids are changed. So unless one of these changes introduces a premature stop codon, the protein might still be made, just with some mutations. So unless it's a nonsense mutation, which would stop translation early.

Wait, let's check the stop codon in the wild type. It ends with TGA. So in mutant 1, does the stop codon change? Let me see. The end of the sequence for mutant 1 is TCGT…TGA. So the stop codon is same, TGA. So no premature stop.

So for mutant 1, there are some amino acid substitutions but no frameshift, no stop codon. So probably the protein is made but altered. Whether that disrupts the compound's synthesis depends on the function, but probably not a complete loss.

Mutant 2:
ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Looking at the codons:

Wild type starts with ATG, then TTT, CTC, GCT, etc.

Mutant 2's sequence: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG...

So, first codon is same. Second is same (TTT). Third codon in wild type is CTC (Leu), mutant 2 has CTA (Leu again). Next wild type is GCT (Ala), mutant 2 has AGC (Ser). Then wild type is GGT (Gly), mutant 2 has TGG (Trp).

So in mutant 2, the fourth codon changes from Ala to Ser, and fifth from Gly to Trp. Again, same frame, so no frameshift. So perhaps similar to mutant 1, just some amino acid changes. No stop codon change.

Mutant 3:
ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Looking at the codons:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...

Wait, let me break it down. Let's see:

Wild type:
ATG (M)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
...

Mutant3's sequence:
ATG (same)
TTT (same)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
GTC (Val)
ACT (Thr)
...

Wait, so after TTT, the next codons are TAC, GCT, GGT, etc. So in wild type, after TTT comes CTC, but in mutant3, it's TAC. So that's a substitution from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). So that changes the amino acid from Leu to Tyr. Then the next codon in wild type is GCT (Ala),
