Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth as the planet orbits it, right?

The question says that two stars with the same mass as our Sun have each been found to have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV shifts are given: planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. They want to know how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, but also on other factors like the inclination of the orbit (but since both are detected, maybe we can assume the same inclination? Or perhaps it's not needed here.)

I remember that the RV method's signal is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1 / (P^(1/3))), something like that. Wait, maybe more accurately, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period and semi-major axis. Let me think. The formula I recall is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * c ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )) / P^(1/3) )

Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, a simplified version when the planet is much less massive than the star (which is true here since Neptune is much less than the Sun). So M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

I think the semi-amplitude K is given by: K ≈ ( ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M
