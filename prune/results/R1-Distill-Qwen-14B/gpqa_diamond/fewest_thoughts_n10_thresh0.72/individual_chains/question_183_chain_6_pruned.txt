Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a certain reaction. Hmm. Let's break it down.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering is probably such that the cyclohexene part is the main ring. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

At position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is a CHO group. So, attached to the second carbon of the cyclohexene ring is a carbonyl group. Then, at position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH₂CH₂, but wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So that's a double bond attached to the ring.

Wait, the parent is cyclohex-3-ene, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. So the ring has a double bond there, and substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl).

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, no, that's for removing carbonyl groups by reducing them to methylene groups. Alternatively, red phosphorus is involved in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but more likely, in this case, it's part of the reaction that converts carbonyl groups into something else, maybe in the presence of HI.

Wait, another thought: when a carbonyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to perform a nucleophilic addition. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogenation. Or wait, I think the reaction is the Clemmensen reduction. Oh wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. But the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps it's the Wolff-Kishner conditions, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. Red phosphorus and HI are used to convert carbonyl groups into alkanes. So for example
