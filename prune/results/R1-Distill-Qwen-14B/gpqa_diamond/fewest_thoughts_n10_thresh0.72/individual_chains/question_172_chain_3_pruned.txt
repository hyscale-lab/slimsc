Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this.

Alright, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. So, I should probably use the Boltzmann equation here because it deals with the distribution of particles in energy states.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). Right, where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, it's about the excitation of iron atoms. So probably, the energy levels are i (excited) and j (ground state), and the statistical weights are given or can be considered the same if not stated otherwise. Wait, the problem says the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So for star_1, the ratio n_i/n_j is twice that of star_2. Or wait, maybe more accurately, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, the question states that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. So I think that means the excitation level is higher, so the population in the higher energy level is higher. So for star_1, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) = 2 times that of star_2. So, (n_i1)/(n_i2) = 2. Wait, noâ€”wait, perhaps the ratio for each star is being compared. Let me think.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase: For star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice as much as in star_2. So, if for star_2, the ratio is (n_i2)/(n_j2), then for star_1, it's (n_i1)/(n_j
