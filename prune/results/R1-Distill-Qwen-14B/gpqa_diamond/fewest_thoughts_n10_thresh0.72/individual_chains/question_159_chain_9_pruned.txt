Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops a lot. I remember that when we observe distant objects, their light can be redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. Redshift means that the wavelength stretches, so if the peak is at 790 nm, maybe the rest frame of the quasar has a shorter wavelength, like in the optical range.

Wait, the peak at 790 nm is in the near-infrared. So what does that mean about its redshift? Let me think. For a quasar, if the rest wavelength is, say, 550 nm (green), and it's observed at 790 nm, the redshift z would be (790 - 550)/550. Let me compute that: (240)/550 ≈ 0.436. So z is about 0.436. Or wait, another way: if the observed wavelength is longer, the formula is z = (observed λ / rest λ) -1. So if the rest λ is, say, 550 nm, and observed is 790, then z = (790/550)-1 ≈ 1.436 -1 = 0.436. Or maybe the peak is in the rest frame near the optical, perhaps at 650 nm or so. Let me think about typical emission lines. The Lyman alpha line is around 121 nm in rest frame, but that's in UV, so for distant quasars, that would be redshifted into optical. Wait, but the peak here is at 790 nm, which is near-infrared. I'm a bit confused about the rest wavelength, but I think the idea is that the redshift z is about 0.4 or so.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is a way to measure the distance to an object in the universe, considering the expansion of space. The formula for comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters. In a flat universe (which is given here), the comoving distance D_C is given by an integral involving the Hubble parameter.

The parameters given are H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m = 0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ = 0.7. So the universe is flat (Ω_m + Ω_Λ = 1). 

The comoving distance for a given redshift z is calculated using the integral from 0 to z of c / (H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r(1+z')^4 + Ω_m(1+z')^3 + Ω_k(1+z')^2 + Ω_Λ). But since the universe is flat and assuming no radiation-dominated era (or at least Ω_r is negligible), E(z
