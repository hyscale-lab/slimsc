Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm... The question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let's break it down.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has charge 2e. All right. The particles have negligible mass, so we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy perhaps.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Wait, so the point P has a charge fixed there—so that's the 13th charge. The 12 charges are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of r = 2m from the fixed charge.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy. I remember that for a system of charges, the total electrical potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Oh right, because each pair contributes to the total energy.

But wait, since the system is isolated, we're only considering their mutual electrostatic potential energy. So I need to calculate the potential energy for all possible pairs.

Let me think. There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2 meters
