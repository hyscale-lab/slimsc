Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I remember that mixing acids and bases can neutralize each other. Let me break it down.

First, I'll write down the given information. The volumes and concentrations are:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid)
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base because when they're mixed, they'll react. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

Let me compute each one:

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

But wait, wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely, unlike HCl, which is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

Wait, but when mixing acids and bases, the H+ ions and OH- ions will react. So, perhaps the first thing is to find the total moles of H+ and OH- in the solution.

Hmm, but I need to be careful because the H+ from HCl is strong, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is strong. The acetic acid's H+ is weak, so maybe it's better to consider neutralization reactions first between the strong acid and strong base, then see what's left, and then consider the weak acid's contribution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the total H+ and total OH- first, see which is in excess, and proceed from there. Let me try that.

Let me find the moles of H+ and OH-:

First, from HCl: it's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each HCl gives 1 H+.

Moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles.

From CH3COOH: it's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate much. But the H+ it contributes is negligible compared to the strong acid and base, perhaps. Or maybe not? Wait, but when I mix all these, the presence of OH- will neutralize some of the H+ from HCl, and any leftover OH- will react with the acetic acid. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- is 0.18 moles. So when they mix, H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the moles of H+ initially are 0.08, OH- 0.18. Let's subtract.

Let me compute the net OH- after reaction with H+:

H+ = 0.08, OH- = 0.18.

So 0.08 moles H+ will react with 0.08 moles OH- to form water. That leaves 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, but wait. Also, the acetic acid's H+ might contribute, but I'm not sure if that's significant. Because OH- is a strong base and will deprotonate anything it can, including the weak acid. So after neutralizing the H+ from HCl, the remaining OH- will react with the acetic acid.

So now, after HCl and Ba(OH)2 have reacted, there's 0.10 moles of OH- left. Then, that OH- will react with the acetic acid.

Wait, but acetic acid is CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. The OH- will deprotonate it, right? So the reaction would be:

OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So the moles of OH- left are 0.10, and the moles of CH3COOH are 0.05.

Which one is in excess? The OH- is 0.10, and CH3COOH is 0.05. So the OH- will neutralize all the CH3COOH.

So, all 0.05 moles of CH3COOH will react, leaving:

OH-: 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles.

So after all reactions, we have 0.05 moles of OH- left, and the total volume is the sum of all the solutions.

Wait, what's the total volume? Let me compute that.

500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So now, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH is calculated as -log10(0.0416667), and then pH is 14 - pOH.

Wait, let's compute that.

pOH = -log(0.0416
