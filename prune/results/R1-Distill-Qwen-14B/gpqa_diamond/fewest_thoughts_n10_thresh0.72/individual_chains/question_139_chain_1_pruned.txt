Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to choose the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when certain compounds react with HCl, NaNO2, and water, it's usually related to diazotization or some kind of oxidation. Wait, wait. Diazonium salts are involved in reactions like the Sandmeyer reaction, but that's typically for aromatic amines. Oh wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh right! The treatment with HCl, NaNO2, and water is often used in the formation of carbonyl groups. Oh wait, maybe it's the Stephen reduction or something else? Hmm, no, wait.

Wait a second, I think this is about the hydrolysis of a nitrile or maybe an elimination reaction. Or wait, could it be the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that involves ketones and introduces an oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is a diol, treatment with HCl and nitrous acid might lead to the formation of a ketone via the elimination of water. Oh right! I think that's the case. For diols, especially vicinal diols (dihydroxy on adjacent carbons), when treated with acid, they can undergo elimination to form a carbonyl group. So, more specifically, under acidic conditions, vicinal diols can lose two water molecules to form a ketone or aldehyde, depending on the structure.

Wait, but wait, the reagents here are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Oh wait, sodium nitrite in HCl is a source of nitrous acid (HNO2). Wait, but in the presence of diols, perhaps it's an oxidation? Or maybe it's a different process.

Wait, another reaction comes to mind. The oxidation of alcohols to ketones or aldehydes. But that usually requires something like KMnO4 or CrO3 under acidic conditions. But then, what about the reaction of a secondary alcohol with nitrous acid and H
