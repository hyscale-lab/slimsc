Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question involves a series of reactions starting with a specific compound and ending with product 4. I need to figure out what product 4 looks like based on the reactions described.

First, the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that structure. So it's a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so a CH2OH attached), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group, right? So it's CH2CHCH2 with the double bond between C1 and C2, and attached at the middle carbon. So the substituent at position 5 is an allyl group, maybe in a sort of isopropyl arrangement? Hmm, maybe it's more like (CH2)CH2 attached? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, actually, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- but that's not possible because propene has three carbons. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CCH2-? Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2 but that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CH-CH2 where the middle carbon is attached to the cyclohexane, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the cyclohexane? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl group would be: the group is CH2CH(CH2-) with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The group is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2=C-CH2-, but where is it attached? The substituent is attached at the 2 position of propene, so the cyclohexane is attached to the middle carbon, making it an allyl group attached as
