Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem goes like this:

Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Additionally, gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question is asking about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, okay. So probably I need to figure out what E is, and then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions.

First, solid A + 8 B → C (bright red). What reaction involves solid and gas in such a stoichiometry? Maybe something like a metal reacting with a halogen. For example, sodium (solid) reacting with chlorine gas. Wait, but 8 equivalents? That's a lot. Maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with something? Or perhaps a transition metal reacting with chlorine.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a metal with chlorine gas. Suppose A is a metal, B is Cl2. For example, aluminum reacts with chlorine gas to form AlCl3. But aluminum reacts in a 3:3 ratio (I think). Wait, 8 equivalents for B—so maybe 8 moles of B per mole of A.

Wait, but for a reaction like Fe3O4 reacting with Cl2? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal that forms an 8+ charge? That seems unlikely. Wait, maybe it's a metal that forms a +2 ion, and B is Cl2, each Cl is -1. So 8 Cl would require a metal with a +8 charge. That sounds way too high. Unlikely.

Wait, another approach: the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like sulfur (which is bright red when in powder form), but in a compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal complex. Or maybe a compound like CuSO4·5H2O is blue, but when it's dehydrated, it's white. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a compound with a lot of delocalized electrons, giving it a red color. For example, maybe it's a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but I'm not sure about red.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of solid sodium (Na) with chlorine gas (Cl2) would produce NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 8. Hmm. Wait, maybe the metal is something else. Let's think about the formation of a metal chloride with a high number of chlorides. For example, zinc forms ZnCl2 in a 1:2 ratio. Hmm, but not 8.

Wait, let me think again. Another possibility: solid A might be a metal oxide. For example, maybe A is FeO, and B is Cl2, but the reaction seems off. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal sulfide reacting with Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A and two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it produces a metal (A), a strong acid, and a weak acid. Let's see: for example, if C were a sulfide, then reacting with water might produce a metal, H2S (which is a weak acid), and maybe another acid. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if C is a nitride, then reacting with water would produce NH3, which is a weak base, but not an acid.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a sulfite or sulfate. Let me think—if C is a sulfate, then reacting with water would give the corresponding acid. But I'm not
