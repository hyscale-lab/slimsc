Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, in spectroscopic observations, the radial velocities (RVs) of the stars show sinusoidal variations. 

For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Also, the mass of a system is the sum of the masses of the two stars.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shifts, which gives the velocities of the stars relative to us. The larger the velocity amplitude, the more massive the companion because a more massive star would have a smaller orbit (since they orbit the center of mass together).

Wait, let's think about this. The mass function relates the velocities and the orbital period to the masses. I think the formula involves the velocity amplitudes and the period. Or maybe it's Kepler's third law.

I recall that Kepler's third law in the context of binary systems states that (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3, where a is the separation between the two stars. But I'm not sure about the exact relation here.

Another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula is something like K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but since the inclination i is the same for both systems (as they eclipse, so i is 90 degrees, sin i =1), we can maybe ignore that part.

Wait, but in the problem, each system has two stars, so each star's velocity is related to the other
