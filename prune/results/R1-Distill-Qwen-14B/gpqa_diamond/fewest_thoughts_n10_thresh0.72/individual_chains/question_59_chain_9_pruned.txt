Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. The options are all numbers, so I need to calculate the pH after mixing. Let me think through the steps.

Alright, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. Then, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, that's hydrochloric acid, a strong acid. And finally, 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2, which is barium hydroxide, a strong base. 

I remember that when acids and bases are mixed, they undergo a neutralization reaction. So first, I should find out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions after mixing all the solutions. Wait, but each solution contributes different things.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the moles of each component in each solution.

For CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L (500 mL). Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of acetic acid.

HCl: 0.2 M, volume 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- is 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, the total volume when all are mixed is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

But before that, I need to figure out the net reaction between the acids and the base. Since HCl is a strong acid and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, they'll neutralize each other first. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it might not react with the base if there's any excess.

Let me write down the reactions.

HCl (strong acid) reacting with Ba(OH)2 (strong base):

The neutralization reaction between HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O

So for every 2 moles of HCl, 1 mole of Ba(OH)2 is consumed. 

But wait, how many moles of HCl and Ba(OH)2 do we have?

HCl: 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)
