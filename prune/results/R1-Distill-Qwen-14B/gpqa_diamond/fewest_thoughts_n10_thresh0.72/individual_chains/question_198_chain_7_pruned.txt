Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I think this involves the formation of complexes and using stability constants to find the fraction of each complex. The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN^- ligands. So, Co(SCN)₂²+?

Stability constants (formation constants) tell us how much a complex will form. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the first step is to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations.

The possible complexes are:
- Co²+ (free ion)
- Co(SCN)⁺ (monothiocyanato)
- Co(SCN)₂²+ (dithiocyanato)
- Co(SCN)₃^0 (trithiocyanato)
- Co(SCN)₄^2- (tetrathiocyanato)

Each of these has a corresponding β value. The β for each is given as β1=9 (probably Co(SCN)), β2=40 (Co(SCN)₂), β3=63 (Co(SCN)₃), β4=16 (Co(SCN)₄). Wait, but the order might be different. I should make sure I get the numbering correct. Oh wait, in some conventions, the subscript in the formula corresponds to the order. So β1 is the first complex, β2 the second, etc. So Co(SCN) has β1=9, Co(SCN)₂ has β2=40, etc.

But wait, the problem states the stability constants for the complexes, and I think each β corresponds to the stepwise formation constant. So β1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / [Co²+][SCN^-], and β2 = [Co(SCN)₂²+]/[Co(SCN)]+ [SCN^-], and so on.

But another approach is to think in terms of the overall formation constants. The overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs up to that point.

Wait, no. The stability constant (β) for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the metal ion and ligands. So for Co(SCN)₂²+:

The formation would be Co²+ + 2 SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)₂²+.

The overall β for this complex is [Co(SCN)₂²+]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^2). So the given β2 is 40, which is the overall β for the dithiocyanato complex.

Similarly, β3=63 is the overall β for the trithiocyanato complex, and
