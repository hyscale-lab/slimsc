Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

We have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle that moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measure the particles' positions, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. But wait, the wave function here has an imaginary part, right? Because of the -0.5i term. Oh, but wait, in the region where the particle exists, the wave function must be normalized. Or maybe only the real part is considered? No, I think the wave function is a complex function, but the probability is the modulus squared.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex number. So the probability density would be the square of the absolute value of this. Let me think: |ψ|^2 = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you have ψ = A + Bi, |ψ|^2 = A² + B².

But then, wait, the way the wave function is written, is the entire term multiplied by some constants? Let me make sure I'm interpreting the equation correctly. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So yes, it's a complex function. So, the modulus squared would be (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, the wave function's modulus squared must integrate to 1 over the region where the particle exists, from x=1 to x=3. Because probabilities must sum to 1.

So the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from 1 to 3 should equal 1.

So, the integral becomes the sum of two terms:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x)] dx + Integral from 1 to3 of (0.5)^2 dx.

Wait, no. Because the modulus squared is (a/(sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2. So yes, each term is squared
