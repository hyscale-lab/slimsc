Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, the problem says astronaut A has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. Astronaut B has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, same direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their speeds, right? Because at high speeds, you can't just use the classical velocity addition formula. Oh right, I remember there's a relativistic velocity addition formula. Let me recall that formula.

The formula is v_rel = (v_A - v_B) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/(cÂ²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, if they're moving in the same direction, then the relative speed of A as seen from B would be v_A minus v_B divided by that denominator. Or is it the other way around? Because relative velocity depends on the frame you're in.

Wait, the problem asks for the relative speed between them. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Or from B's perspective, how fast is A moving? Because relative speed is frame-dependent, but perhaps the question is just asking the difference in their speeds as per one frame, but no, wait, that's not right. Because they're moving in the same frame, but the relative speed in the frame of one astronaut would require using the relativistic velocity addition.

Wait, no, the problem says, "what will be the relative speed." So perhaps it's the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Let me think. So, for example, from astronaut A's frame, what's the speed of astronaut B?

So using the velocity addition formula. So if in the lab frame (let's say Earth frame), A is moving at u = 0.6c, and B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction. Then, the velocity of B as observed from A's frame would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c^2)).
