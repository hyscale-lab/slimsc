Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products are formed.

First, I should probably draw the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1-bromobenzene would be bromobenzene, right? But then the "2-d" part. Oh, maybe that's deuterated. Like, deuterium somewhere. Hmm, perhaps it's 2-deutero-1-bromobenzene. So the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br at position 1 and D (deuterium) at position 2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Also, in aromatic substitution reactions, especially elimination or perhaps some kind of aromatic substitution. Oh wait, since we're dealing with a benzene ring with substituents, maybe it's an elimination or a substitution. Wait, but bromobenzene itself isn't very reactive towards substitution because the ring is deactivated by the bromine. So perhaps this isn't a typical substitution.

Wait, wait a second. The reagent is NaNH2 and ammonia. That sounds familiar for elimination reactions, like in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. But wait, this is an aromatic compound. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo elimination.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let's think about what the starting material is. 1-bromobenzene has a bromine attached to the benzene ring. But wait, bromine is a good leaving group, but in aromatic substitution, to have a substitution reaction, the ring needs to be activated. But in this case, the ring is deactivated because bromine is an electron-withdrawing group.

So maybe the reaction isn't on the aromatic ring. Or perhaps it's a different kind of substitution.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes when you have a benzyl halide, you can do elimination, but in this case, the bromine is directly attached to the benzene ring. That's a bit different. So perhaps we're looking at a dehydrohalogenation, but on the benzene ring? That doesn't make much sense
