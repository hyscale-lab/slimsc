Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average value you'd measure if you measured the system many times. Right, the formula for the expectation value of an operator is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by the operator multiplied by the state itself. Or wait, maybe it's the bra-ket notation, like ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩. Oh yeah, that's right. So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated using this formula.

The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, wait, so that's a two-component vector. Let me think, the spin state is usually written as a two-component vector because the spin-½ system has two possible states. So the state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. But wait, I should probably normalize it first, right? Because the state needs to be a unit vector for probabilities to add up to 1. Let me check the normalization. The inner product of ψ with itself is (3i)*( -3i) + 4*4, because I think the inner product is ψ†ψ. Wait, no, wait. The inner product is the conjugate transpose of ψ multiplied by ψ. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] because (3i)* is -3i. So the inner product is (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4). Wait, no, the first component is (-3i)*(3i) which is (-3i)(3i) = -9i², and i² is -1, so that's -9*(-1)=9. The second term is 4*4=16. So 9+16=25. So the norm is 25, so the normalized state is (3i/5, 4/5). Oh wait, but wait, maybe the question assumes it's already normalized? Hmm, the problem says it's in the spin state (3i,4), but perhaps they just want us to proceed without normalizing because maybe the expectation value calculation doesn't require normalization. Wait, but no, the expectation value formula includes normalization. Because the state vector's norm affects the probabilities.

Wait, wait, no. Because the expectation value formula uses the state as given. So if the state isn't normalized, the expectation value will account for that. So I think I should proceed without normalizing first. Let me think: the state is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ψ† σ_y ψ. Because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, right? Oh, because the spin operators are S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, S_y = ħ/2 σ_y, and S_z = ħ/2 σ_z. So the operator for S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y.

So first, I need to compute ψ† multiplied by σ_y, and then multiply by ψ, and then multiply by ħ/2.

Given that σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let's write down ψ as a column vector: [3i, 4]^T.

Wait, but let's compute ψ† σ_y ψ. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] because the conjugate transpose of [3i,4]^T is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† σ_y is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by σ_y.

Let me compute that matrix multiplication. σ_y is 2x2, so the multiplication should give a row vector.

So first element of ψ† σ_y is (-3i)*(0) + 4*(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

Second element is (-3i)*(-
