Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula should be something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (time dilation factor) multiplied by the velocity.

But wait, wait. The mean decay length L is given by L = c * γ * τ * β, where β is v/c. And τ is the proper lifetime, right? But how do I find τ?

Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that the width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ would be ħ / Γ.

But wait, the width is given in MeV, and I need to convert units properly. Let me see. I think Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But I also remember that when
