Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The question is giving me a specific density matrix and asking about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates.

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh, right! That looks familiar. I think that's a classical example of a completely mixed state. Because when you have a density matrix that's a mixture of the basis states, it's a maximally mixed state for a single qubit.

So, what does that mean geometrically? I remember that for qubits, the state space is a Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me think. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ| can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r has a magnitude of 1 because the state is on the surface of the Bloch sphere. But for a mixed state, r would be smaller than 1 or maybe zero.

Looking back at the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute what that is in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I for a qubit is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. So the given ρ is (I)/2. So that would correspond to (I + 0)/2, right? Because if I set r to zero, then r·σ is zero, so the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2.

So the vector r in this case must be (0,0,0), because the Bloch vector is zero. That would place the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense for a maximally mixed state. Because for a completely mixed state, the Bloch vector is zero, so it's at the center, equidistant from all points on the sphere.

Wait, why is that
