Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work out by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle those infinities.

Let me look at the options:

A) Superstring Theory
B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
D) Classical Electrodynamics

Wait, what do I know about each of these theories and regularization?

Starting with QED, I remember that it's a quantum field theory and it does require renormalization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergent integrals. So you need to regularize them, maybe using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So QED does require regularization. That would mean option C is not the correct answer.

What about QCD? QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It also is a quantum field theory, so it should have similar issues with divergences. However, I think QCD is asymptotically free, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. But does that mean it doesn't need regularization? No, I think regularization is still needed because of the divergences in perturbative calculations. So B probably isn't the answer either.

Moving on to Classical Electrodynamics (D). Classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones when it comes to divergences because they don't involve the same kind of calculations. In classical E&M, you might have things like infinite charge densities at point charges, but those are handled a bit differently, perhaps with distributions or other mathematical constructs. But I'm not sure if regularization is a concept that applies to classical theories. Since regularization is a quantum field theory technique, maybe classical theories don't require it. So D could be the correct answer.

What about Superstring Theory (A)? I know string theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. It's a theory of quantum gravity. In string theory, the basic objects are strings rather than point particles. I think that string theories are free from some of the divergences that plague quantum field theories because the stringy nature of particles might change how loop divergences occur. For example, in superstring theory, which incorporates supersymmetry, the theory is finite? Or does it still need regularization? Wait, I think superstring theory doesn't require the same kind of renormalization as QED or QCD because the perturbation series might be finite or have better behavior. Or perhaps because of the way the theory is constructed, divergences are handled differently. So maybe A is a candidate.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Do superstring theories require regularization? I think they might not because the theory is background-dependent in some way or because of the higher-dimensional nature. Or perhaps because the string theory's perturbative expansion doesn't have the same divergent loops as in QFT. I might need to think deeper.

But wait, regularization is a way to deal with infinities in loop integrals. In string
