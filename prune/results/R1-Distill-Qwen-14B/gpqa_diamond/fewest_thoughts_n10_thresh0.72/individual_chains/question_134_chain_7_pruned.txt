Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The options are given as A to D. I'm a bit confused because usually, neutralization involves an acid and a base reacting. But here, there are three solutions. Oh wait, maybe some of them will react with each other.

First, I should probably figure out what reactions are happening when these are mixed. So, let's list the components:

1. 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl. So HCl is a strong acid, right? It dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

2. 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4. H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid. But wait, does it dissociate completely? I think the first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ per molecule. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

3. 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions, since Ba(OH)2 is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻.

So when these are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. But wait, H2
