Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let's see. The question gives me a lot of data about the star and the two planets. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both have the same albedo, so I don't have to worry about that factor varying between them. That should simplify things a bit.

First, the star's parameters: mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff is 6300 K. But wait, I think the key for equilibrium temperature is the star's luminosity because the temperature of the planet depends on how much starlight it receives. The luminosity comes from the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? Luminosity L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So I can compute the star's luminosity compared to the Sun's.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. But for equilibrium temperature, the mass and radius of the planet don't matter directly, I think. It's more about the distance from the star. Because the Doppler shift data relates to the velocity, which depends on the distance.

Wait, the RV method gives the mass of the planet, but here they've already given the masses. The transit method gives the radius. But the RV shifts are given for each planet. Oh, right, the RV shift tells us about the planet's mass and its distance. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is that the RV shift (in velocity) is related to the mass of the planet, the period, and the distance. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the problem says that both planets induce a shift in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively. The shift is a Doppler shift, so I think it's proportional to the velocity of the star. The Doppler shift
