Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model. So whatever symmetries the SM respects, SMEFT must respect as well, because it's an extension, not a violation.

Wait, the Standard Model has certain symmetries. Let me list them. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, that's for sure. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all reference frames moving at constant speed relative to each other. So SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So it's a broader symmetry. But wait, SMEFT can include operators that break Poincare symmetry? Hmm, no, wait. Because Poincare symmetry includes momentum translation. If the theory respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Or do the operators in SMEFT have to be Poincare invariant?

Wait, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be Lorentz invariant, but do they have to be Poincare invariant too?
