Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. The options are A to D, with the numbers 5,3,2,4. Hmm.

Let me start by recalling what optical activity means. A compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, it won't be chiral, so it won't be optically active. So each compound needs to be assessed for chirality.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double-bonded to the second carbon. The second carbon has a methyl group and two other substituents. Let me draw this.

The molecule is CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon (which is double bonded to the second carbon). The structure is Cl-C double bond, and the second carbon has a methyl and another CH2 group. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-? Hmm, maybe I should think about the double bond.

Wait, but the configuration is Z. So the groups on either side of the double bond are arranged. For but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, and on C2, a methyl group (from 2-methyl) and other substituents. But does this compound have any chiral centers?

Looking at each carbon. The first carbon is C-Cl, double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl and another group. Wait, the first carbon is CH2Cl? No, wait the first carbon is attached to Cl, double bond, and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of but-1-ene as CH2=CHCH2CH3. But with substituents on C1 and C2.

Wait, 1-ch
