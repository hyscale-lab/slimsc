Okay, so I've got this question about which organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism, right. That's when compounds have chiral centers, making them non-superimposable mirror images. So the question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones can show optical isomerism.

Let me look at each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls with substituents on the rings. Wait, so biphenyls can have different substituents, but for optical isomerism, there needs to be a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's about hindered rotation causing the two phenyl rings to be in different positions, leading to enantiomers. Oh, wait, biphenyl groups can have something called diastereomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral. But wait, biphenyls themselves are symmetrical if the substituents are in positions that don't create a chiral center. Hmm, in this case, the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, each phenyl ring has two substituents? Let me think. So each ring has a nitro group at 6' and a carboxylate at 2. So the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 2', and 6 and 6'. Oh, wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

Wait, but biphenyls can have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are arranged symmetrically. If the substituents on one ring mirror the other, the molecule might be achiral. But in this case, each ring has the same substituents at the same positions, so maybe it's symmetric. So the molecule could be a meso compound or have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism?

Wait, no, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that causes the biphenyl to be chiral. Wait, the biphenyl group itself can't have a chiral center because phenyl rings are flat. But if
