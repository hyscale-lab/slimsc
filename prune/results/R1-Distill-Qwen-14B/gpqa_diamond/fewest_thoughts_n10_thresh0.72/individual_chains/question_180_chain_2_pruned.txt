Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. What's the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals?

Hmm, I think this is about electric potential energy since we're dealing with charges and energy. Since all the charges are the same, this should involve calculating the potential energy between each pair of charges.

Wait, so the system has 13 charges. One is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is 2m from P, but what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all fixed at the same point 2m from P, but maybe arranged in a circle or something? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m, but it doesn't say anything about their arrangement. So I think we can assume they're all at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. Oh wait, the problem says "12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2m from a point P." So maybe they're all at a sphere of radius 2m around P, but their exact positions relative to each other aren't fixed. Hmm, but if they're all the same distance from P, but their mutual distances vary, does that affect the potential energy calculation? Or perhaps, since they're identical and non-moving except for their mutual interactions, maybe the potential energy only depends on their positions relative to each other?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The system's energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So for each pair of charges, we calculate the potential energy and sum them all.

But, in this setup, we have 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2m from P. So each of the 12 is 2m away from the 13th charge. But what about the distance between each of the 12 charges themselves? Are they all 2m from each other as well? Or are
