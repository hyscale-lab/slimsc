Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The problem starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting patterns can tell us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, so maybe a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, the triplet is for 6H, so maybe that's two sets of CH2 groups? Or perhaps it's a larger group. Like, maybe a (CH3)2CH structure? No, wait, (CH3)2CH would have a triplet for the CH, but that's only 3H. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted group. Let me think: two separate CH3 groups attached to a CH2. That would give each CH3 a triplet because each is next to the CH2. So for each CH3, the triplet is due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. If there are two CH3 groups, each with 3H, that would account for 6H as a triplet. So maybe the structure is something like (CH3)2CHCH2... but wait, the other signal is a quartet (4H) at 1.3 ppm. Quartet means coupling with three neighboring H's, so maybe each of those four H's is adjacent to a CH3 group? Or perhaps a CH2 next to a CH2. Let me think: if the quartet is for four H's, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group where the central CH2 is between two CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is due to a CH2 group next to a CH3. Let me think about the integration: 6H as triplet and 4H as quartet. That makes a total of 10 H's. Wait, but the compound is undergoing monobromination, so it must have a bromine in compound B.

Wait, what about looking for a structure where there are two sets of equivalent protons. For
