Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. We're given Φ0 as π/4 and U0 as 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, wait, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The main difference is that cyclotrons use dees (the D-shaped boxes) to accelerate particles with a constant magnetic field, while synchrocyclotrons vary the magnetic field over time to keep the particles in sync with the accelerating voltage. So the magnetic field increases as the particles gain energy.

In a cyclotron, the time for one revolution is the same as the period of the oscillator because the magnetic field is constant. But in a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field isn't constant, the frequency changes, so the revolution time changes too. Oh right, the frequency ν actually increases as the particles gain energy because the cyclotron frequency depends on the magnetic field and the particle's mass and charge.

Wait, the formula for cyclotron frequency is ω = (qB)/(m), right? But since in a synchrocyclotron, B increases, the frequency ν would increase as the proton gains energy.

But I'm not exactly sure about the formulas here. Let me think. The key might be to find the number of revolutions the proton makes while it's being accelerated. Since the proton starts from rest and gains energy in steps, each time it goes through a half-cycle of the voltage, it gains a certain amount of energy.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the particles go through the accelerating gaps multiple times, each time being accelerated when the voltage is in the correct phase. So each time the proton goes through a region where the voltage is applied, it gains some energy.

Let me try to remember the energy gain per revolution. In each full cycle (like a full oscillation period) of the voltage, the particle is accelerated
