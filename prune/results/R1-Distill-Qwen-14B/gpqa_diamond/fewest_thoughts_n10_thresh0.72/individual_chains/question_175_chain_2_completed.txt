Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that oscillating charges can radiate energy, and this radiation has certain properties depending on the setup.

The question says it's a spheroid charge distribution oscillating, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. So I'm picturing like an ellipsoid shape, right? And because it's oscillating, it'll radiate at a certain wavelength, lambda.

The problem is asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

Wait, I think the radiated power depends on the angle theta. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is typically a function of theta. Like, a dipole's radiation pattern is maximum perpendicular to the dipole axis, so maybe at 90 degrees, and minimum along the axis (0 and 180 degrees).

But wait, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal. Oh, wait, I think in the case of a dipole, the radiation is maximum at theta=90 degrees, and falls off as theta approaches 0 or 180. But for a quadrupole or higher multipoles, the pattern might be different.

Wait, the problem is about an oscillating charge distribution in a spheroid shape. So perhaps it's a dipole? Or maybe a higher-order multipole? Hmm.

Wait, no, dipole radiation has a certain pattern. Let me think: the radiation pattern for an oscillating dipole is given by the formula P proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)) or something like that. Wait, I think it's (some function) of cos(theta). Wait, let me recall. The power radiated by a dipole in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to ( (d^2 p)/(dt^2 ) )^2 multiplied by (1/(r^5)) and (1 + cos²(theta)).

Wait, the electric field of a dipole in the far field has components that depend on cos(theta). So the power, which is the square of the electric field times some constants, would have a term like (1 + cos^2(theta)).

So for a dipole, the radiation pattern peaks at theta = 90 degrees, because that's where cos(theta) is zero, but (1 + 0) gives 1. Wait, no wait, wait. Wait, no, wait: Let me think again. The formula for the electric field is something like E proportional to (p''(t) / r) * (1/(4πε0 c²)) * sin(theta) e^{i(kr - ωt)} or something like that.

Wait, but when you square that for the Poynting vector (which gives the power), you end up with terms involving sin^2(theta) and other terms. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at theta = 90 degrees, and it's zero along the axis (theta=0 or 180). No, wait, that's not right. Because I think the dipole's radiation has maximum at 90 degrees, then it varies with cos(theta). Hmm. Alternatively, for a dipole, the radiation intensity (which is the power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (2/3) (d^2 p/dt^2)^2 (1/(c^6 r^5)) (1 + cos^2 theta). So the intensity peaks at theta=90 degrees.

Wait, so the function f(theta) would be proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)). So the maximum intensity is when theta=90 degrees, where cos(theta)=0, so 1 + 0 = 1. At theta=0, cos(theta)=1, so 1 + 1= 2. Wait, that would mean maximum at 0 degrees? Wait, that can't be right because I thought dipole radiation is maximum at 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Another way: the intensity pattern for a dipole is symmetric and has a maximum at 90 degrees. So maybe the formula is (3/4) (1 - cos^2 theta), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (1 + cos²(theta)).

Wait, let me think again. The dipole's radiation pattern is such that the intensity is maximum at theta=90 degrees. So when theta=90 degrees, cos(theta)=0, so the term (1 + cos²(theta)) is 1, but when theta approaches 0, cos(theta)=1, so (1 + 1)=2, which would imply higher intensity along the axis, which contradicts what I thought earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me see. The general form for the radiation from a dipole is that the electric field E is proportional to (p''(t) / r) * sin(theta) e^{i(kr - wt)}, and the magnetic field H is proportional to (p''(t)/r) * (1/c) cos(theta) e^{i(kr - wt)}.

Wait, but when I calculate the Poynting vector (E × H), it should give the power per unit area. So E is proportional to sin(theta), H to cos(theta), so E × H would involve sin(theta) * cos(theta). Then the intensity (which is the time-averaged Poynting vector) would be proportional to sin(theta) cos(theta). But wait, that would make the intensity maximum at theta=45 degrees, which isn't right. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression for the intensity is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)), which would be maximum at theta=0 and 180 degrees (cos(theta)=±1), which is exactly opposite to what I thought earlier about dipole radiation.

Wait, that can't be right because I know that a dipole's radiation pattern is maximum perpendicular to the axis, not along. So perhaps I'm mixing up the formula.

Wait, maybe I should think about the radiation from a dipole. The dipole moment oscillates along the z-axis. The far field (radiation) fields are given by E and B fields that depend on theta. The maximum radiation occurs when the angle is 90 degrees from the dipole axis because that's where the fields are strongest.

Wait, perhaps the intensity is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)), meaning maximum at theta=0 and 180, but that can't be. That would imply that the maximum radiation is along the axis, which I thought was the case for a monopole, but dipoles are different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (1 - cos^2(theta)), which would peak at theta=90 degrees. Because (1 - cos^2(theta)) = sin^2(theta), which peaks at 90 degrees.

Wait, but if the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta), then yes, it's zero at theta=0 and 180, and maximum at 90. That's the dipole radiation pattern I remember.

So that would mean that the function f(theta) is proportional to sin^2(theta) or (1 - cos^2(theta)).

Wait, but the problem says that the function is f(lambda and theta), so I need to include the dependence on lambda as well.

Wait, the question is about the form of f, which is the power per unit solid angle. So f would be a function of lambda and theta.

Now, I think that the radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) for a dipole is proportional to (1/(lambda^4)) multiplied by (1 - cos^2(theta)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the intensity is proportional to (1/(lambda^something)) times the angular dependence.

Wait, let's think about the dependence on lambda. The radiation from an oscillating dipole has a certain wavelength, lambda, which is related to the oscillation frequency. The radiated power depends on the acceleration (second derivative of dipole moment), and other factors. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) would have a dependence on 1/lambda^4, because the fields fall off as 1/r, and the power (which is E^2 times r^2 in some sense) would involve 1/r^5. But wait, in the problem, the function f is given per unit solid angle, so perhaps the 1/r^5 dependence is already accounted for in the radiation zone.

Alternatively, let me try to recall the formula for the intensity from a dipole radiator.

The intensity (I) is given by ( ( (μ0 με0) / (4π) ) * ( (ω^4) * |p''|^2 ) ) * ( (1/(c^4 r^5)) ) * (1 + cos²θ), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe it's ( (ω^4 |p''|^2 )/(6 c^5 r^5) ) * (1 + cos²θ), which would mean that as lambda decreases (since lambda = 2π c / ω ), the intensity would increase, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the function f is given as a function of lambda and theta. So the key is to find how f depends on lambda and theta.

Wait, thinking about the dependence on lambda. The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (ω^4) (since p'' is proportional to ω²), so if the system is oscillating at a frequency f, then ω = 2πf. So the intensity would depend on ω^4, which is (2πf)^4. But since lambda = c / f, f = c / lambda. So substituting, ω^4 = (2π c / lambda )^4. So the intensity would have a factor of (1/lambda^4), because (c^4 / lambda^4). So the intensity would be proportional to 1/lambda^4, multiplied by the angular dependence.

Wait, but wait: In the formula for the intensity, I think it's proportional to (ω^4) × (1/r^5) × (1 + cos^2(theta)). So for the same dipole, as r increases, the intensity decreases as 1/r^5. But the problem states that this is in the radiation zone, so r is large, but the function f is per unit solid angle. So the angular part would be (1 + cos^2(theta)), and the lambda dependence would be (omega^4) = (2pi f)^4 = (2pi c/(lambda))^4 = (c^4)/(lambda^4) * (2pi)^4.

So the intensity (per unit solid angle) would be proportional to (1/lambda^4) × (1 + cos^2(theta)), assuming the other factors are considered constants for this problem.

Wait, but the problem says the function f is a function of lambda and theta. So the function is f(theta) * 1/lambda^4, perhaps.

So the angular part of the intensity is (1 + cos^2(theta)), so the function f would be proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) / lambda^4.

Wait, but the question is asking for the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta=30 degrees.

So, the maximum intensity occurs where (1 + cos^2(theta)) is maximum. Let me compute what's the maximum of (1 + cos^2(theta)).

The term (1 + cos²(theta)) reaches maximum when cos(theta) is maximum, which is at theta=0, where cos(theta)=1, so 1+1=2. Alternatively, wait, but wait, I thought dipole radiation is maximum at theta=90, but according to this function, it's maximum at 0 and 180. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait a second, perhaps I got the angular dependence wrong. Let me think again. Maybe for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at 90 degrees, and the function is (sin^2(theta)), not (1 + cos^2(theta)).

Wait, let me think about the actual radiation pattern. For a dipole antenna, the intensity pattern is maximum at 90 degrees, and it's symmetric about the equatorial plane. The intensity is proportional to sin²(theta), which peaks at theta=90 degrees.

So, the function for the intensity would be proportional to sin²(theta), which is (1 - cos^2(theta)).

So, substituting theta=30 degrees, cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So cos^2(theta)=3/4. So sin^2(theta)=1 - 3/4 = 1/4.

So the intensity at theta=30 degrees would be (1/4) times the maximum intensity, which occurs at theta=90 degrees (sin^2(theta)=1, so f=1, maximum).

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum power is A. So the fraction of A at theta=30 degrees would be (1/4) A? But wait, in that case, the fraction would be 1/4.

Wait, but the problem says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta=30 degrees." So if the maximum is A, and the intensity at 30 is (1/4) of the maximum, then the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure: the function f(theta) is the intensity per unit solid angle. So the total power is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. But the maximum occurs at theta=90, where f(theta)=1, for example.

So the fraction would be f(theta=30) / f(theta=90) = (1/4) / 1 = 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but the options given are:

Option C) 1/4, lambda^(-4)
Option B) 1/4, lambda^(-3)
So the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is either lambda^-3 or lambda^-4.

Earlier, I thought the form of f is 1/lambda^4, because the intensity is proportional to (1/lambda^4) * (1 - cos^2(theta)).

Wait, but let me think again about the dependence on lambda. The intensity is proportional to (omega^4) / (lambda^4), because omega = 2pi c / lambda. So omega^4 = (2pi)^4 c^4 / lambda^4. So the intensity scales as 1/lambda^4.

So the function f should have a form like (1/lambda^4) times the angular part, which is (1 - cos^2(theta)).

So, the function f would be proportional to (1 - cos^2(theta)) / lambda^4.

Therefore, the form of f is lambda^-4 multiplied by an angular function.

So in the options, the function f is given, and the options for the form are lambda^(-4), lambda^(-3), etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1/2, λ^(-4) → fraction is 1/2, form λ^-4

Option B)1/4, λ^(-3)

Option C) 1/4, λ^(-4)

Option D)3/4, λ^(-6)

So according to our earlier analysis, the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^-4, which is option C.

So the answer would be option C: the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is λ^(-4).


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( \theta \) is the angle with respect to the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the functional form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   For a dipole radiator, the intensity pattern is proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \), which peaks at \( \theta = 90^\circ \) and is zero along the axis (\( \theta = 0^\circ \) and \( \theta = 180^\circ \)). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 1/4 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength \( \lambda \)**:  
   The intensity is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega = 2\pi f \) is the angular frequency. Since \( \lambda = \frac{c}{f} \), substituting \( f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \) gives \( \omega^4 \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \). Therefore, the intensity scales as \( \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \).

3. **Function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \)**:  
   Combining the angular dependence \( \sin^2(\theta) \) and the wavelength dependence \( \frac{1}{\lambda^4} \), the function \( f \) takes the form \( f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\lambda^4} \).

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   - Option A: \( \frac{1}{2}, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).  
   - Option B: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the wavelength dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).  
   - Option C: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as both the fraction and the wavelength dependence match.  
   - Option D: \( \frac{3}{4}, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), and the wavelength dependence is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the function \( f \) has the form \( \lambda^{-4} \).

**Answer: C**
