Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. 

Wait, so I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like distance = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is the velocity over c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, how do I get tau? Oh, right, the proper lifetime is related to the width. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think Γ is given in MeV, and I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me jot down the equations.

First, calculate the mean lifetime tau. 

Tau = hbar / Gamma.

But Gamma is given in MeV, and I know that hbar c is a convenient unit. Wait, let me recall the natural units. In particle physics, people often use units where ħ = c = 1, but when calculating physical quantities like distance or time, I need to convert using ħ and c.

Wait, ħ (hbar) is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Hmm, so since Gamma is given in MeV, I should convert it to GeV.

Gamma_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Gamma_X = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait, but I'm not sure if I remember the exact value of ħ in GeV·s. Let me double-check that. Oh right, ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So yeah, that calculation is correct.

Next, I need to find the Lorentz factor gamma.
