Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, which are different symmetry groups. I remember that symmetry groups relate to the shapes of molecules, like whether they have certain planes of symmetry or axes.

So, let's break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, 8 equivalents suggests a ratio of 8:1 for A to B. Wait, no, because A is solid and B is gas. So the products would be in the ratio of the reactants. Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen or something. But I'm not sure yet.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. I'm trying to think about what C could be. Maybe C is a compound formed from the first reaction, and reacting it with D gives E. If E is dangerous, perhaps it's something like a nerve agent or a toxic gas, but that's probably beyond the point. Let's think about the other clues.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into A plus these two acids. Since F is a strong acid, like HCl, and G is a weak acid, like CH3COOH. So perhaps C is a salt that, when water is added, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, but how? Maybe C is something like a metal chloride with another component. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide, but that's not likely because adding water would give H2S, which is a weak acid. Or perhaps C has two different acid components in it. Wait, another thought: If C is a nitrate or sulfate, but when it reacts with water, maybe it forms the metal hydroxide and some acid. Hmm, not sure yet.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B in a 1:1 ratio make H, which is a solvent. Common solvents are like water (but B would be something else), ethanol, acetone, etc. If B is a gas, maybe it's a halogen. Wait, D reacting with B in 1:1... Let's think about it. If B is Cl2, and D is maybe O2, but that wouldn't make a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is something else. Wait, another angle: If H is a solvent like HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent), or perhaps H is something like NH3, but I don't know. Wait, another thought: D and B form H, which is a solvent. If B is Cl2 and D is something else... Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but H would be H2O, which is a solvent. Oh, wait, that makes
