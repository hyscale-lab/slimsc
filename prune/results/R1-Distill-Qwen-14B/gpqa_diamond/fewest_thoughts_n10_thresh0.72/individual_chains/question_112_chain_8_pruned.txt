Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the Pauli z matrix. So, I should probably write down what |alpha> looks like.

First, I need to normalize the state because it's given as proportional. So, the state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>, where a is the normalization constant. To find a, I calculate the norm of the state.

The norm squared is |a|^2 times the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient. So, for the first coefficient (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For the second coefficient (2-i), the magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So, the total norm squared is a^2*(2 +5) =7a^2. To normalize, a^2 must be 1/7, so a is 1/sqrt(7). So, the state becomes:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the next part is about an operator whose matrix representation has elements A_ij. The operator A is defined such that A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. The matrix has zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So, for a 2x2 matrix, it would look like:

[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Because for i≠j, it's ħ/2, and on the diagonal (i=j), it's 0.

Hmm, this matrix looks familiar. I think it's proportional to the Pauli x matrix. The Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this A matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli x matrix. So, operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

The problem asks for two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A, and the average value of that operator.

Wait, but wait. The eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x because A is just a multiple of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? So, the eigenstates of A are the same. Let me confirm that.

The eigenstates of σ_x are indeed those. So, the eigenstates of A would be the same. So, the first eigenstate is |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and the second is |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

But wait, the question is phrased as "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A". So, I think we're to find the probability that when we measure A, we get each eigenvalue. Since A is a Hermitian operator, its eigenvalues are real, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes in each eigenstate.

So, the approach is to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation values and the probabilities using the matrix elements. Let me think which is easier.

But maybe it's easier to diagonalize A. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x
