Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So, structure-wise, it's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group.

First reaction: treated with bromine, forming product 1. Bromine is Br2. I'm trying to recall what reactions Br2 does with ketones. Oh, wait, ketones can undergo several reactions. Bromine could be adding across the double bond if it were unsaturated, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh right! In the presence of a base, like maybe some aqueous conditions, bromine can add to the carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxidation, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, wait, another thought: maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but that's for dienes and dienophiles. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible reactions of ketones with Br2.

Wait, another possibility: the enol formation. But wait, cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens because the carbonyl is at position 1, and the adjacent carbons (position 2) have hydrogens. So, under certain conditions, Br2 can add across the carbonyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrination. Oh wait, bromohydrination is when a bromine and a hydroxyl group add across a double bond, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Hmm.

Wait
