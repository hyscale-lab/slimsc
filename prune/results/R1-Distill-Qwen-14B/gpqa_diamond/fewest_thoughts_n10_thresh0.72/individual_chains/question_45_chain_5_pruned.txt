Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, four identical particles... Oh wait, since they are spin-1/2, they are fermions, right? So that means they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Which says that no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, the potential well has length L. Each particle is in this well, so each has its own quantum state. The energy levels in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²). Oh wait, and the problem defines E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²). So E_n = n² E. That's a good point. So each state's energy is just E multiplied by the square of its quantum number.

Since the particles are identical fermions, they must follow the Pauli exclusion principle. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D box, what are the quantum numbers? Each particle has a principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). But since the particles are spin-1/2, their spin can be either up or down. So for each n, there are two possible states (spin up and spin down). Oh, wait, but wait. In a one-dimensional box, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n, because there are no angular momentum quantum numbers (like l and m_l), since it's a box, not a hydrogen atom. So, each state is defined by n and spin.

So for each n, there are two possible fermions: one with spin up and another with spin down. But since we're dealing with four particles, which are identical fermions, we need to fill up the states following the Pauli principle.

Let me think about how the energy levels fill up. The ground state (lowest energy) would have the lowest possible n's, filled with as many particles as possible.

So starting from n=1: each n
