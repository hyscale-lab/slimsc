Okay, so I've got this problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for each particle is given by E_n = (n² * π² * ħ²) / (2mL²), right? And the problem simplifies that to E multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, the problem states E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each individual energy level is just E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, so no two can occupy the same quantum state. So each state is defined by their quantum numbers and spin. In a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and spin. Since they are spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states: up or down.

So for each energy level n, there are two possible spin states. But since we have four particles, we need to fill these states according to the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think, the ground state would be the lowest energy. Each n can have two particles because of spin. So for n=1, we can have two particles (each with opposite spin). Then n=2 can take two more, right? So ground state would have two particles at n=1 and two at n=2. Wait, but wait, n can't be the same for all four. Wait, no, wait each particle is in a different state. So for four particles, we need to fill the lowest available n levels with their respective spin states.

Wait, maybe I should think of the ground state as the lowest possible arrangement. Let's count the particles.

Each n level can hold two particles (since spin up and down). So for four particles:

n=1 can hold 2 particles.

n=2 can hold 2 particles.

So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 (each with opposite spin) and two in n=2 (opposite spins again).

So each particle's energy would be E for n=1, 4E for n=2. Wait, no. Wait, E_n is n²E. So for n=1, each has E, and n=2 has (2²)E=4E.

Wait, but the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. So two particles at n=1 (each E) gives 2E. Two particles at n=2 (each 4E) gives 8E. So total ground state energy is 2E +8E=10E? Wait, no, wait. No, wait, each particle's energy is n² E, so each particle in n=1 contributes E, each in n=2 contributes 4E. So two particles at n=1: 2 * E = 2E. Two at n=2: 2 *4E=8E. Together, 2E+8E=10E.

Wait, but the question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. So the ground state energy is 10E? Hmm, looking at the options, option B and C have 10E as a middle number. Let me see.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ground state isn't necessarily 10E. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the possible states. Each particle is a fermion, so each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. But in a 1D box, the state is just determined by n and spin. So each n can hold two particles.

So with four particles, the first two go into n=1 with opposite spins. The next two go into n=2 with opposite spins. So the system energy is (2 particles * E) + (2 particles *4E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Because I thought the ground state would have the lowest possible energy, which would have the particles in the lowest possible orbitals. But wait, in the case of four particles, maybe some can go into higher orbitals but with different spins. Hmm, no, because each n can take two particles. So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2 is the way to go.
