Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation. Oh right, that's from Einstein's theory of relativity. I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of an outside observer, but the astronaut on the ship would experience less time because of something called time dilation.

So the problem says that there are aliens from the Large Magellanic Cloud with a spacecraft going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years, which is 150 years. But the astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective.

Wait, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, right? So we need to calculate the proper time they experience during the journey.

First, let's think about the distance. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and it's about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance D is roughly 163,000 light-years. But wait, the problem doesn't give specific distances, so maybe the actual distance isn't crucial here, because the main point is the time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention the distance. Oh wait, wait the problem says the destination is Earth, so the distance is the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Let me think, is that given? Or is it supposed to be calculated?

Wait, the problem statement doesn't provide the distance, but the options are about the time experienced by the astronaut. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to use the given speed and some standard distance, but perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about time dilation and not the actual time taken. Let's see. The spacecraft is going at 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. So the gamma factor (Lorentz factor) would
