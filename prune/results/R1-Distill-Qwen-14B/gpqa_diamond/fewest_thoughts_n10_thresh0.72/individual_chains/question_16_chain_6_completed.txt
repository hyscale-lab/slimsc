Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means that a compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That's due to having chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry in the molecule.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait. The but-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, no, the compound is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so substituting. So, wait, 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe the double bond is between 1 and 2. Wait, but the formula is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that would be (Z)-configuration. So does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's see. The molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2Cl attached to CH(CH3) with a double bond to CH2. Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, but if the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, then the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's butane. Oh wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, a methyl on C2, and the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but the but-1-ene is four carbons in a row, so maybe it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 which has a methyl group, then C3 and C4.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The formula is but-1-ene, so four carbons with double bond starting at C1. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. So the structure would be: C1=C2-CH2-CH3. But with substituents. 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl a methyl on C2.

Wait, so the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that doesn't seem right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So substituting Cl on C1, and methyl on C2, the formula would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But wait, that's not a double bond. Oh wait, wait! The compound is but-1-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace a H on C1 with Cl. And 2-methyl would add a methyl group on C2.

So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, because that would imply a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, perhaps the structure is CHCl2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, no, wait. Maybe I'm getting confused. But regardless, the main point is whether this compound has a chiral center.

In this molecule, each carbon: C1 has Cl, C2 has a methyl, etc. But for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. So let's see:

If the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, then C2 is connected to C1 (Cl, CH2), C3 (CH2?), and a methyl group. Also, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C1 is double-bonded to C2.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be right because that's a single bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that's three carbons, but but-1-ene is four. Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the structure, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which is Cl attached to C1, a methyl on C2, and the double bond between C1 and C2. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, that's four carbons. So C1: Cl, C2: CH(CH3), C3: CH2, C4: CH3? Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding 1-chloro would replace H on C1 with Cl, so CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3, but that's single bonds. Wait, no, because it's but-1-ene, so double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not correct for but-1-ene with a double bond. Maybe I'm getting this wrong, but perhaps the point is, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Wait, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 has Cl, and C2 has a methyl. But in a double bond, each carbon can only have two substituents (as the double bond takes two bonds). So, for C1: attached to Cl, a double bond to C2, and two more bonds? Wait, no: in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms. So in CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, is that possible? Wait, if it's but-1-ene, four carbons, so for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure would be:

Cl
|
CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2 ?

Wait, that makes no sense. Maybe I should think of it as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that's four carbons. So, C1: Cl and CH2, C2: CH(CH3), double bond, C3: CH2, C4: CH3? Hmm, perhaps not. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can think about whether this molecule has a chiral center.

Wait, if the molecule has a double bond, can that contribute to chirality? No, because double bonds are planar. So any chiral centers would have to be in the carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a stereogenic center. Let's see: looking at the substituents on each carbon. If the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's without a double bond. Wait, but with a double bond, maybe the substituents are different.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is double bonded to another CH2. But regardless, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the substituents aren't four different groups on any carbon.

Wait, for example, C2 in this structure: if it's connected to Cl (from C1), a double bond (so only two substituents?), a methyl group, and maybe another CH group. Wait, no, because in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two groups. So perhaps C1 is bonded to Cl, two H's (if it's CH2Cl), and double bonded to C2. Then C2 is bonded to CH(CH3), a double bond to C1, and another CH2 group. So, in that case, for C2, substituents are CH(CH3), CH2CH2..., and two from the double bond. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe this molecule is not chiral. Maybe it's planar or has a plane of symmetry. Or perhaps the substituents on the double bond are such that it's a geometric isomer but not a chiral center. So, the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, may not be chiral because even though it's a Z isomer, it doesn't have a chiral center. So, no optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a double bond and some substituents that could lead to a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on either side of the double bond are mirror images, then the molecule could be meso or have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because of the substituents around the double bond. No, wait, double bonds themselves don't create chiral centers. Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups. So, perhaps the first compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Moving on to the second compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

Hmm, this looks complex. Let me try to parse the name. Methanoisobenzofuran would be a ring structure. Hexahydro suggests six-membered ring, maybe with some hydrogenation. The substituents include chloromethylene and an E configuration.

Wait, the substituent is chloromethylene, which is Cl-C=, so perhaps attached to the ring. The (E) configuration indicates that the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides.

Now, whether this compound has a chiral center depends on the structure. The substituents could create asymmetry. The molecule has specific R and S designations at 3a and 7a, which are stereocenters. So, with those stereocenters, the molecule is chiral. So, this compound would have optical activity.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, 2,3-dimethyl would have methyl groups on C2 and C3. The configuration is R and S respectively.

So, each of those carbons (C2 and C3) are connected to four different groups?

Wait, C2: connected to two CH2 groups (C1 and C3), a methyl, and the carboxylic acid group on either side. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, the structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH.

So, 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)H-COOH. Wait, but each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of the CH2 groups (C2 and C3) in succinic acid becomes CH(CH3) groups.

So, each of those carbons (C2 and C3) has:

C2: connected to two CH(CH3) groups (no, wait, C2 is connected to C1 (which is COOH, but wait no, C1 is the first carbon in the chain. Wait, I think the succinic acid is four carbons: 1,2,3,4. So, the structure is:

1: COOH
2: CH2 (becomes CH(CH3))
3: CH2 (becomes CH(CH3))
4: COOH

Wait, so for (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the C2 and C3 has a methyl group.

Wait, but each of those carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (from C3), and another group. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: two CH(CH3) groups, a COOH group on one side, and a CH(CH3) on the other. Hmm, but wait, each carbon in the chain is connected to two adjacent carbons, so C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups.

Wait, no. For C2, the groups are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (on C3), two methyl groups? No, wait, no. Each CH(CH3) is a carbon attached to one methyl group. So, each of these middle carbons has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the C2 and C3 have four different groups. Let's try:

C2: connected to C1 (which is COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), a methyl group, and another substituent.

Wait, for C2:

- One substituent is the COOH from C1 (so that's a carbonyl group maybe? No, in succinic acid, it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you have 2 and 3 as CH(CH3), each CH(CH3) is connected to the adjacent carbons.

So, C2 is attached to:

- C1: which is a COOH group.

- C3: which is another CH(CH3).

- A methyl group.

- And another hydrogen? Because in CH2, it's CH2, but when you add a methyl, it's CH(CH3). But wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for C2 (the middle carbons), each has:

- One COOH group on one side.

- The other side is the adjacent CH(CH3) (C3).

- And two substituents: one methyl and one hydrogen? No, wait, wait. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So for each of the middle carbons, they're each connected to:

- Two methyl groups (from their own CH(CH3)).

- The adjacent carbons (C1 and C3).

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3), so each has:

- One methyl group.

- Two CH(CH3) groups (from adjacent carbons)? No, wait, C2 is attached to C1 and C3. So in the structure, C2 is connected to C1 (which is a CH2COOH?), but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the middle carbons has four different substituents. Let's see: for C2:

- One substituent is the COOH group (from C1).

- Another substituent is the adjacent C3 (which is CH(CH3)).

- Third substituent is a methyl group.

- Fourth substituent is a hydrogen? Because in a CH(CH3), the carbon has three substituents: two H and one CH3, plus the two from the chain.

Wait, no. For a CH(CH3) group, the carbon has:

- One CH3 group.

- Two CH2 (from the chain? No, wait, in this case, each CH(CH3) is part of the chain, so each has:

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure again.

The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- One COOH group (on C2: from C1; on C3: from C4? No, wait. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 and C3. So for C2, substituents are:

- C1: which is a COOH group attached to a CH2? No, wait, in succinic acid, it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. But with 2 and 3 methyl groups, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (COOH) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, so for C2:

- One substituent: COOH group (from C1).

- Another substituent: CH(CH3) (from C3).

- Third substituent: methyl group.

- Fourth substituent: a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would mean four different substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H. So that would make C2 a chiral center, right? Similarly, C3 would have substituents: CH(CH3) (from C2), COOH (from C4?), methyl, and H? Wait, but in this case, for C3, the substituents would be the same as C2, making it a chiral center as well.

But wait, the two stereocenters are R and S. So, this molecule has two chiral centers, leading to four stereoisomers, but because of the substituents, it's a meso compound or not?

Wait, if we have (2R,3S) configuration, is there a plane of symmetry?

The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, it's symmetric around the center. Because the substituents on C2 and C3 are mirror images of each other. So, if C2 is R and C3 is S, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound, so the molecule is not chiral overall.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. If the molecule is symmetric, then any stereocenters would be mirrored, leading to an internal plane of symmetry. So, if both (2R,3S) are present, and the molecule is symmetric, then it's a meso compound, and thus not chiral.

But wait, (2R,3S) would have the configurations R and S on adjacent carbons. But if the molecule is symmetric, maybe those configurations would cancel each other.

Let me imagine the structure. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, it's symmetrical around the center between C2 and C3. So, if C2 is R and C3 is S, looking at the mirror image across the center, perhaps they are mirror images of each other, making the molecule achiral. So, this would be a meso compound, so no optical activity.

Wait, but in that case, the molecule would not be chiral, so no optical activity. So, this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me think again. For a molecule to be meso, it must have multiple stereocenters and an internal plane of symmetry. In this case, the two stereocenters (C2 and C3) are in a symmetrical position. So, if the configurations are R and S, but the molecule is symmetrical, then the two stereocenters would mirror each other, making the molecule achiral.

So, for (2R,3S), would it be a meso form? For example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when it has (2R,3S) configuration because of the plane of symmetry. So yes, this compound is a meso compound, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait. If the configurations are R and S, but the substituents on the chiral centers are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is meso. So, the answer is that this compound is not chiral, so no optical activity.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.

So, same structure as the previous compound, but both stereocenters are R.

In this case, the molecule would have two R configurations on C2 and C3.

Because the molecule is symmetric, the configurations on C2 and C3 would be mirror images if the molecule is symmetric. Wait, but if both are R, that can't be symmetric. Because in the symmetric position, C2 and C3 would be mirror images, so their configurations would be opposite.

So, if both are R, the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So, this compound would have two chiral centers (both R) leading to a chiral molecule, so it would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with both C2 and C3 as R configuration.

If the molecule is not symmetrical because the substituents on C2 and C3 are not mirror images, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, if the configurations are the same (both R), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry? No, because in that case, the substituents on each chiral center would not mirror each other.

Wait, when you have two chiral centers in a symmetrical molecule, if their configurations are the same, it's possible that the molecule is not meso. Wait, no, for meso compounds, the stereocenters must be opposite in configuration but mirror images. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, the stereocenters are R and S, making it meso. So, in our case, if both are R, the molecule would not be symmetric, so it would be chiral.

So, the (2R,3R) configuration would result in a chiral molecule, leading to optical activity.

So, the fourth compound is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

Fifth compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.

Hmm, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The structure is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on carbon 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

So, the structure is a six-membered ring with one double bond (between C3 and C4) and an OH group on C1. The configuration is R.

Wait, but is this molecule chiral?

For a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents on C1 are arranged such that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

But in this case, the substituents on C1 would be: OH, and three other substituents (the adjacent carbons in the ring). Let me think about the structure.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, and the OH is on C1.

The configuration is R, which implies that the OH group is in a specific position relative to the other substituents.

Wait, but the ring's substituents might lead to a plane of symmetry. For example, if the OH is on C1, and the ring has a double bond, perhaps the substituents on either side of the ring are arranged symmetrically or not.

Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 would be connected to C2 and C6. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So, the substituents on C1 are: OH, the two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6), and the ring structure. Wait, but the ring itself is not flat—wait, no, rings can be either chair or boat conformations, but the point is, the molecule's structure.

Wait, perhaps C1 has four different substituents: OH, C2, C6, and another group. Or maybe not. Let me think about the substituents on C1.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond (C3-C4) and an OH on C1.

So, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH group.

- Two adjacent ring carbons (C2 and C6).

- And the ring structure (like, the bridge to C2 and C6).

But wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 would be: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and the bridge. Wait, but if the ring is in a chair conformation, the substituents could be axial or equatorial. But regardless, the point is whether C1 has four different substituents.

Wait, for C1:

- The groups attached would be:

1. OH group.

2. C2, which is connected to C1 and C3 (double bond to C4).

3. C6, which is connected to C1 and C5.

4. And the ring structure, which is the bridge between C1 and C6.

Wait, perhaps each of these substituents is different. If so, then C1 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral.

So, in this case, (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has an R configuration at C1, indicating a chiral center, so the molecule is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

Sixth compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

So, a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration.

Wait, this would create a molecule where each OH is in the same configuration (s), but the question is whether the molecule is chiral.

But wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all OH groups in the same configuration. Let's imagine the structure.

In a cyclohexane ring, positions 1, 3, 5 are alternate positions, forming an equilateral triangle on the ring. So, the OH groups are at every other carbon.

If all OH groups are in the same stereochemistry (all s), perhaps there's a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making the molecule achiral.

Alternatively, the arrangement could lead to a chiral molecule.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. If all three OH groups are on the same face of the ring, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry.

But wait, in the (1s,3s,5s) configuration, it's possible that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, the three OH groups could be arranged symmetrically, leading to an overall non-chiral structure.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the three stereocenters (C1, C3, C5) makes the molecule chiral. Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral.

I think in this case, the molecule may be achiral. For example, if the three OH groups are arranged in a way that the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry.

So, perhaps the molecule is not chiral, so no optical activity.

Alternatively, if all three OH groups are on the same face, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about another approach. 

Wait, another way: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. If all three stereocenters are s, how does that affect the symmetry?

In a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at 1,3,5 positions, imagine that the ring is symmetric with a three-fold axis. If all OHs are in the same configuration, that symmetry might result in the molecule being achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because each OH is on a different carbon, leading to a lack of a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of the molecule as having three chiral centers, but arranged in a symmetric way. For example, if the configuration is such that all three OHs are on the same face, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, no, imagine that each OH is on the same face. The ring would look like a trigonal arrangement, but the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of a meso compound, but with three stereocenters. I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. For example, if the configuration is such that each OH is mirrored across the plane, making the molecule achiral.

In (1s,3s,5s), each OH is on the same side of the ring. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry cutting through the ring, making it achiral. So, the molecule is not chiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should think of it as the molecule being superimposable on its mirror image. If it's symmetric, then yes, it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three substituents break the symmetry.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on this one, but I'll proceed with the initial thought that it's not chiral.

Seventh compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butan-1-one (which is (CH2)3-CO). So, the structure is cyclopentyl-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-CO.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So, the structure is:

CO-(CH2)3-Cyclopentyl?

Wait, no, butan-1-one is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but in this compound, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the ketone is on C1, and substituents are on C3 (methyl) and C1 (cyclopentyl).

Structure:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), a CH2 group on C2, a methyl on C3, and a CH3 on C4.

Wait, so the structure is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons with the ketone on C1. So, the structure would be:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are cyclopentyl and three CH2 groups. No, wait, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is attached to the cyclopentyl group and three other groups. Wait, no, the butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So, the structure would be:

CO-(CH2)3-Cyclopentyl? No, because butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO-.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but regardless, the main point is whether the molecule has a chiral center.

Looking at the molecule, the carbonyl group is on C1. The substituents attached to C1 are the cyclopentyl group, a CH2 group leading to C2, and two more substituents? Wait, no, the carbonyl carbon is C=O, so it's double-bonded to O and single-bonded to the cyclopentyl and the adjacent carbon (C2). So, the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are cyclopentyl, a CH2CH2CH3 group (if the rest is CH2CH(CH3)2?), but wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

So, the carbonyl carbon is connected to:

- cyclopentyl group.

- CH2 group leading to C2.

- And the rest?

Wait, no, carbonyl carbons are double-bonded to O, so they have two substituents. So the substituents on C1 (carbonyl carbon) are cyclopentyl and the rest of the chain, which is (CH2)2CH(CH3). So, the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are cyclopentyl and a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3 group.

Wait, but that's only two substituents. So, no chiral centers in this molecule, because the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and has two substituents: cyclopentyl and a longer chain. Therefore, no chiral centers. So, the molecule is not chiral and doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Now, let's tally the compounds that exhibit optical activity.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No (no chiral centers).
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes (stereocenters present).
3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (meso compound).
4. (2R,3R)-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes (chiral).
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes (chiral center).
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (possibly symmetric, so not chiral).
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No (no chiral centers).

So, the compounds that are optically active are numbers 2,4,5. That's three compounds.

Wait, but earlier I thought the sixth compound might not be chiral, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate compound 6.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

If all three OH groups are on the same face, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the ring is symmetric, could the molecule be achiral? Alternatively, it could be chiral because the arrangement of substituents lacks a plane of symmetry.

Wait, another approach: if all three stereocenters are s, and the positions are 1,3,5, which are symmetrically placed on the ring, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, a plane that bisects the ring between C2 and C6, reflecting C1 to C5 and C3. Wait, but if all three are same configuration, maybe it's a meso form.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not meso, but chiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe another way to think: if the molecule has three stereocenters but no internal plane of symmetry, it's chiral.

In this case, the three OH groups are on positions 1,3,5, which are every other carbon. If all are in the same configuration, perhaps the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

Wait, considering that (1s,3s,5s) could be a configuration that mirrors the molecule, making it achiral.

Hmm. Well, regardless, I'll proceed with the initial count of three active compounds (2,4,5). But wait, perhaps I missed another.

Wait, let me recount:

Compound 2: Yes.
Compound 4: Yes.
Compound 5: Yes.

That's three.

But wait, what about compound 6? If it's chiral, that would be four. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should include it. Let me think again.

If the molecule is cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all OH groups in the same configuration, whether it's chiral depends on whether there's a plane of symmetry. If the three OHs are all on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making it achiral.

Wait, no. Wait, imagine a cyclohexane ring with OH groups at 1,3,5. If all OHs are on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry in the middle, making it achiral.

Wait, yes. For example, if you have a trigonal arrangement with all OHs on the same face, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry that runs perpendicular to the plane of the ring through the center. So, the molecule would be achiral.

So, compound 6 is not chiral.

So, the total is three compounds that are optically active: 2,4,5.

Wait, but wait. What about compound 6? Another approach: the presence of three stereocenters doesn't automatically make a molecule chiral. It depends on whether it's a meso compound or not.

In the case of 1,3,5-triol with all s configurations, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. For example, if the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral despite having multiple stereocenters.

So, in that case, it's not chiral.

So, the count remains three.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the molecule again. If the three OH groups are on the same face, the molecule would have a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a single enantiomer, making it chiral.

I'm a bit torn here. I'll proceed with the initial count of three.

So, the answer would be 3, which is option B.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

Wait, but earlier I thought compounds 2,4,5 are active. That's three. So option B is 3.

Wait, but what about the second compound? (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.

That definitely has stereocenters (3aR and 7aS), so it's chiral. So that's one.

Then, compound 4: (2R,3R) — chiral, so that's two.

Compound 5: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol — chiral, three.

So three compounds.

So the correct answer is 3, option B.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is chiral if it has at least one stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or an asymmetric plane, and it is not meso (a compound with an internal plane of symmetry that makes it achiral despite having stereocenters).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is a double bond with substituents on either side. However, it lacks a stereocenter because no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups. Additionally, it does not have an asymmetric plane or internal symmetry.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound has specific stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the R and S configurations. These stereocenters create chirality, and the molecule lacks internal symmetry.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The C2 and C3 carbons are stereocenters, but the molecule is symmetric due to the identical substituents on both carbons. This symmetry makes it a meso compound, which is achiral despite having stereocenters.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is similar to the previous one but lacks symmetry because the configurations at C2 and C3 are the same (both R). This lack of symmetry results in chirality.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The molecule has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on C1 of a cyclohexene ring. The C1 carbon is bonded to four different groups: the hydroxyl group, two adjacent carbons in the ring, and the rest of the ring structure. This makes C1 a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups on a cyclohexane ring at positions 1, 3, and 5. Despite having three stereocenters, the molecule is symmetric due to the trigonal arrangement of the hydroxyl groups, which creates an internal plane of symmetry. This makes it a meso compound and achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The structure is a ketone with a cyclopentyl group on C1 and a methyl group on C3. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to oxygen and bonded to the cyclopentyl group and the rest of the chain. This carbon does not have four different groups, so there are no stereocenters. The molecule is not chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
- **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
- **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
- **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  

This gives a total of **3** compounds.  

**Answer: B**
