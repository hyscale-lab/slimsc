Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, let's think about what I remember from my studies.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? So the spin state vector χ must be [3i, 4]^T. Because in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨S⟩ = ⟨χ| S |χ⟩, where S is the operator we're interested in. In this case, it's S_y, the spin operator along the y-axis.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are used to represent spin operators. Oh right, the spin operator S_y is given by ħ/2 multiplied by the Pauli matrix σ_y. The Pauli σ_y matrix is:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. Yeah, that makes sense. Because for spin-½ particles like electrons, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

Now, to find the expectation value, I need to compute χ† * S_y * χ. Wait, but matrix multiplication is involved here. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's write out the components. χ is [3i, 4]^T, so χ† would be the conjugate transpose, which is [ -3, 4i ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3 (wait, no, wait. Wait, 3i is (0 + 3i), so the conjugate is (0 - 3i), which is -3i. So the first component of χ† is -3i? Wait, wait. Wait, χ is [3i,4], so χ† would be [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3i, 4 ] because 4 is real. No, wait, 4 is real, so its conjugate is itself. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? Because (a + ib)* = a - ib. So 3i is 0 + i3, so the conjugate is 0 - i3, which is -3i.

So χ† is a row vector: [ -3i, 4 ].

Then S_y is (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix. So S_y is:

(ħ/2) * [[0, -i],
          [i, 0]]

So when we compute χ† S_y χ, it's [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by S_y, then multiplied by χ.

Wait, but let me compute this step by step. Let's do χ† S_y first, then multiply by χ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute S_y acting on χ first, then take the inner product with χ†.

Let me compute S_y χ first.

S_y χ = (ħ/2) * σ_y * χ.

Let me compute σ_y * χ. The σ_y matrix is 2x2, χ is 2x1.

So σ_y * χ:

[ [0, -i],        [3i]
  [i, 0] ] * [4 ]

So the first component is 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = (-i)*4 = -4i.

Second component is i*(3i) + 0*4 = i*(3i) = 3i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Multiply by (ħ/2):

S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ]^T = [ (-4i ħ)/2, (-3 ħ)/2 ].

Now, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ], so the inner product χ† (S_y χ) is:

(-3i) * [ (-4i ħ)/2 ] + (4) * [ (-3 ħ)/2 ]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i ħ/2 ) = (12 i² ħ) / 2. i squared is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12. So the first term is (-12 ħ)/2 = -6 ħ.

Wait wait, wait, let me compute that again. So (-3i) multiplied by (-4i ħ/2). Multiply the numbers:

(-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i^2 → 12*(-1) = -12. So the first term is (-12 * ħ) / 2? No, wait. Let me calculate it step by step.

The first component of S_y χ is (-4i ħ)/2.

So χ† [0] (the first component) is -3i. Multiply by that component: (-3i) * (-4i ħ/2) = (12 i² ħ) / 2. Because (-3i)*(-4i) is (12 i²). So 12 i² is 12*(-1) = -12. So this part is (-12 ħ)/ 2 = -6 ħ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it again.

Wait, (-3i) multiplied by (-4i ħ/2) would be:

(-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² → 12*(-1) = -12 → so the product is (-12 ħ)/2 = -6 ħ.

Wait no, because (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = -12, but then multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, let me compute each term properly.

First term: ( -3i ) * ( (-4i ħ) / 2 ) = (-3i) * (-4i ħ ) * (1/2) 

The multiplication order: compute (-3i)*(-4i) first.

(-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i² → 12*(-1) = -12.

So the first term: (-12 ħ) * (1/2) = -6 ħ.

Second term: (4) * ( (-3 ħ)/2 ) = 4 * (-3 ħ) / 2 = (-12 ħ) / 2 = -6 ħ.

So the total is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ
