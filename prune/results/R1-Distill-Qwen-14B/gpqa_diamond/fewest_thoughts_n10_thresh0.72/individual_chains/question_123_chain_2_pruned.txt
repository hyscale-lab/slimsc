Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, so wait, the problem involves relative motion between two inertial frames. Since both are inertial, there's no acceleration involved, which simplifies things. I think this is a problem about relative velocity and time dilation, but wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about relativity effects like time dilation or length contraction. Oh, but wait, the options are all in the order of millions of kilometers, so maybe it's just a straightforward relative velocity problem without considering relativity effects.

Wait, but the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So perhaps there's a time dilation factor to consider here. Because from the Galaxy's frame, the time might be different. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think. The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So the time experienced in the ejecta is 50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, the time elapsed might be different because of time dilation due to their relative velocity.

Wait, but the problem states
