Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two parts: the first is a reaction with BuLi and then H+, and the second is a Cope rearrangement under heat. The starting materials are given, and I need to pick the major products A and B from the options.

Let me tackle the first part first. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring attached to an OCH2 group. The substituent on the oxygen is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let's break it down. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2, but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 2? No, wait, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- but starting from the 1 position. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CH2-benzene. Wait, no, wait: the starting material is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So the substituent is OCH2- attached to the benzene, and the O is connected to (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl). So the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH- with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. But wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's CH2-CH2=CH-CH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait,
