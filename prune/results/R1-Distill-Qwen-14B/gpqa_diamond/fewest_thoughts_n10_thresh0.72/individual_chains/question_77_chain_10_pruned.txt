Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still learning. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the question is about two reactions: the first involves a Cope rearrangement, and the second is another type of rearrangement, maybe also a pericyclic reaction. The task is to determine the major products A and B based on the given structures and reagents.

Looking at the first reaction: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement typically involves 1,5-dienes and is done under heat or light. But wait, the first step is BuLi, which is a strong base. Maybe this is a different kind of rearrangement or a conjugate addition?

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is not the Cope rearrangement itself but something else. Let me think. The molecule has an enol ether structure. The structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So, the benzene has a substituent that's an oxygen connected to a CH2 group, which is then connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is something like benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no: Wait, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but wait, no. Let me write the structure correctly.

The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So, 1-yl means the substituent is attached at the first carbon. So the group is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2 (but wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me count: but-2-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So it's CH2-CH2-
