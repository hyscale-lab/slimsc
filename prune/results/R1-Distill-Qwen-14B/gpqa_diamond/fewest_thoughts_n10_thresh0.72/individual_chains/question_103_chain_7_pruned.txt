Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let me break it down.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule. So, benzene ring with substituents. The ethanone part is a ketone, so that's a carbonyl group attached to the ring. Then, looking at the substituents, there's a bromine and a nitro group. The positions are 3-bromo and 5-nitro. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering starts such that the substituents are in positions 3 and 5. So, if the ketone is in position 1, then positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other relative to the ketone.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That structure implies that the phenyl ring is attached to the carbonyl group. So the carbonyl is at position 1 (the ketone), and the phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment. Oh wait, no. Alternatively, the ethanone is R-CO-CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, (propan-2-one). So, the structure is a benzene ring connected to a COCH3 group, and on the benzene, there's a Br at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5, assuming the ring is attached to the COCH3 at position 1.

Wait, maybe I should sketch it out. Let's imagine the benzene ring. The ketone is connected to the ring at position 1. Then, looking from that position, the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So the ring has substituents in the meta positions relative to each other, but considering the point of attachment.

So, the substituents are Br at the 3 position and nitro at 5
