Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again. 

The question says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, which probably means we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like thatâ€”just focus on the potential energy. 

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. And the question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, so I think this has to do with electric potential energy because we're dealing with charges. Since it's an isolated system, the energy should be all about the potential energy between the charges.

Wait, so each charge is 2e. So the charge of each particle is 2 times the elementary charge. The elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the setup: 12 charges are at a fixed distance of 2 meters from point P. The 13th charge is at P. So, I'm imagining point P, with the 13th charge fixed there. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. 

But wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, their distances from P are fixed. But what about their distances from each other? Are they all at the same point 2 meters from P, or are they each at different points? Oh, since each is 2 meters from P, perhaps they are all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters, but their exact positions might not matter if they're symmetrically placed. But wait, the problem doesn't specify any symmetry among the 12, so maybe I don't have to consider their mutual distances. Because if they're each fixed at 2 m from P, maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of them and the charge at P. Hmm, but that's probably not the case. Because in reality, each of the 12 charges would also interact with each other. 

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum
