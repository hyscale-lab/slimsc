Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about two different reactions, A and B, and I need to choose the correct major products from the options given. Let's start by looking at each part separately.

First Reaction: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Hmm, BuLi is a strong base, commonly used in deprotonations or as a strong nucleophile. After BuLi, they add H+, so I think it's an acid workup.

Wait, the starting molecule has an ether linkage. The structure is like benzene with an OCH2 group, and attached to the oxygen is a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me draw that. So, the group is CH2-O-(CH2CH2CH(CH3)), but wait no, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-O-CH2-Ph. Wait, no, wait: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but numbering starts from the end closest to the substituent. Oh wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2? Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, the position is different. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2-, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, but the substituent is at position 1. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached via the first carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-O-CH2-Ph? Wait, no. Let me write it properly.

The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is O-CH2-Ph attached to the but-2-en-1-yl group
