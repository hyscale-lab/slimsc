Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of these two reactions. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The first part is a reaction with ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene treated with BuLi and then H+. The second part is a more complex molecule undergoing a Cope rearrangement when heated.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So the benzene ring is attached to a CH2-O group. The oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure of that substituent is CH2-O-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with the double bond at position 2. Wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, waitâ€”no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the substituent wrong.

Wait, the substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-CH(C H2 CH3)-CH2-CH2 ? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait. Let me number the butenyl group as 1,2,3,4. So the substituent is 1-yl, so the first carbon is attached to the oxygen. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 2 and 3? No, no, for but-2
