Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The energy E is given by E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy will be quantized based on their quantum number n.

Hmm, right. Since the particles are spin-1/2, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). The energy for each level is given by E_n = (n²)E, since E is the base unit when n=1.

Wait, so for each particle, their energy is n² times E. But because they're fermions, each can't have the same n. So I need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

But wait, how do the quantum numbers work for multiple particles? Since they're spin-1/2, each has a spin quantum number s=1/2, so the possible spin states are up and down. So for each energy level n, you can have two particles: one with spin up and another with spin down. So each n can hold two particles.

Okay, so let's think about filling the levels. The ground state (lowest energy) would have the lowest possible n values filled with as many particles as possible.

So we have four particles. Let's list the n levels in order:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold 2 particles
n=3: can hold 2, but we only have four particles total.

Wait, but four particles: n=1 can take 2, n=2 can take the next 2. So all four particles would be in n=1 and n=2 levels.

But wait, the problem is about the system of four particles. So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. But wait, no, for identical particles, we can't just sum individual energies because their wavefunctions are anti-symmetrized. But in the case of non-interacting particles, which I think is the case here because the potential is infinite and we don't mention any interactions, the total energy is the sum of the individual energies. Because the Hamiltonian for each particle is

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical particles. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well depend on the quantum number n squared. Oh right, the formula is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is given here as E multiplied by n squared, since E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is E times n².

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so I think this means they're fermions. Because spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

In a 1D infinite well, each particle has quantum numbers including n (the principal quantum number), and since it's one-dimensional, there's only n to consider. Spin is another quantum number. Spin-1/2 means each particle has two possible spin states, up or down.

So for four identical spin-1/2 particles, each can occupy the same spatial state if their spins are different. Oh wait, no, because for the same spatial state (same n), the spin part can be either up or down. Since there are two spin states, each n can hold two particles.

Wait, but actually, in a 1D well, each spatial state is characterized by n. And each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins. So the maximum number of particles that can occupy a single n is two.

So, the first thing is to figure out how the four particles will fill up the energy levels. Let's think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration.

In the ground state, the particles will fill the lowest possible energy levels, with their spins appropriately arranged to obey the Pauli exclusion. So for four particles:

- The first two go into the n=1 level, each with opposite spins. So two particles in n=1.
- Then the next two have to go into higher levels. But wait, can they go into the same n=2 level
