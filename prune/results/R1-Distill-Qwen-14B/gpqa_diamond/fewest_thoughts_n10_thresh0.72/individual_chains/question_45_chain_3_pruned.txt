Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The energy E is given by E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy will be quantized based on their quantum number n.

Hmm, right. Since the particles are spin-1/2, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels depend only on the principal quantum number n, which is a positive integer (n=1,2,3,...). The energy for each level is given by E_n = (n²)E, since E is the base unit when n=1.

Wait, so for each particle, their energy is n² times E. But because they're fermions, each can't have the same n. So I need to arrange them in the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

But wait, how do the quantum numbers work for multiple particles? Since they're spin-1/2, each has a spin quantum number s=1/2, so the possible spin states are up and down. So for each energy level n, you can have two particles: one with spin up and another with spin down. So each n can hold two particles.

Okay, so let's think about filling the levels. The ground state (lowest energy) would have the lowest possible n values filled with as many particles as possible.

So we have four particles. Let's list the n levels in order:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold 2 particles
n=3: can hold 2, but we only have four particles total.

Wait, but four particles: n=1 can take 2, n=2 can take the next 2. So all four particles would be in n=1 and n=2 levels.

But wait, the problem is about the system of four particles. So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy. But wait, no, for identical particles, we can't just sum individual energies because their wavefunctions are anti-symmetrized. But in the case of non-interacting particles, which I think is the case here because the potential is infinite and we don't mention any interactions, the total energy is the sum of the individual energies. Because the Hamiltonian for each particle is
