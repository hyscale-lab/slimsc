Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical particles. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well depend on the quantum number n squared. Oh right, the formula is E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is given here as E multiplied by n squared, since E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is E times n².

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so I think this means they're fermions. Because spin-1/2 particles are fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

In a 1D infinite well, each particle has quantum numbers including n (the principal quantum number), and since it's one-dimensional, there's only n to consider. Spin is another quantum number. Spin-1/2 means each particle has two possible spin states, up or down.

So for four identical spin-1/2 particles, each can occupy the same spatial state if their spins are different. Oh wait, no, because for the same spatial state (same n), the spin part can be either up or down. Since there are two spin states, each n can hold two particles.

Wait, but actually, in a 1D well, each spatial state is characterized by n. And each spatial state can have two particles with opposite spins. So the maximum number of particles that can occupy a single n is two.

So, the first thing is to figure out how the four particles will fill up the energy levels. Let's think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration.

In the ground state, the particles will fill the lowest possible energy levels, with their spins appropriately arranged to obey the Pauli exclusion. So for four particles:

- The first two go into the n=1 level, each with opposite spins. So two particles in n=1.
- Then the next two have to go into higher levels. But wait, can they go into the same n=2 level
