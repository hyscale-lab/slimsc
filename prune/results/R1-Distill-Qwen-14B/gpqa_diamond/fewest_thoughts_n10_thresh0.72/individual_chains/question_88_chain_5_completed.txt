Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to unpack this. I remember that rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? And the question is about an experiment where they tag the inner capsid proteins with GFP and give them to mice orally.

So they used oral gavage. When I think of the digestive system, the stomach has strong acids. Oh wait, the question says some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. That makes sense because the stomach's acidic environment can break down proteins. So the GFP, which is a protein tag, probably gets denatured or digested there. But some of them made it through, right?

Then, the ones that survived the stomach acid were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines. So the GFP-labeled proteins must have been taken up by the immune cells there.

They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Peyer patches are sites where immune responses, especially against pathogens entering through the gut, are initiated. So the immune cells there probably took up the rotavirus capsid proteins.

They then sequenced the variable heavy chain gene of these cells and found high variability. Wait, variable regions in antibodies are crucial because they determine the specificity. High variability suggests that these cells are undergoing a process that creates diverse antibodies.

What processes are involved in antibody diversity? I remember that VDJ recombination happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow. V (variable), D (diversity), J (joining) segments are combined to create the variable region. But wait, this is in developing B cells, and the question is about cells in Peyer's patches.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cells have been activated. This process introduces mutations in the variable region, increasing diversity, especially in response to antigenic challenges. So when an antigen is encountered, B cells in the germinal centers undergo this process to fine-tune their antibody specificity.

So in this case, the cells from the Peyer patches are proliferating and showing high variability in their variable heavy chain genes. That sounds like somatic hypermutation because that's when the genes are being mutated to create more diverse antibodies.

Other options: complement activation is more about the classical pathway leading to opsonization or lysis, not about gene variability. Class switching recombination changes the isotype of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but not the variable regions. VDJ is during initial B cell development, not in response to a specific antigen in the periphery.

So the process here must be somatic hypermutation. That's option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are exposed to stomach acid, which destroys some of the fluorescence, and the remaining proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. These patches are immune sites where the tagged proteins are taken up by immune cells. The proliferating cell population isolated from these patches shows high variability in their variable heavy chain genes.

This variability suggests a process that generates diverse antibody specificities. Among the options:

- **Somatic hypermutation** occurs after B cell activation and introduces mutations in the variable regions of antibodies, increasing diversity in response to antigens. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **VDJ recombination** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes the initial diversity of antibodies but does not explain the observed variability in mature B cells.
- **Complement activation** and **class switching recombination** are unrelated to the variability in variable heavy chain genes.

The high variability observed is consistent with **somatic hypermutation**, which fine-tunes antibody specificity in response to antigenic stimulation. 

Answer: A
