Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given data includes the distance to the galaxy and the angular size of the event horizon as seen from that distance.

Alright, so the problem states that the galaxy is at a distance d of 10^10 parsecs. The angular size θ is 10^-17 degrees. I need to find the entropy of the black hole, and the options are given in powers of 10^something J/K.

Wait, I remember that entropy for a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So the steps I need to take are: find the radius of the event horizon, calculate the area, and then plug into the entropy formula.

But wait, how do I find the radius? Well, the problem gives me the angular size θ and the distance d. Oh right, the angular size θ in radians is approximately equal to the size of the object divided by the distance to the object when the angle is very small. So θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius of the event horizon.

But wait, θ is given in degrees. I need to convert that to radians because the formula I'm thinking of uses radians. Oh right, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ
