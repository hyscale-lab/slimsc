Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit stuck, but I'll walk through it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, I'll read through the reactions given:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think I need to identify what each compound is. Let's start with the reactions.

Reaction 1: A + 8B → C. The product C is bright red. Hmm, bright red makes me think of things like rubies or maybe certain transition metal compounds. Wait, maybe it's something like sulfur? No, sulfur is yellow. Oh, wait, maybe it's a nitrate? Or perhaps a transition metal oxide that's red. Alternatively, could C be something like a chromium compound? Or maybe it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, the next reaction: C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. What's a bright red product that when reacted with another gas produces something dangerous. Also, the third reaction is C with water gives A, F, and G. So, C is reacting with water to form A and two acids. That suggests C is likely a salt, because when salts react with water, they can hydrolyze into acids and bases, but here it's only acids. So maybe C is a nitride? Or maybe it's a sulfide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal oxide that's amphoteric.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide that when reacted with water gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a mixture of metal oxides or maybe a dimer.

Let me think about the third reaction: C + H2O →
