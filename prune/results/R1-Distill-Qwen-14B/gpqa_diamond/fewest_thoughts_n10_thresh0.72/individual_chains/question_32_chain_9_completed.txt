Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let's see. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li-6 maybe? Because regular lithium has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Lithium-6. Right.

So the problem is asking for the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I think this is a relativistic energy problem because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, so we can't use classical mechanics here. Relativistic effects would definitely come into play.

First, I need to find the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. Lithium-6 has an atomic number of 3, so 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and same for a neutron. So each proton is about 938 MeV, same for neutron. So for Li-6, the total rest mass would be (3 + 3) * 938 MeV. Wait, but actually, the nucleus mass isn't just the sum of protons and neutrons because of binding energy. Oh, wait, but for this purpose, maybe they're using the sum of individual nucleon masses as the rest mass. Or perhaps the actual mass of Li-6 is what I should use. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Let me think. Let's calculate that. So 6 nucleons, each about 938 MeV/c². So 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, that's the total rest mass. But in reality, the mass of Li-6 is a bit less than that because of the binding energy. Oh wait, wait a second. No, the binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together. So the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy (since energy is mass, so binding energy would reduce the mass). But wait, wait, that's not right. No, the binding energy is actually the energy released when the nucleus is formed, so the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons because mass is converted into binding energy. So the rest mass of Li-6 would be less than 6 * 938 MeV. But without the exact value, maybe the question assumes the sum of the individual masses. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the mass number as 6 and the atomic mass unit (u) to calculate the rest mass.

Wait, the atomic mass unit is about 931.5 MeV/c². So for Li-6, the mass is approximately 6 * 1.0087 u (wait, the exact mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u). Wait, but for Li-6, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So let me calculate the exact mass.

Proton mass: 1.007276 u each. Neutron: 1.008665 u each.

So 3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u.
3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u.
Total: 6.047823 u.

But wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.016 u. Because when you form a nucleus, the mass is less than the sum due to binding energy. So the rest mass of the nucleus is around 6.016 u. So the rest mass energy would be 6.016 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus is moving non-relativistically, but no, the speed is 0.96c, which is very relativistic. So we definitely need to use the relativistic energy formula.

The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m0 c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So given v = 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714286.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately:

v = 0.96c
v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c²
v²/c² = 0.9216
1 - v²/c² = 0.0784
sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28
gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy (m0 c²) is the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Hmm, but what is the exact value here? Let me think. The mass of Li-6 is about 6.016 atomic mass units (u). Since 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c², the rest energy is 6.016 * 931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. Then 0.016 * 931.5 is about 14.904 MeV. So total is 5603.9 MeV, which is 5.6039 GeV. Wait, but that's if the rest mass is 6.016 u. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

6.016 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV

0.016 * 931.5 = 14.904 MeV

Total: 5589 + 14.904 = 5603.904 MeV, which is 5.603904 GeV.

So m0 c² = 5.603904 GeV.

Then, gamma is approximately 3.5714, so the total energy is gamma * m0 c².

Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1/(sqrt(1-0.9216)) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = ~3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5.603904 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 * 5.603904 = ?

Let me do it step by step.

5.603904 * 3.57142857.

Alternatively, 3.57142857 is 25/7, approximately. Because 25 divided by 7 is about 3.57142857.

So 5.603904 * 25/7.

Let me compute:

5.603904 / 7 = approx 0.8005577.

0.8005577 *25 = 20.0139425 GeV.

Wait, that would be approximately 20.014 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise numbers for gamma and the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me recalculate gamma:

v = 0.96c → v²/c² = 0.9216.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly? Because 0.28^2=0.0784. So yes, that's correct.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So that's accurate.

Now, the rest mass. Let me use a more precise value for Li-6.

The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. Wait, let me check. The standard atomic weight of Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. So m0 = 6.015122 u.

So m0 c² = 6.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

Calculating that:

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.015122 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315, 0.005122 *931.5 ≈ 4.766 MeV.

So 9.315 +4.766 ≈14.081 MeV.

Total m0 c^2 = 5589 +14.081 =5603.081 MeV =5.603081 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0 c^2 = 3.57142857 *5.603081 GeV.

Let me calculate that accurately.

3.57142857 *5.603081.

Let me break it down:

3 *5.603081 =16.809243.

0.57142857 *5.603081.

0.5 *5.603081=2.8015405.

0.07142857 *5.603081.

0.07 *5.603081≈0.39221567.

0.00142857 *5.603081≈ approx 0.007998.

Adding those: 2.8015405 +0.39221567=3.193756 +0.007998=3.201754.

So total is 16.809243 +3.201754 =20.010997 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.011 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for gamma.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise values.

v = 0.96c → beta=0.96.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... exactly.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the exact calculation, including perhaps the exact value of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is calculated using the exact number of nucleons.

Wait, let me consider that Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons: 3 *939.565=2818.695 MeV.

Total sum: 2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV.

Which is 5.633511 GeV.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is less than that, because of binding energy. So the rest mass energy is less than 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but how much less? The binding energy for Li-6 is about 7.44 MeV. Because the binding energy per nucleon is about 2.6 MeV for light nuclei. For 6 nucleons, that's 6 *2.6=15.6 MeV? Or more accurately, let me look up the binding energy of Li-6.

Wait, maybe I should remember that the binding energy of Li-6 is about 7.44 MeV. So the rest mass energy is (sum of nucleons) minus binding energy.

Sum is 5633.511 MeV, subtract 7.44 MeV: 5626.071 MeV, which is 5.626071 GeV.

So m0 c² is approximately 5.626071 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.626071.

Let me compute that.

3 *5.626071 =16.878213.

0.57142857 *5.626071.

0.5 *5.626071=2.8130355.

0.07142857 *5.626071 ≈0.402748.

So 2.8130355 +0.402748 ≈3.2157835.

Total = 16.878213 +3.2157835 =20.0939965 GeV.

Approximately 20.094 GeV.

Wait, so that's about 20.094 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I need to be more precise with the calculations. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.626071 GeV precisely.

Let me compute this multiplication step by step.

3.57142857 *5.626071.

Let me write 3 + 0.57142857.

3 *5.626071 =16.878213.

0.57142857 *5.626071.

Compute 0.5 *5.626071 =2.8130355.

Compute 0.07142857 *5.626071.

Let me compute 0.07 *5.626071 =0.39382497.

0.00142857 *5.626071 ≈0.007998 (same as before).

So 0.39382497 +0.007998≈0.40182297.

So 0.5 part is 2.8130355, 0.07142857 part is 0.40182297.

Adding together: 2.8130355 +0.40182297 =3.21485847.

So total E =16.878213 +3.21485847 =20.09307147 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.093 GeV. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the rest mass calculation?

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is higher? Let me see. Let me get the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact mass of Lithium-6 is about 6.015122 u. Because the atomic weight is 6.941, but that's the average of isotopes. Wait, no, the mass of each isotope is its own value. So for Li-6, the mass is 6.015122 u.

So m0 c² =6.015122 u * 931.49406 MeV/u.

Let me compute that accurately.

6 *931.49406 =5588.96436 MeV.

0.015122 u *931.49406 MeV/u.

Compute 0.01 *931.49406 =9.3149406 MeV.

0.005122 *931.49406 = let's compute 0.005 *931.49406 =4.6574703 MeV.

0.000122 *931.49406 ≈0.113242 MeV.

So sum:9.3149406 +4.6574703 +0.113242=14.085653 MeV.

Total m0 c² =5588.96436 +14.085653=5603.04999 MeV=5.60304999 GeV.

So E =gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.60304999 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60304999.

Compute 3 *5.60305=16.80915.

0.57142857 *5.60305.

0.5 *5.60305=2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305 ≈0.40175.

So sum:2.801525 +0.40175=3.203275.

Total E=16.80915 +3.203275=20.012425 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.012 GeV. Hmm, not matching any of the options exactly. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

So 20.012 is closer to option C (20.132) than any others.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the mass of the nucleus is 6 u. Because the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u, so the rest mass energy is 6.015122 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the individual proton and neutron masses without considering binding energy. Let's try that.

Each proton:938.272 MeV/c².

Each neutron:939.565 MeV/c².

So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons, sum is:

3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV.

So m0 c²=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

Then, E =gamma * m0 c² =3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that:

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈0.40345.

Sum:2.8167555 +0.40345=3.2202055.

Total E=16.900533 +3.2202055=20.1207385 GeV.

So about 20.1207 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's very close. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Oh, because the problem may not consider the binding energy and just uses the sum of nucleon masses. So in that case, the energy would be approximately 20.12 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). So option C is the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact gamma calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma precisely.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So the exact value of gamma is 25/7, as 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So E= (25/7) * m0 c².

Using m0 c² as 5.633511 GeV, E=25/7 *5.633511.

25 *5.633511=140.837775.

Divided by 7:140.837775 /7=20.119682 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.11968 GeV, which is about 20.12 GeV.

But looking at option C, it's 20.132 GeV. That's a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps due to more precise calculation of gamma or rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the rest mass.

The exact rest mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u.

So m0 c^2=6.015122 *931.49406 MeV.

6.015122 *931.49406 = ?

Let me compute:

6 *931.49406 =5588.96436 MeV.

0.015122 *931.49406.

0.01 *931.49406=9.3149406 MeV.

0.005122 *931.49406 =0.005122 *931.49406.

Compute 0.005 *931.49406=4.6574703.

0.000122 *931.49406≈0.113242.

So 4.6574703 +0.113242=4.7707123.

So total 9.3149406 +4.7707123=14.0856529 MeV.

So m0 c^2=5588.96436 +14.0856529=5603.05 MeV=5.60305 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.60305.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

3.57142857 *5.60305 = ?

3 *5.60305=16.80915.

0.57142857 *5.60305.

0.5 *5.60305=2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305= approx. 0.40175 (exact: 5.60305 *0.07142857).

Let me compute 5.60305 *0.07142857.

5.60305 *0.07=0.3922135.

5.60305 *0.00142857 ≈0.007998.

Sum:0.3922135 +0.007998=0.4002115.

Wait, that's more precise.

So 0.5 part is 2.801525, 0.07142857 part is 0.4002115.

Total: 2.801525 +0.4002115=3.2017365.

So E=16.80915+3.2017365=20.0108865 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.01 GeV, which is a bit lower than option C.

Hmm, but earlier when I considered the sum of individual nucleon masses (without binding energy), I got about 20.12 GeV, which is closer to option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the nucleus is composed of 6 nucleons each with a mass of 938 MeV, so 6 *938=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

Then E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628≈0.402.

So sum:2.814+0.402=3.216.

Total E=16.884+3.216=20.1 GeV.

So that's 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

But why would the problem ignore binding energy? Because perhaps in high-energy physics, the rest mass used is the sum of the individual nucleon masses, especially for heavy ions. So perhaps that's the approach.

In that case, the rest mass energy is 5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.628= ?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.028 *3.57142857≈0.100.

So sum:2.14285714 +0.100=2.24285714.

Total E:17.85714285 +2.24285714=20.1 GeV.

Wait, more accurately, 3.57142857 *5.628 = let me compute it precisely.

3.57142857 *5.628:

Let me write it as (3 + 0.57142857) *5.628.

3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

Compute 5.628 *0.5=2.814.

5.628 *0.07142857.

0.07 *5.628 =0.394.

0.00142857 *5.628≈0.008.

So sum:0.394 +0.008=0.402.

So 5.628 *0.07142857 ≈0.402.

So 0.57142857 *5.628 =2.814 +0.402 =3.216.

So E=16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Hmm, so that's 20.1 GeV, which is option C (20.132 GeV) is very close.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To calculate the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \), we have:

\[
v^2/c^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216
\]

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]

\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} = 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \)
The nucleus in question is lithium-6 (Li-6), which consists of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using the approximate rest mass of Li-6 as \( 6.015122 \, u \) (atomic mass units), where \( 1 \, u = 931.49406 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.015122 \times 931.49406 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
6 \times 931.49406 = 5588.96436 \, \text{MeV}
\]

\[
0.015122 \times 931.49406 \approx 14.08565 \, \text{MeV}
\]

\[
m_0 c^2 = 5588.96436 + 14.08565 = 5603.04999 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy \( E \)
Using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

Substitute \( \gamma = 3.57142857 \) and \( m_0 c^2 = 5.60305 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.60305
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
3 \times 5.60305 = 16.80915
\]

\[
0.57142857 \times 5.60305 \approx 3.20174
\]

\[
E = 16.80915 + 3.20174 = 20.01089 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation
If the problem assumes the rest mass is the sum of individual nucleon masses (ignoring binding energy), the rest mass energy becomes:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6 \times 938.272 \, \text{MeV} = 5628 \, \text{MeV} = 5.628 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Recomputing \( E \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.628
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
3 \times 5.628 = 16.884
\]

\[
0.57142857 \times 5.628 \approx 3.216
\]

\[
E = 16.884 + 3.216 = 20.1 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which aligns with the assumption that the rest mass is the sum of individual nucleon masses.

**Answer: C**
