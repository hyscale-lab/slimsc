Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

First, the problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. I should probably convert that to liters because molarity is in mol/L. Oh right, 1 cm³ is 0.001 liters, so 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters. 

The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that the molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. 

I think I need to find the moles of each compound. So for KH2PO4, the moles would be mass divided by molar mass. That would be 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that: approximately 0.007355 mol. 

For Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let's see, that's about 0.005612 mol. 

Wait, but how do these relate to orthophosphate ions? Orthophosphate is H3PO4, or maybe it's the HPO4^2- ion? Hmm. I'm a bit confused about the phosphate species. 

I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It dissociates in three steps. The given Ka values are Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3. 

The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3). 
The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). 
The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12).

Orthophosphate ion, I think, refers to HPO4^2- since that's the second dissociation step. So the question is asking about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, our solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let me think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2Na+ and HPO4^2- (and water, but ions are the main point).

So when you mix these two, you have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. 

This sounds like a buffer solution scenario because we have a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). The buffer would be around the second dissociation constant, Ka2.

So, the buffer equation would use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). 

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is the HPO4^2- concentration. But in a buffer solution, the HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

So the buffer is made of H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base). Since we have both, we can use their concentrations to find the pH, but the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The solution has H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4. So the actual species in solution are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But to find the concentration of orthophosphate (HPO4^2-), perhaps we need to consider the equilibrium between the two. Since they form a buffer, the pH will determine their ratio.

But wait, the problem doesn't give pH directly. So maybe I should calculate the pH first using the buffer equation, and then find the HPO4^2- concentration.

Alternatively, since the solution is a mixture of these two, perhaps the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can be determined directly from the moles, and then using Ka2 to relate them.

Let me clarify. The initial moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 are 0.007355 mol. The initial moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4 are
