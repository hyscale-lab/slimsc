Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. Oh right, the question is asking which among the options has the highest density.

Let me look at each option one by one. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D corresponding to each.

Option a is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³. I think Earth is pretty dense because it's a rocky planet, not a gas giant.

Option b is a planet with twice Earth's mass and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if its density is the same as Earth, then its mass and radius must be related in a way that density remains the same. Because density is mass over volume, and volume depends on radius cubed. So if mass doubles, volume would increase by some factor. Let me think: If the mass is 2 Earth masses, then if density is same, volume would be mass divided by density. So 2 Earth masses / 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but Earth's volume is (4/3)πr³. So if the planet has the same density as Earth, then when mass doubles, the radius must also change. Let me see. For same density, Volume = mass / density. So V2 = 2*M_earth / (5.5). Earth's volume is M_earth / 5.5. So V2 is twice that. So the radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. So the radius is bigger than Earth, but density same as Earth. So this planet's density is same as Earth, so 5.5. So same as option a.

Option c is a planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Same composition implies same density because composition determines density. So if it's same density, then mass is 5x Earth's, and radius would be cube root of (5) times Earth's radius. Because volume scales with radius cubed, and mass scales with volume (since density is same). So density is 5.5.

Option d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density as Earth, 5.5, and radius would be cube root of 0.5 times Earth's radius.

Wait, but the question is about the highest density. All options a, b, c, d have
