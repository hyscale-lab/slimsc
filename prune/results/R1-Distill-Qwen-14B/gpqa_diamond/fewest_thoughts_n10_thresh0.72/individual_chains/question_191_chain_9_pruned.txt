Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4. Let me try to walk through each step carefully.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw the structure in my mind. The cyclohexanone ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so -CH2OH). Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is like an isopropenyl groupâ€”so a CH2 connected to a double bond, making it CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(=CH2)-, right? So the substituent is attached to the cyclohexane at position 5 as a CH2 group connected to a double bond where the substituent is on the adjacent carbon. So it's CH2-CH(CH2) with a double bond between the first and second carbons. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C=CH2, but attached at the middle carbon. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as CH2 connected to a CH2 with a double bond to another CH2. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(=CH2)-, but attached to the cyclohexane at the middle carbon. So structure-wise, it's like the group is CH2-C(CH2)=CH2? Or maybe more accurately, CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is the substituent where the substituent is on the second carbon of propene. So propene is CH2=CHCH3, but the prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(CH2)=CH2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2, but the substituent is attached at the second carbon. So the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think of it as CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making
