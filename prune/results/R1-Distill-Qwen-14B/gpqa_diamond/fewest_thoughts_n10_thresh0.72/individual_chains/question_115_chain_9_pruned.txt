Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's read the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left, and it has a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate each other, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right direction. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons. The options are A)74, B)172, C)138, D)96 degrees.

Hmm. So I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and conservation laws must apply. So I think I need to use conservation of energy and momentum here.

Let me think about the initial setup. The electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their momenta are in opposite directions along the horizontal axis. But wait, the electron is moving from the left, so its momentum is to the right, and the positron is moving from the right, so its momentum is to the left. Wait, no, because the positron is moving from the right towards the left? Or wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, for example, if the electron is moving from left to right, and the positron is moving from right to left. Wait, no, wait, the problem says they are moving along the horizontal axis. Electron from the left, so direction is to the right. Positron from the right, so direction is to the left. So their momenta are opposite in direction.

Wait, but the Lorentz factor is given, which is gamma = total energy divided by rest mass energy. The rest mass of the electron and positron is the same, since a positron is just the antimatter counterpart of an electron.

But wait, the electron has a charge of -e, and the positron has +e. So when they annihilate, they produce two photons moving in opposite directions, but in this case, both are moving to the right? No, wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right
