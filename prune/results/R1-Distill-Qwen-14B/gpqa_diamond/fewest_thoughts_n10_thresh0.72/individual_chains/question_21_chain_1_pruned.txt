Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. It mentions two compounds, benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and asks which one doesn't show tautomerism. Then, it's about two other compounds, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, and which one shows optical isomerism.

Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out two parts: A and B.

Starting with part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures, like enols and ketones. For example, in a carbonyl compound, like a ketone, if there's an adjacent hydrogen, it can form an enol which is a tautomer. So, if a compound doesn't have the right structure to allow for that shift, it won't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone, right? Structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So, it's like O=C6H4=C=O. Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone can have two double bonds, but in this case, it's a di-ketone. Does benzoquinone have any alpha hydrogens? Because for tautomerism, you need an alpha hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Wait, in benzoquinone, each ketone is at the para position on the benzene ring. Now, the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl groups. So, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. Wait, no, that's
