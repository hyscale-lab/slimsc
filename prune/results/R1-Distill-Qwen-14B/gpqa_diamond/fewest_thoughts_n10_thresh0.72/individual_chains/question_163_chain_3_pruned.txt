Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of acid needed and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with different pH values and volumes.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. When it's dissolved in a strong acid, the acid will react with it. Oh, right, the reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ ions from the acid. Since Fe(OH)3 is a base, it will probably accept protons.

So, I think the reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Yeah, that makes sense because each OH- in Fe(OH)3 would react with an H+ to form water. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 would need 3 moles of H+.

Next, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The mass given is 0.1 grams. Let me find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH) → 55.85 + 3*(17) because each OH is 16+1=17. So 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009359 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009359 ≈ 0.0028077 moles. 

The acid is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it can donate one H+ per molecule, like HCl. So the molarity is 0.1 M, which means moles per liter. The volume needed can be found by moles needed divided by concentration.

Molarity = moles / volume (L), so volume = moles / Molarity. The moles needed are 0.0028077 mol. So volume = 0.0028077 / 0.1 = 0.028077 liters, which is 28.077 cm³. So approximately 28.08 cm³.

Looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³. Close enough. So the first part of the answer is about 28 cm³ of acid.

Now for the pH part. After the reaction, we'll have a solution of Fe^3+ ions. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+. So the Fe^3+ ions will produce H+ ions, increasing the concentration of H+ in solution, which lowers the pH.

I need to find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), because we're adding the acid to
