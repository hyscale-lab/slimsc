Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still a bit new to this stuff.

The question has two parts, A and B, so I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, which is tetrahydrofuran. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. And then H+ is probably a proton source, maybe from water workup later.

So the starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, usually the spiro atom is where the two rings meet. So the structure must be something like a cyclopropane and a cyclopentane connected at one carbon, which also has a vinyl group attached. Wait, wait. Let me visualize this. The spiro is [3.5], which means one ring is 3-membered and the other is 5-membered. Wait, no, the spiro notation is [n.m], meaning one ring is n+1, the other m+1. No, actually, spiro compounds are numbered such that the two rings share one atom. So spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-olâ€”let me think. The 'non' part suggests 9 carbons in total. Wait, no, the spiro system is non, so 9 carbons. The substituents are 1-vinyl and a 5-enol. Okay, maybe the structure is a 5-membered ring and a 3-membered ring? Or perhaps a 4 and 6? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the exact structure isn't critical right now.

What's the reaction conditions? THF as solvent, KH (a strong base, like maybe for deprotonation), and then H+ workup. So, I'm thinking this is a deprotonation followed by some kind of cyclization. Since the starting molecule has a hydroxyl group and a vinyl group, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination or a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, in the presence of a strong base like
