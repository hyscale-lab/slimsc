Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about immunology. Let me read the question again and then break it down.

The question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are given to mice orally. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, which makes sense because stomach acid is strong and can break down proteins. The rest got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, there was high variability. So the question is asking which process this is.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are sites where immune responses to antigens in the gut are initiated. So when rotavirus proteins are given orally, they probably encounter these patches first.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins, so those proteins would be antigens. When these antigens are taken up by the body, immune cells like dendritic cells or macrophages might present them to T cells. But wait, the question is about the variable heavy chain gene. That makes me think of B cells because their antibodies have variable regions.

So, the variable heavy chain gene is part of the B cell receptor. High variability suggests that something is causing the diversity in these genes. I remember that B cells undergo several processes that increase the diversity of their antibodies. 

VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are rearranged to form the heavy chain. This is a process that happens early on, like when B cells are developing. But if the mice were given an antigen after this process, maybe this isn't the one happening here.

Somatic hypermutation is a process that occurs after the B cell has been activated, usually in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This is where B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions, leading to higher affinity antibodies. This process increases the diversity among the B cells, resulting in a varied population of antibodies. So if the variable heavy chains have high variability, this might be due to somatic hypermutation.

Class switching, or isotype switching, is another process where the class of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG) changes. It involves switching the heavy chain's class but doesn't directly increase the variability in the variable region. So probably not this one.

So the situation here is that after antigen exposure, B cells are activating and proliferating. In the Peyer's patches, the antigens are presented, leading to B cell activation. Once activated, these B cells undergo division and during that process, somatic hypermutation occurs, increasing the diversity of the variable regions. That would explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes when they sequenced the cells.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The question involves administering GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus to mice via oral gavage. Some of the fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while the rest becomes entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability, prompting the question of which immunological process is responsible.

Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are key sites for initiating immune responses to antigens in the gut. The GFP-tagged proteins act as antigens, likely being taken up by immune cells such as dendritic cells or macrophages and presented to T cells. The focus on the variable heavy chain gene suggests the involvement of B cells, as their antibodies have variable regions.

Among the processes that increase antibody diversity, **VDJ recombination** occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are rearranged. However, this process does not explain the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene after antigen exposure. **Class switching recombination** involves changing the antibody class (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not directly affect the variability of the variable region. 

**Somatic hypermutation**, on the other hand, is a process that occurs after B cell activation, typically in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. It introduces mutations into the variable regions of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity of antibodies. This process aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain gene, which is consistent with the activation and proliferation of B cells in response to rotavirus antigens in the Peyer's patches.

Thus, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
