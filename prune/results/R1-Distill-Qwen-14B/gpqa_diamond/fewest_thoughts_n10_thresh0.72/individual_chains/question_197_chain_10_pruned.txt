Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out the product. The options are four different compounds, so I'll have to figure out what X is first, and then see what happens when it reacts under those conditions.

The data given are IR and NMR spectra. Let me start by looking at the IR. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500, 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 probably indicates an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's usually seen in carboxylic acids, esters, ketones, etc. But the broad peak in IR often corresponds to O-H in carboxylic acids because they are usually broad and strong. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group here.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H), which is a strong indicator of a carboxylic acid proton. The next one is 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. So, two doublets likely mean a para-disubstituted ring. For example, if two substituents are para to each other, each substituent could cause the protons in their respective positions to couple, giving doublets.

Then there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H). That area is around where you might see a methine (CH) group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester or something similar. But wait, given that there's a carboxylic acid, maybe it's a CH next to something else.

The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps another CH group. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three protons, maybe a CH3 attached to a CH2 or something else. And 0.9 ppm (t,3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the aromatic ring is para-substituted with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. Let's think about the substituents. In the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, so perhaps the substituents are on the para positions relative to each other. One substituent is a carboxylic acid, and the other is a group that has a CH2CH2CH3 or something. Wait, the 1.4 ppm and 0.9 ppm suggest maybe an ethyl group at the end.

Wait, the substituents: if the ring has a para-substituted carboxylic acid and a substituent that's an isobutyl or something. Let me think. Let's sketch this out.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents in para positions. One is the carboxylic acid (COOH), and the other is a side chain. The side chain would have a structure that gives the NMR signals we're seeing.

Looking at the NMR signals: the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group attached to something, maybe a carbonyl. Wait, but if it's a propanoic acid, maybe the structure is something like benzene ring with a COOH group and a CH2CH2CH3 group? Or perhaps a branching.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a triplet, and 0.9
