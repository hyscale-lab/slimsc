Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says it's an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. The problem is about the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone. So, the function f depends on λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis. They want to know the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

I remember that when charges oscillate, especially in an antenna, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the type of antenna. For a dipole antenna, which is a common example, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis, and the power varies with the angle θ.

Wait, the dipole radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has a power distribution proportional to sin²θ. So the intensity, which is power per unit area, varies with θ as sin²θ. But wait, the intensity is also related to the power per unit solid angle. Since solid angle dΩ is sinθ dθ dφ, the power per unit solid angle would be dP/(dΩ) = (something) * sinθ * sin²θ = something * sin³θ. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, the power radiated per unit solid angle is the intensity, I think. For a dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum intensity occurs at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, making it the peak.

But in this question, the maximum power is A. So the maximum of f(θ) is A. They're asking what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees.

Wait, wait, no. The function f is the radiated power per unit solid angle. So f(θ) is the intensity. The maximum intensity (A) is when θ is 90 degrees, I think for a dipole.

So, the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30 degrees would be f(30) divided by A. Because f(θ) is
