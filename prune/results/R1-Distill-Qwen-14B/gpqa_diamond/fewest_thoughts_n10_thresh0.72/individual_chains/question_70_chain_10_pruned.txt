Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll give it a go. Let me read through the question again carefully and break it down step by step.

The question describes several chemical reactions and gives some properties of the products and reactants. The goal is to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, so I'll need to figure out what E looks like.

Let me list out the reactions as I understand them:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F (strong) and G (weak).
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, okay, so I need to deduce the identities of these compounds. Let me think about common reactions that fit these descriptions.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8B → C. Bright red product C could be something like copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, but wait, that's blue. Or maybe something else. Alternatively, considering equivalents, maybe B is a diatomic gas. Since 8 equivalents are used, perhaps B is O2, but 8 moles might form something like an oxide. Alternatively, if B is a diatomic like Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, reaction 4 says D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents are often things like H2O, CH3OH, etc. So if H is a solvent, what could D and B be?

Let me think about reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If B is something like O2, then D could be something that reacts with O2 to form a solvent. For example, maybe D is H2S or something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2, and D is something else.

Wait, another thought: if H is a common solvent like H2O, but that would require D and B to combine to form H2O. But if B is O2, then D would need to be a compound that provides H, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe H is ethanol (C2H5OH), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is something else. But the reaction is D + B → H, which is a solvent. Wait, maybe D is H2O and B is NH3, but then H would be... but NH3 + H2O isn't really a solvent. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, maybe D is NH3 and B is something else. Alternatively, H could be something like methanol (CH3OH), but I'm not sure what D and B would be.

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like HCl, but that's not a solvent. Wait, maybe H is H2O. Wait, but if D and B combine to form H2
