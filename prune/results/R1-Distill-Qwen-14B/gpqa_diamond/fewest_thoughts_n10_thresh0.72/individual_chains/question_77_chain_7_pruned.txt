Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I remember the Cope rearrangement isn't something I'm super confident about. But let's see if I can work through this.

The question has two parts. The first part involves a reaction using BuLi and then H+. The second part is a Cope rearrangement under heat. I need to find the major products A and B from these reactions and match them to the options given.

Let me start with the first reaction. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me draw the structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an OCH2 group, and the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Wait, the butenyl group would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)-, but wait, the numbering is 1-yl, so the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? Wait no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- so maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CH2-Ph? Or wait, no, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl benzene. So the substituent on benzene is OCH2-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl), which is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it correctly.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2- (since the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, so the group starts at carbon 1). Wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-, and then the
