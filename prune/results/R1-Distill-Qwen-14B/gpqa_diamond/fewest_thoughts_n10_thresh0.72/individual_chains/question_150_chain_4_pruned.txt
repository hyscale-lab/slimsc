Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. The reagents are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. The question is to identify the final product from the options given.

First, I need to figure out what the starting compound is based on the NMR data. Let's look at the NMR signals:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet. High chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton or something deshielded like an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So this could be an aldehyde proton.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Downfield for aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Because the coupling suggests two protons, maybe as a pair.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, possibly another set of aromatic protons adjacent to substituents.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. Maybe some protons that are not in a symmetrical environment, like an allylic position or maybe some coupling with other protons. Alternatively, could be due to an aromatic ring with substituents causing different coupling, or maybe some hydroxyl groups or adjacent protons causing broadening.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, probably some CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. Maybe an ether or an alkoxy group.

Hmm. Let me try to piece this together.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. For C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9
