Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So each has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l = 1, because p orbitals have l=1. But wait, the problem is about their coupled angular momentum state, which is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Oh right, so in this state, the individual l's are 1 for each electron, and the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, with m being -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for each electron. They want the joint probability that both L₁z and L₂z have eigenvalues of -ħ. So each would have m values of -1, I suppose, because L_z |l, m> = mħ |l, m>, right?

Wait, but wait. So each electron has its own orbital angular momentum. When you have two particles, their individual states can combine in different ways. So the combined state should be a product of their individual states, but when considering the total angular momentum, it's a coupled state.

But in this case, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the state is a combination of the two individual angular momenta. Hmm, but when you measure L₁z and L₂z, you're projecting each of their angular momenta along the z-axis. The total state is a combination that includes all possible ways the two can add up to l=2 and m=-1.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the total state is formed from the product of individual states. The individual states are |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>. So for two electrons, each with l=1, their product states could be |1, m1> |1, m2>.

The total angular momentum state is a combination of these product states such that their sum gives l=2 and m=-1. So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of the |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait, the problem is about the probabilities when measuring each L_z. So the combined state is a sum of possible
