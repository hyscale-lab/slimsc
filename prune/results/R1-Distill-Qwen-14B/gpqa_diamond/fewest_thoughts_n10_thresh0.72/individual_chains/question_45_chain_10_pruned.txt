Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The answer options are given in terms of E, where E is defined as π²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Wait, right, each particle is spin-1/2, so that's like electrons or something similar. Oh, but wait, the potential well is one-dimensional. So each particle is confined in a 1D box. 

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by the formula E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? So E_n = n² E, where E is as given. 

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. Since they are in a 1D box, the quantum number is just n. Oh wait, but wait, each particle has a spin quantum number too, which can be +1/2 or -1/2.

So, each state in the well is characterized by n and s, where s is the spin. But in a 1D box, the spatial part is
