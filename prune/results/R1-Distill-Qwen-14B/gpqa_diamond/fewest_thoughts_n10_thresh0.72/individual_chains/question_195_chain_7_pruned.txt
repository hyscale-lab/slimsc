Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about two planets in a star system. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and transits its star, which has a radius 1.5 times the Sun's. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period it can have and still show both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm, I remember that for a planet to transit, it must pass directly in front of the star from our point of view. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star from our perspective. So the second planet's orbit must be such that it can both transit and be occulted by the star.

Wait a minute, the key here is the orbital period. The transit and occultation events depend on the orbital distances. If the second planet is too far out, it might not transit because the orbital period is longer, meaning it's farther from the star. But what determines the maximum period?

I think Kepler's third law is involved here. It relates the orbital period and the semi-major axis (given the mass of the star). The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So P² is proportional to a³/(M). 

But wait, in the problem, both planets are around the same star. So the mass of the star is the same for both. That means the ratio of their orbital periods squared is equal to the ratio of their semi-major axes cubed. So (P2/P1)² = (a2/a1)³.

But wait, the problem gives the orbital period of the first planet as 3 days, and asks for the maximum orbital period of the second. So we need to find P2_max.
