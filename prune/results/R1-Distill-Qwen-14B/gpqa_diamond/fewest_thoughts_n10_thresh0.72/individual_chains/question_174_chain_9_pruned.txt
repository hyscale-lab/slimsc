Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem is about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Okay, so the setup is that an atomic nucleus of mass M is initially at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in MeV, which is a much smaller unit than GeV, so relativistic effects might play a role here.

Hmm, okay. First, let me note down the given information.

Initial rest-mass energy: 300 GeV. So, E_initial = 300 GeV.

After fission, two fragments. One is more massive, the other less. Let's denote their masses as m1 and m2. The problem says one is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2 * m2. But wait, the sum of their rest masses is 0.99 M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait, wait. Let me think about that. The initial mass is M; the rest masses of the two fragments sum to 99% of M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

But since m1 = 2 m2, substituting that in: 2m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M => m2 = (0.99 M)/3; m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait. Hold on. The problem says the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So, the initial nucleus had mass M, and the two fragments have rest masses adding to 0.99 M. So, the rest masses are less than the initial mass. That suggests that some energy is released as binding energy, but in this case, it's about the kinetic energy of the fragments.

So, when the nucleus
