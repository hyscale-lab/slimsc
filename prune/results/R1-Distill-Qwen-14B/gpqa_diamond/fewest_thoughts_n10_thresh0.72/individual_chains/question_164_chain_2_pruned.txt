Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, the question is about determining which system is more massive by a certain factor. Let me read it again.

So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) variations for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars. For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocities are related to the masses of the stars. Oh right, from Kepler's laws and the binary star model. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, right? Because the two stars orbit their common center of mass. So the less massive star moves more, hence higher RV amplitude.

So, in each system, the two stars have different masses. The RV amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass of the star. Because the more massive star has a smaller orbit, so its velocity is lower. Yeah, that sounds right. So for each system, the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses.

Let me denote the masses of the two stars in system_1 as M1 and m1, and in system_2 as M2 and m2. Then, the ratio of their velocities would be v1/M1 = v2/M2. Or wait, is it v1 proportional to M2 and v2 proportional to M1? Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the mass function.

The mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by f(M) = (v^3 * P) / (2πG), where v is the RV semi-amplitude, and P is the orbital period. But wait, the mass function depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination angle. Oh wait, but since both systems are eclipsing, the inclination must be near 90 degrees, so the sine of the inclination is 1. So the mass function simplifies to f(M) = ( (v^3 * P) ) / (2πG )

Wait, but the mass function gives the mass of the companion in a certain way. Alternatively, for a binary system, the two stars orbit each other with period P. The radial velocity semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) are proportional to (M2 / (M1 + M2)) and (M1 / (M1 + M2)), respectively. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

In a binary system where the two stars orbit their common center of mass, the more massive star moves less. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So K1 (the velocity of star 1) is proportional to M2, and K2 (velocity of star 2) is proportional to M1. Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. So a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2
