Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The given NMR data is 1H NMR with specific peaks. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that NMR helps determine the structure by showing the environment of each proton. The peaks here are at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d). 

Wait, the compound is an acetate, so it's an ester. The structure likely has an acetyl group (from the acetate) and a propenyl or butenyl group. Let me think about the possible structures.

So, the options are between propenyl and butenyl. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, and butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar, but the substituents might vary.

The key thing is the splitting patterns and the coupling constants. Let me look at the peaks:

At 7.0 ppm, a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, so probably between two vinylic protons. For example, in an allyl or vinyl group, adjacent protons couple with this kind of J value.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq), which suggests it's split by two different sets of neighboring protons. Or maybe it's a doublet with more splitting, but I'm not sure yet.

The singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H usually indicates an acetyl group (OAc), where the methyl is deshielded but not split by anything since it's attached to an oxygen and not next to any other protons. So that's probably the acetate part.

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet for 3H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond. Because in allylic positions, the CH2 protons are usually around 1.5-2.5 ppm, and as a doublet, maybe they're next to a double bond.

Let me sketch possible structures. The acetate would be OAc-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group.

If it's propenyl acetate, R is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that's propenyl acetate. But there are cis and trans versions for propenyl? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, which is a substituent. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH2CH2OAc with a double bond nearby.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure as being an ester where the R group is a substituted propene or butene. Let me think about the possible structures.

Cis and trans refer to the configuration around the double bond. For propenyl, since it's CH2=CHCH2-, the substituents on either side of the double bond are CH3 and CH2OAc. Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but when it's attached to the ester, maybe the substituents are on the same or opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the splitting patterns and how they relate to the structure.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which usually is between two adjacent vinylic protons. So in a trans double bond, each proton is on opposite sides, but wait, cis would have the same side.

Wait, for a trans double bond, the two vinylic protons are on opposite sides, so when you have substituents on either end, the coupling
