Okay, so I need to figure out the lower redshift limit for these neutral hydrogen clouds to be detected using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, let's think about the problem.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, I remember that Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet range. Oh right, because hydrogen's Lyman series transitions involve transitions down to the n=1 energy level. So the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms, right? Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms.

But wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by these clouds. So the absorption occurs at the rest wavelength of Lyman alpha, which is 1216 Angstroms. But what's observed would be redshifted, right? Because the cloud is moving away from us (as per cosmic expansion), so the observed wavelength is longer.

So the observed wavelength is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. 

But wait, the problem is about detecting this absorption with optical ground-based telescopes. Optical light is in the range of about 400-700 nm, which is 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the redshifted Lyman alpha must fall into this range for optical telescopes to see it.

So, if the observed wavelength needs to be in optical, let's calculate the minimum redshift. The minimum redshift occurs when the observed wavelength is just at the lower end of optical, which is about 400 nm, or 4000 Angstroms.

So setting up the equation: lambda_obs = 4000 Angstroms = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z)

Solving for z: (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So z ≈ 2.29. Let me double-check that math. 1216 times 3 is 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216 *3.29... Let's compute 3.29 * 1216. Hmm, 3 * 1
