Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about the extension of the Standard Model using a given Lagrangian. The main goal is to find the approximation of the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different formula.

First, let me parse the given Lagrangian. The relevant terms are:

i \bar{N}_R γ^μ ∂_μ N_R 

So that's the kinetic term for a right-handed singlet fermion N_R. Then there's (1/2)(∂μ φ)^2, which is the kinetic term for a scalar φ. Next is |D^μ S|^2, which is the covariant derivative squared for a scalar doublet S. Then, there's a term -(y_i / 2) φ \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. That looks like a Yukawa coupling term where φ is coupling to the charge-conjugated N fermions, which are singlets. And then there's -g_{iα} \bar{N}_{iR} L_α S, which is another coupling term between the singlet fermions, the lepton doublets L, and the scalar S. Finally, there's a potential V(φ, S, H), but I'm not sure what H is here—maybe another scalar? Oh wait, the given text refers to H as well, with <h> = v, and phi has a VEV of x. Hmm.

Wait, the fields given are N_iR which are singlets (so (1,1,0) under SU(2), SU(3), U(1)), scalar doublet S ~ (1,2,1), and singlet scalar φ ~ (1,1,0). So the potential V is probably involving φ, S, and another scalar H. But I'm not entirely clear on what H is—maybe it's part of the Standard Model Higgs?

Wait, the VEVs are given as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², so ⟨φ⟩ is x and ⟨h⟩ is v. Wait, h must be another field, perhaps the SM Higgs? Because in the Standard Model, the Higgs field is often denoted as H, and the physical Higgs is h. So perhaps φ and h are separate scalars here. So the potential V is a function of φ, S, and H. But I'm not too sure; maybe H is another scalar field in this model.

The question is about the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is broken but some part of the symmetry remains (like a discrete symmetry or something leading to a pseudo-Goldstone). In the Standard Model, the Higgs mechanism breaks the symmetry, and the Higgs is the
