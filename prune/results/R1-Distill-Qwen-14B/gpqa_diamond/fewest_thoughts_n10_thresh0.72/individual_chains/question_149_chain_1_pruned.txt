Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. The shifts are similar, integrals add up to 1H, so it's not like two protons are splitting each other because that usually leads to more splitting. Also, they ruled out spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. Hmm, so maybe it's something else causing two peaks for the same proton.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum. So same molecular weight, same retention time? Wait, same mass but different peaks? Or same mass but different peaks because of structure?

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? The question says the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule. So the mass is the same as the product. So probably not a precursor. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular formula, same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. So in NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the alpha protons would be equivalent in each enantiomer. Wait, but wait, in that case, the NMR would show a single peak because the protons are in equivalent environments. Unless... Oh wait, no. Because in a racemic mixture, the NMR would average out. Unless the coupling is to a chiral center. Wait, but the problem states that the two peaks have similar shifts and equal integral, and the splitting can't be from coupling. So maybe it's not about coupling but maybe diastereotopic protons. Wait, no, enantiomers would have the same NMR, so maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, maybe if the sample isn't pure and has some other isomer. Or perhaps it's a diastereomer, which would have different NMR shifts because the environments are different.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during an amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Double coupling might refer to
