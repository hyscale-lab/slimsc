Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are involved in partial wave expansions, especially in scattering theory.

The given phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ = 55°, δ₃ = 30°, and δ₄ = 13°. Oh wait, and the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. So I guess I only need to consider these five terms.

Wait, right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a partial wave expansion. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ] P_l(cosθ) ), where k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since the question asks specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ = 0°. Oh, right, because the incident beam direction is along the initial velocity direction, so θ=0.

At θ=0°, the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) — because cos(0) is 1. P_l(1) is equal to 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1. That simplifies things. So the expression for f(θ=0) becomes (1/k) Σ [ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ].

But wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

Let me think about how to compute this. Each term in the sum contributes to the imaginary part. The term (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l can be written as (2l+1) [cos δ_l + i sin δ_l] sin δ_l. So when expanded, the imaginary part of each term is (2l +1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Wait, no, let me double-check that. So e^{iδ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So e^{iδ} * sin
