Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this involves relativistic mechanics because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus X is. The question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, the isotope is Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6, meaning it's a lithium-6 nucleus.

Now, I need to calculate the energy of each nucleus in the collider. I think the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the equation.

Let me compute gamma first. Let me compute (v/c)²: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784)… wait, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3, so sqrt(0.0784) must be around 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, 0.28 * 3.5714 equals? Let's see: 0.28 *3=0.84, 0.28*0.5714≈0.16, so total about 1. So that's correct.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c² each. Since Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the rest mass energy m0 c² is 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. The mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6 times the mass of a nucleon because of binding energy. Oh right, the rest mass of the nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of the mass defect (binding energy). But wait, in this problem, since we're dealing with the rest mass of the nucleus, do I need to calculate it more accurately?

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps the question expects us to approximate the mass as 6 nucleon masses. I'm not entirely sure, but maybe that's the way to go. Let me think: the mass of Li-6 is roughly 6 * 938 MeV/c² minus some binding energy, but since the problem doesn't provide specific data, perhaps we are to use the approximation. So I'll proceed with m0 c² = 6 * 938 MeV = 5.628 GeV.

So the energy E is gamma multiplied by m0 c². E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV. Let me compute that.

First, calculate 5.628 * 3.5714. Let's see:

5 *3.5714 is 17.857.
0.628 *3.5714 is approximately 2.24, because 0.6*3.57 is about 2.142, and 0.028*3.57≈0.100. So total about 2.242. Adding to 17.857 gives around 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait: 5.628 *3.5714.

Let me compute it more accurately.

3.5714 is approximately 3.57142857 (since 1/0.28 is exactly 3.57142857...).

So 5.628 * 3.57142857:

Let me break it down:

5 *3.57142857 = 17.85714285

0.628 *3.5714285
