Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has been characterized using FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. In the 1H NMR, there are several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. Also, some specific splitting patterns are observed: a doublet of triplets of quartets and another as a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the IR data. A broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates an -OH group because O-H stretches are broad. The peak at 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1, which fits the first peak. Also, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm^-1. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the options, all of them except maybe some have a COOH group. Let me check:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Yes, ends with COOH.
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. Ends with COOH.
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. COOH again.
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. COOH as well.

So all are carboxylic acids. That makes sense with the IR data.

Next, the NMR data. The key points are that there are no vinyl (CH2=CH-) hydrogens, so the molecule doesn't have double bonds. All the options seem to be alkanes with a COOH group, so no double bonds. So that's fine.

In the NMR, there are different splitting patterns: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Let's think about what that could mean.

The splitting patterns arise from neighboring hydrogens. Each split is due to coupling with adjacent Hs. The more neighboring Hs, the more splits. For example, a triplet comes from coupling with two equivalent Hs.

So a quartet (four peaks) would be from coupling with three equivalent Hs. But wait, in splitting, the number of peaks is n+1, where n is the number of neighboring Hs.

Wait, but a doublet of triplets of quartets... Let me parse that. Let's take it step by step. Let's say a signal is a doublet (meaning first split into two by one neighboring group), then each of those is split into triplets (so each part is now three), and each triplet is split into quartets (each part becomes four). So the total splitting would be 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 peaks, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is sequential. Alternatively, perhaps each level of splitting is due to different neighboring groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of triplets of quartets because each of the initial Hs is coupling with two different sets of Hs. Like, for example, a CH2 group next to a CH group which is next to another CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler. Let's look at the structures of the options and see which one would give such splitting.

Looking at each option:

Option D: CH3
