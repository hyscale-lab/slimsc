Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down. The question involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So the starting material probably has a ketone group.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which is usually indicative of an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, I should consider other possibilities. Oh, maybe it's an aldehyde or a ketone's C=O? No, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. So that's a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a bit low for a ketone, more like esters or aldehydes. Wait, no, actually, ketones can vary. Let me think: carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, broad. So in the IR, the 3400-2500 might be O-H, but also possibly an alcohol or an acid. But the 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe a ketone or an ester.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a sharp singlet or a broad singlet. That region is typically for aldehydic protons or for carboxylic acid protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But a carboxylic acid would also have a proton around 10-12, but that's usually a broad peak because of the exchange with water. The integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde. Or maybe a phenolic OH, but that's usually downfield but not as much as 10.5. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like a ketone next to an electronegative group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Let me go through each NMR peak:
