Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it again and try to understand what's going on. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Oh, and the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's the peak wavelength for a black body, which depends on temperature.

Then, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. But how does that affect the problem? Oh, wait, maybe it's about Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving, the observed wavelength changes due to Doppler effect. But in the problem, it says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is already accounted for, or maybe not. Hmm, I'm a bit confused there.

The question is about the luminosity. The astronomers computed that Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's by a certain factor. Both stars are considered as black bodies. So I need to compute the luminosity ratio using black body radiation formulas.

I remember that the luminosity of a star (a black body) depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the luminosity is proportional to R² T⁴.

Wait, but what's T here? Because the peak wavelength is the same for both stars as observed. Oh wait, but if the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths would be shifted. So the observed peak wavelength is the same, but the actual emitted peak might be different.

Wait, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719 ×10^-3 m·K). So if the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures would be the same only if there's no Doppler shift. But if one is moving, we have
