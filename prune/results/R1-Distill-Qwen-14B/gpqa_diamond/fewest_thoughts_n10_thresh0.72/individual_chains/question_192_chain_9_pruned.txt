Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the electric field at a point outside a conducting sphere with a cavity. Hmm, let's see. Alright, let me start by reading the problem carefully.

So, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and it's not at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. Oh, right, and s must be less than R because r < R. 

Inside this cavity, someone placed a small positive charge +q. Now, the question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions for E.

Alright, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with conductors, the charges redistribute themselves based on the situation. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, when we place a charge inside the cavity, things change. 

Wait, when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have an induced charge equal to the original charge if the conductor was neutral to begin with. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge remains zero. So, the inner surface of the conductor (inside the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor's material's charges rearrange to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. Then, the outer surface will have a charge of +q to balance, so the total conductor's charge remains zero.

But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q. That makes the total conductor's charge zero, matching the initial condition.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so at a distance L from the conductor's center. Wait, but the conductor's radius is R, so P is outside since L > R.

What's the electric field outside a charged conductor? I remember that for a spherically symmetric charge distribution, the electric field outside is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, if the conductor has a charge Q, the field outside would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q)/(r²), where r is the distance from the center.

But in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So, the field at P should be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Because the field outside depends only on the total enclosed charge within the Gaussian surface, which in this case is the outer surface charge.

Wait, but wait. The charge is placed inside the cavity, but the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So from the outside, the conductor behaves as if all the
