Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember SMEFT is like an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. But wait, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is built from operators that are Lorentz-invariant because the Standard Model (SM) is Lorentz symmetric. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory, it's built in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. So operators should be Poincare-invariant. But wait, some sources I remember say that in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that the theory is Poincare invariant. So 2 is also a must. So options that include both 1 and 2 are possible.

Wait, but wait. Are all SMEFT operators Poincare-symmetric? Because the operators are constructed as Lorentz scalars and the field theory is in a Poincare-invariant spacetime. So yes, I think 2 is correct. So the question is whether 2 must be respected by all operators.

But then, what about 3, CP symmetry? Does SMEFT require operators to respect CP? I believe the SMEFT framework doesn't necessarily enforce CP symmetry. Because in the Standard Model, some operators (like the CKM matrix) violate CP, so SMEFT allows for CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning they don't have to respect it. So 3 is not a must-respected symmetry. So any option that includes 3 is incorrect.

Now, 4 is CPT symmetry. CPT is a big symmetry because it's a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. In the SM, CPT is respected, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from the SM. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory might not be unitary or could lead to inconsistencies. So 4 is a must.

Putting it all together, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused about Poincare symmetry. Because Poincare includes translations, and operators in SMEFT are constructed with fields, so their products would be translationally invariant. So yes, Poincare is respected.

So which options include 1,2, and 4? Looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2
B)3,4
C)1,2,4
D)1,3,4

Oh, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed with operators that respect certain symmetries. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are Lorentz-invariant because the Standard Model (SM), from which SMEFT is derived, is Lorentz symmetric. Thus, Lorentz symmetry must be respected.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory formulated in a Poincaré-invariant spacetime, all operators in SMEFT respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry is not necessarily respected by all SMEFT operators. The SM already allows for CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT inherits this feature. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, and SMEFT respects it because it is derived from the SM, which also respects CPT symmetry. Any violation of CPT symmetry would lead to inconsistencies or a lack of unitarity, so CPT symmetry must be preserved.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**C) 1, 2, 4**

Answer: C
