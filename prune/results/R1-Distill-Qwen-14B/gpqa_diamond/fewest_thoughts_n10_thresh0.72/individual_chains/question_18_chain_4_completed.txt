Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I'm not sure if the mass matters here, since the question is about elemental abundances. Maybe it's just extra info.

The abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh wait, those are logarithmic scales. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundance compared to the Sun. So, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H star / Fe/H sun), right?

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, nFe and nH are number densities? So, for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12? That can't be right. Wait, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH_sun =10^(-5).

I think what the problem is asking is the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find [Si/Star1] / [Si/Star2] or something like that? Or perhaps (nSi in Star_1)/(nSi in Star_2) ?

Wait, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [nSi1 / nSi2]?

But to find that, I probably need to find the Si abundance in each star relative to H, then take the ratio.

Wait, the given data includes [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3, meaning Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that in the Sun. But wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H in Star_1 is same as Sun. So, [Fe/H]_1 = log( (Fe1/H1)/(Fe_sun/H_sun) ) =0 → (Fe1/H1) = (Fe_sun/H_sun).

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg2/H2 = Mg_sun/H_sun.

Wait, but for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0, so Fe abundance is same as Sun. And [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → [Si/Fe] = log(Si1/Fe1) - log(Si_sun/Fe_sun) = 0.3 → (Si1/Fe1) = (Si_sun/Fe_sun) *10^0.3.

But since Fe1/Fe_sun =1 (because [Fe/H]_1=0), then Si1/Si_sun = (Si1/Fe1) * (Fe_sun/Si_sun) ) ?

Wait, let's think step by step.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe1/Fe_sun = 1 → Fe1 = Fe_sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (Si1 / Fe1) = 10^0.3 * (Si_sun / Fe_sun).

Since Fe1 = Fe_sun, Si1 = 10^0.3 * (Si_sun / Fe_sun) * Fe1.

But Fe1 is same as Fe_sun, so Si1 = 10^0.3 * Si_sun.

Wait, no, because (Si1/Fe1) = 10^0.3 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun). So Si1 = Fe1 * [10^0.3 * (Si_sun/Fe_sun)].

But Fe1 is same as Fe_sun, so Si1 = 10^0.3 * Si_sun.

So Si1/Si_sun =10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (Mg2/Si2) =10^0.3 * (Mg_sun/Si_sun).

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → Mg2/Mg_sun = (H2/H_sun) → Mg2 = Mg_sun * (H2/H_sun).

Wait, but I need to find Si2 in terms of Si_sun.

Wait, from [Mg/Si]_2=0.3:

Mg2/Si2 = 10^0.3 * (Mg_sun/Si_sun) → Si2 = Mg2/(10^0.3 * Mg_sun/Si_sun).

But Mg2 = Mg_sun*(H2/H_sun) → because [Mg/H]_2=0, so Mg2 = Mg_sun * (H2/H_sun).

So substitute that into Si2:

Si2 = [ Mg_sun * (H2/H_sun) ] / [10^0.3 * (Mg_sun/Si_sun) ) ]

Simplify:

Mg_sun cancels:

= (H2/H_sun) / (10^0.3) * (Si_sun) )

= (H2/H_sun) * (Si_sun) /10^0.3.

Wait, but H2 and H_sun: their ratio is H2/H_sun = (H2/H_sun) → but what's H2 in Star_2? Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, but for Star_2, [Fe/H] isn't given, only [Mg/H] is given. So I'm not sure if H is the same as Star_1.

Wait, no, each star has their own H. So for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0. So Mg2/Mg_sun = H2/H_sun → so the Mg in Star_2 is same as the Sun when scaled by H.

But how does that affect Si2?

Wait, the photospheric composition of the Sun is given, so for the Sun, nFe/nH is known, as is nMg/nH.

But for the stars, their abundances are given relative to Fe or H. So perhaps each star's H is the same as the Sun's H? Or no, because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) in the star relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then Fe1/Fe_sun = H1/H_sun.

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] is defined as log( (Fe1/H1) / (Fe_sun/H_sun) ) = 0 → (Fe1/H1) = (Fe_sun/H_sun) → Fe1 = Fe_sun * (H1/H_sun).

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of number densities.

Let me denote the number density of an element X in the Sun as n_X^sun, and in the star as n_X.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe1 / n_H1 ) - log(n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) ) =0 → n_Fe1 /n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

So n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun) * n_H1. → but if I'm looking at ratios, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of the Sun's values.

Wait, but perhaps all the stars have the same H as the Sun? No, because [Fe/H] is the log of (Fe/H) in star over that in Sun. So if [Fe/H] is zero, Fe in star has same abundance as Sun relative to H.

But to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2, perhaps I can express each star's silicon abundance relative to the Sun, then take the ratio.

So let's proceed.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) / (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) ) )=0.3 → (n_Si1 /n_Fe1 ) =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun )

But [Fe/H]_1=0 → (n_Fe1 / n_H1) = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

So n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) * n_Fe1.

Substituting n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1,

n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) * (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1 )

Simplify: n_Si_sun, n_Fe_sun cancels.

So n_Si1 = 10^0.3 * (n_H1 /n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun.

Wait, but what is n_H1 relative to n_H_sun? Hmm, since [Fe/H]_1=0, n_Fe1 =n_Fe_sun*(n_H1 /n_H_sun ). So if I have n_H1 = x *n_H_sun, then n_Fe1 is n_Fe_sun * x.

But without additional info, perhaps the H in Star_1 is same as Sun's? Or not?

Wait, maybe all stars have the same H as the Sun? I don't think that's necessarily the case. Because the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2, which are the logarithms of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to proceed is to assume that the H in each star is the same as the Sun, but that might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach.

We can express the abundance of each element in the stars relative to H, because that's what the [X/H] notation gives.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1=0 → log(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H1.

But I don't know n_H1. So perhaps I can relate n_Si1 in terms of n_Si_sun.

From [Si/Fe]_1=0.3:

log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun )

Which is:

n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun )

But n_Fe1= (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun)*n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 = (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun ) * n_Fe1

= 10^0.3 * n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun * (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H1

= 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun / n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

So,

n_Si1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) * n_H1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2 ) = 0.3 + log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun )

→ n_Mg2/n_Si2 =10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun )

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → log(n_Mg2/n_H2 ) = log(n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun )

→ n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun )

So from the first equation for Star_2:

n_Si2 = n_Mg2/(10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ))

Substitute n_Mg2:

n_Si2 = [ n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun ) ] / [10^0.3 * (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) ]

Simplify:

n_Si2 = (n_H2/n_H_sun ) * (n_Si_sun) / 10^0.3.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_H2/n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun / 10^0.3.

Now, the problem is to find the ratio (n_Si1 /n_Si2 ).

So,

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *n_H1 ] / [ (n_H2/n_H_sun ) *n_Si_sun / 10^0.3 ]

Simplify:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (10^0.3 * n_Si_sun/n_H_sun *n_H1 ) * (n_H_sun / (n_H2 *n_Si_sun )) * 10^0.3 )

Wait, no, let me compute numerator divided by denominator.

Numerator: 10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H1.

Denominator: (n_H2/n_H_sun ) * n_Si_sun / (10^0.3 )

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H1 ] / [ (n_H2/n_H_sun ) *n_Si_sun /10^0.3 ]

= [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun) *n_H1 ] * [10^0.3 * n_H_sun / (n_H2 *n_Si_sun ) ]

n_Si_sun cancels, n_H_sun cancels.

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (n_H1) / n_H2

= 10^(0.6) * (n_H1 / n_H2 )

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of n_H1 and n_H2. Wait, maybe each star's H is the same as the Sun's? Because [Fe/H]_1=0 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, let's think about that.

In Star_1: [Fe/H]_1=0 → (n_Fe1/n_H1) = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun )

So n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

But if n_H1 =n_H_sun, then n_Fe1 =n_Fe_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun )

If n_H2 =n_H_sun, then n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun.

But in the Sun, n_H is known. So if each star has the same H as the Sun, then n_H1 =n_H2 =n_H_sun.

In that case, n_H1 /n_H2 =1.

Thus, n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^0.6.

10^0.6 is approximately 3.98, right? Because 10^0.6 = e^(0.6 ln10) ≈ e^(1.3816) ≈ 3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm assuming that n_H1 =n_H2 =n_H_sun. Is that a valid assumption?

Wait, the problem says "using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances". So perhaps the H is measured as part of the process, and each star's H is used as the reference.

But then, [Fe/H]_1=0 would mean that the abundance of Fe in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun relative to their own H.

So perhaps n_H1 is not equal to n_H_sun. So I can't make that assumption.

Hmm, that complicates things. Because if the H in each star varies, then unless I know their ratio, I can't compute the final n_Si1/n_Si2.

But wait, the problem gives the Sun's nFe/nH and nMg/nH. So maybe the H in each star is the same as the Sun's. Because otherwise, how else would the [X/H] work?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in the stars is the same as the Sun. Or perhaps it's not needed because it cancels out.

Wait, let me go back to the expression:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = 10^0.6 * (n_H1/n_H2 )

But without knowing n_H1/n_H2, I can't compute this ratio. So perhaps there's something I'm missing.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I should think about the abundances in terms of the Sun's.

Wait, the problem gives the Sun's photospheric composition as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, which gives log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

Similarly, for Mg: log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So for the Sun, nFe/nH =1e-4.5, and nMg/nH=1e-5.

In Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe1/nH1 =nFe_sun /nH_sun =1e-4.5.

So, nFe1 =1e-4.5 *nH1.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1 / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun )) ) =0.3 → (nSi1/nFe1 )=10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

From the Sun, nSi_sun = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *nFe_sun.

So, substituting nFe1 =1e-4.5 *nH1,

nSi1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * nFe1

=10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * (1e-4.5 *nH1 )

But since nSi_sun = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *nFe_sun,

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's compute the ratio (nSi1/nSi_sun ) and (nSi2/nSi_sun ), then take their ratio.

For Star_1:

nSi1/nFe1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

nFe1 =1e-4.5 *nH1 (since [Fe/H]_1=0)

nSi1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * nFe1

=10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) * 1e-4.5 *nH1.

But nSi_sun = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *nFe_sun.

So,

nSi1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun ) * 1e-4.5 *nH1 /nFe_sun *nFe_sun? Wait, no. Wait, (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) is a constant. Let me compute it.

From the Sun's data:

nFe_sun/nH_sun =1e-4.5 → nFe_sun =1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5 →nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

But what about nSi_sun? Hmm, the Sun's photospheric composition for silicon isn't given. So perhaps I can express everything using the given ratios.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of nH.

Let me proceed.

For Star_1:

nFe1 =1e-4.5 *nH1.

nSi1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) *nFe1.

But nFe_sun =1e-4.5 *nH_sun.

So (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) = (nSi_sun / (1e-4.5 *nH_sun )).

But without knowing nSi_sun, I can't compute this. Hmm, this is getting tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in each star relative to the Sun's Si.

But without the Sun's Si, I can't proceed. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the ratio of silicon relative to hydrogen, but no, the question is the ratio between the two stars.

Ah, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about how to find the ratio of Si in Star_1 to Si in Star_2.

We need (nSi1 /nSi2) = ?

But from earlier steps, I have:

nSi1 =10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

nSi2 = (n_H2/n_H_sun ) *n_Si_sun/(10^0.3 )

So the ratio is:

nSi1/nSi2 = [10^0.3 * (n_Si_sun/n_H_sun ) *n_H1 ] / [ (n_H2/n_H_sun ) *n_Si_sun/(10^0.3 ) ]

Simplify:

= (10^0.3 * 10^0.3 ) * (n_H1 )/(n_H2 )

= 10^0.6 * (n_H1 /n_H2 )

But again, I don't have n_H1 and n_H2. However, perhaps the H is the same in both stars? Because [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2 are given as zero, which would imply that their H is the same as the Sun's.

Wait, let me think about that.

If Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, that means (Fe1/H1) = (Fe_sun /H_sun).

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0 → (Mg2/H2) = (Mg_sun/H_sun).

But the problem is, without knowing whether H1 and H2 are same as H_sun, I can't compute n_H1 and n_H2.

Wait, but perhaps the H in the stars is the same as in the Sun. Then, n_H1 =n_H2 =n_H_sun.

In that case, n_H1/n_H2 =1.

So, (nSi1/nSi2) =10^0.6 =approx 3.98.

Which is option A.

But I'm not entirely sure if H is same in both stars. But given the information and the way the problem is set up, perhaps this is the intended approach.

So the answer should be approximately 3.9, which is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → Silicon abundance relative to Fe in Star_1 is \(10^{0.3}\) times that in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → Magnesium abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → Magnesium abundance relative to silicon in Star_2 is \(10^{0.3}\) times that in the Sun.

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \implies n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5}\).
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \implies n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5}\).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \(n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} = 10^{-4.5}\).
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, \(n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Si, sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, sun}})\).
- Substituting \(n_{\text{Fe,1}} = 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}\), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}\right) \cdot \left(10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}\right).
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{H, sun}} = 10^{-5}\).
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, \(n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{Si,2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}})\).
- Substituting \(n_{\text{Mg,2}} = 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}\), we get:
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}})}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \left(\frac{n_{\text{Si, sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe, sun}}}\right) \cdot \left(10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}\right)}{\frac{10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}{10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{Mg, sun}}/n_{\text{Si, sun}})}}.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]

#### Assumption:
Since the problem does not provide explicit values for \(n_{\text{H,1}}\) and \(n_{\text{H,2}}\), we assume that the hydrogen density in both stars is the same as in the Sun (\(n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{H, sun}}\)). This simplifies the ratio to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**
