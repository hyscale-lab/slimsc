Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. Let's see, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. And it's reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in a reaction called the hydroiodination or maybe a dehydrohalogenation? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have a dienophile and HI with red phosphorus, it could be a dihydroxylation, but wait, no, wait. Or perhaps it's about adding across double bonds.

Wait, another thought: I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups. Oh, wait, no, the Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 and heat, I think. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that doesn't fit here. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene), so there's a double bond. Also, there's a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) at position 5. So the molecule is a substituted cyclohexene with some substituents.

The reaction is with excess HI and red phosphorus. I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, like in the addition of H and X across the double bond. Wait, but more specifically, in the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps the reaction is a hydration or a halogenation. Alternatively, wait, for alkenes reacting with HI, it's an acid-catalyzed addition. But when red phosphorus is involved, maybe it's a different mechanism. Oh wait! I think this is about the addition of HI to the double bond. But wait, in a conjugated diene maybe?

Wait, but the molecule is cyclohex-3-ene, so that's a six-membered ring with a double bond. So the starting molecule is a cyclohexene with substituents at positions 2 and 5. Let's try to imagine the structure. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. At position 2 is the formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is a vinyl group, which is CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-.

Wait, the structure would be cyclohexene with substituents: at C2 is a formyl group, and at C5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), but more correctly, vinyl is CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene-carboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene part is the ring with double bond at 3-ene, and substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH2CH2 but as a vinyl group, so CH2=CH-).

So now, the reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI. What happens when alkenes react with HI? Well, usually, HI adds across double bonds. But the presence of red phosphorus makes me think of a different reaction. Oh wait, I think that when alkenes react with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's a halogenation where the double bond is replaced by two vicinal diiodides. Wait, no, that's when you have a diiodide addition. Or perhaps the red phosphorus is acting as a catalyst for something else.

Wait, perhaps it's the hydroiodination where the double bond is hydrogenated with addition of iodide. But wait, HI is H-I, so when it adds across the double bond, the H would add to one carbon and I to the other. But with excess HI, maybe it's a complete addition, but in what way?

Wait, but another thought: red phosphorus is used in the reaction where it acts as a reducing agent. For example, the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat, but that's not this case. Alternatively, the Wolff-Kishner is for removing carbonyl groups, but that requires hydrazine and heat, so not applicable here.

Wait, another angle: the starting material has a cyclohexene ring, so it's a conjugated system. The substituents are formyl and vinyl. Wait, the formyl group is a carbonyl, and the vinyl group is another double bond. So the molecule has two double bonds: the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group. So the index of hydrogen deficiency in the starting material would be 2 (one from the ring, another from the vinyl group), but perhaps the formyl group doesn't add to that because it's a single carbonyl.

Wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is halogens and N is nitrogens. But in the starting material, perhaps the calculation is:

The molecular formula would be C8H6O3 (but let me double-check). Let's see: the cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons. Then, substituents: formyl is CHO (one C, one O), and vinyl is CH2CH2 (but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached, so that's another two carbons). Wait, maybe I should count all the carbons.

Wait, the formula of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break it down:

- Cyclohexene (6 carbons), but with substituents at positions 2 and 5.

At position 2: formyl group (CHO) adds one C, one O.

At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds two C.

And the carboxylic acid group is at position... wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Because in cyclohexane carboxylic acid, the COOH is at position 1. So:

Total carbons: 6 (cyclohexene) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 10 carbons?

Wait, wait. Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond (so 6 C). The substituents:

- Position 2: CHO (1 C)
- Position 5: CH2CH2 (vinyl, which is CH2=CH- as a substituent, so that's 2 C)
- Position 1: COOH (another 1 C for the COOH group, but that's part of the ring, right? No, wait, the ring has 6 C, and COOH is a substituent. So the total C would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 10 C.

Hydrogens: Let's see, the ring is cyclohexene. So without substituents, it's C6H10. But with substituents, each substituent will take away H.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the formula. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, formula would be C10H8O3.

Because:

- Cyclohexene (C6H10)
- Adding a formyl group (CHO) adds 1 C, 1 O, and no H (since it's replacing a H on the ring)
- Adding a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but as a substituent, which is actually CH2=CH- substituent, so that's (CH2CH2-) but with a double bond. So each substituent reduces H by 1 for the ring's CH2 group.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to count each substituent's impact. But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the index of hydrogen deficiency.

Original molecule (starting material): It has a cyclohexene ring (1 double bond), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a formyl group (a carbonyl, which is a double bond). So that's three double bonds, so three degrees of hydrogen deficiency. But wait, the formyl group is part of the substituent, so it's a carbonyl. So the starting material has three double bonds, which gives an index of (3).

Wait, but wait: the index of hydrogen deficiency is the sum of double bonds and rings. So for the starting molecule, it's a cyclohexene (1 ring, 1 double bond?), wait no, rings count as double bonds. So a cyclohexene has a ring (count as 1) and a double bond (another 1?), but wait no, a cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the ring is a ring, which is a form of a double bond. So the cyclohexene contributes one double bond equivalent. The vinyl group is another double bond (CH2=CH-), and the formyl group is a carbonyl (another double bond). So total of three double bonds, so index is 3.

But the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So what happens to the double bonds?

Red phosphorus and HI: I think the reaction is the addition of HI across the double bonds. But wait, which double bonds are present?

First, the cyclohexene (3-ene) is a ring double bond. The vinyl group is another double bond (so substituent). The formyl group is a carbonyl. So in the starting material, we have three double bonds: one in the ring, one in the vinyl group, and one in the formyl group.

But wait, the formyl group is a carbonyl, so it's a double bond. So the starting material has three double bonds.

But the reaction is with HI and red phosphorus. Now, HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. In the presence of red phosphorus, I think it's used for the addition of HI across the double bonds, perhaps in a way that adds H and I across each double bond.

Wait, but wait. If the reaction is adding HI across each double bond, then each double bond would become single bonds, adding H and I.

But wait, red phosphorus in this context might be part of the mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the addition of HI to each double bond.

So, the starting material has three double bonds. Reacting with excess HI and red phosphorus would presumably add HI across each. Let's think about the product.

The product after reaction would have each double bond (from the starting material) turned into single bonds with the addition of HI.

So, the cyclohexene would become cyclohexane (with a substituent), the vinyl group would become CH2CH2 (but wait, adding HI would add across the double bond, making it CH2-CH2-I? No, wait, when HI adds to a double bond, it's H adding to one end and I to the other. So for each double bond, adding HI would produce a vicinal diiodide. Wait, no, in the case of adding HI to a double bond, it would be a halogenation, adding H and I across the double bond. So, for each double bond, one H and one I would add.

Wait, but the starting material has three double bonds: the ring (cyclohexene), the vinyl group (CH2=CH-), and the formyl group (CHO). So, each of these would react with HI.

But wait, the formyl group is a carbonyl (C=O). How does HI react with that? Maybe it would add across the carbonyl, but adding H and I. Wait, but adding HI to a carbonyl would form an alcohol iodide, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group would undergo some kind of reduction.

Wait, another approach: red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but that's a different reaction. Alternatively, in the presence of red phosphorus, HI could act as a reducing agent. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a cleavage of the double bonds. Red phosphorus can sometimes cause the cleavage of double bonds, but I'm not certain about the specifics.

Wait, perhaps I should think about all the possible double bonds and how each would react. Let's list them:

1. The cyclohexene ring (C3-C4 double bond): when HI adds, it will add H to C3 and I to C4, or vice versa. This would create a vicinal diiodide.

2. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-): when HI adds, it becomes CH2-I and CH2-H. Or perhaps CH2-I and CH2-CH2 with an iodide? Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-. Adding HI would give CH2-I-CH2? No, wait, when HI adds to a double bond, the H adds to one end and I to the other. So the vinyl group would become CH2-CH2-I, but that can't be right, because the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. So after addition, it would be CH2-I-CH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2-CH2, but with substituents. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps another approach: after reaction with HI, each double bond (including the formyl group) would be saturated. But wait, the formyl group is a carbonyl; adding HI across it would make it CH2O-I, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group would be reduced to a CH2 group, but that might require a different condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) would undergo a reaction. Adding HI to a carbonyl group would not be straightforward. Maybe the formyl group is more reactive, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the cleavage of the double bonds. Red phosphorus can catalyze the cleavage of double bonds to form carbocations, which then react with HI. But that's more in the case of diiodination. Alternatively, in the presence of red phosphorus, the double bonds might undergo iodination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of the double bonds. But red phosphorus is more about addition reactions.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, but no, that's for ketones and inserting an oxygen.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and excess HI. I think this is about the addition of HI to each double bond, including the cyclohexene ring and the vinyl group, but not the formyl group. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is a carbonyl and doesn't react under these conditions.

Wait, but in the presence of HI, the formyl group might undergo some addition. Let me think: carbonyl groups can undergo nucleophilic addition. HI is a strong acid and a source of iodide ions. So perhaps the formyl group's carbonyl would react with HI, adding an iodide. But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group remains unchanged, and only the other double bonds react.

Let me recount the possible double bonds in the starting material:

1. The cyclohexene ring (1 double bond).
2. The vinyl group (another double bond).
3. The formyl group (a carbonyl, but that's a double bond as well).

So three double bonds. The reaction with HI and red phosphorus would add HI across each, converting each double bond into single bonds with addition of H and I.

If each of the three double bonds reacts, then each would be converted into a single bond, and the index of hydrogen deficiency would be zero because all rings and double bonds are gone.

Wait, but let's think about each:

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond would become a single bond (so the ring becomes cyclohexane).
- The vinyl group's double bond would become a single bond (so CH2=CH- becomes CH2-CH2, but with iodine added? So maybe CH2-I and CH2-I? No, maybe each double bond becomes a single bond with H and I added on adjacent carbons.

Wait, each addition of HI to a double bond would convert a double bond (which is one degree of unsaturation) into a single bond, thus reducing the index by one for each double bond treated.

So, if all three double bonds are saturated, the index would go from 3 (original) to 0 (product).

So the product would have no double bonds or rings, so the index of hydrogen deficiency would be zero.

Wait, but wait. The formyl group is a carbonyl, which is a double bond. Adding HI to a carbonyl would lead to a dihydroxy compound? Or perhaps the carbonyl would be converted into an alcohol or something else. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group isn't reactive under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is a nitrile? No, no, it's a formyl group, which is a CHO group.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The starting material has three double bonds: the ring, the vinyl, and the formyl. The reaction adds HI across each, breaking each double bond into a single bond, adding H and I. So after the reaction, all three double bonds are gone, meaning the product has no rings or double bonds. So the index of hydrogen deficiency is zero.

But wait, what about the formyl group? HI might not react with the formyl group. Let me think about the reactivity. The carbonyl is more reactive than the alkenes? I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe the more substituted double bonds react first.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is more electron-deficient and reacts faster. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the formyl group doesn't react because it's a carbonyl and not an alkene. So the reactions would only occur on the cyclohexene and the vinyl group, which are alkenes.

So, if the starting material has two double bonds (the cyclohexene and the vinyl group), each adding HI would saturate them. The formyl group remains as a carbonyl. So in the product, the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, the vinyl becomes CH2CH2 with I added, and the formyl remains as a carbonyl.

So the product would have no rings (the cyclohexane is a single bond ring) and the formyl group as a double bond.

So the index of hydrogen deficiency would be 1, due to the formyl group.

Wait, but wait: the starting material has three double bonds (if formyl is included), but maybe the reaction doesn't affect the formyl group. So the product would have one double bond (formyl), so index 1.

But then, the options are A) 1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

So, if the product has one double bond, the answer is A) 1.

But wait, perhaps the formyl group also reacts. If the formyl group's carbonyl is attacked by HI, adding HI across the carbonyl, turning it into a single bond with two substituents. But how would that work? Adding H and I across the carbonyl would give a CH2OI structure? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is reduced.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the formyl group undergoes a reduction. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Wait, I think that when carbonyl groups are treated with red phosphorus and HI, they can be reduced. For example, ketones can be reduced to secondary alcohols, and aldehydes to primary alcohols. So if the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH, then the carbonyl becomes a single bond, reducing the index of hydrogen deficiency.

Wait, but in that case, the formyl group's double bond (C=O) is converted into a single bond (C-O), so the index would decrease by one.

So, if all three double bonds (cyclohexene, vinyl, formyl) are saturated, then the product would have zero index.

But wait, I'm not certain about whether the formyl group would react under these conditions. Because the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong acid. So perhaps the formyl group would be protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, and then react with HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group doesn't react because it's less reactive than the alkenes. In that case, only the cyclohexene and vinyl groups would add HI, leaving the formyl as a carbonyl.

So, the product would have the formyl group as a double bond, making the index of hydrogen deficiency 1.

But wait, wait a second. The starting material is a cyclohex-3-ene ring, which is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So the ring is a cyclohexene, which upon addition of HI would become a cyclohexane (no double bond), thus losing one degree of unsaturation. The vinyl group (another double bond) would become a single bond upon addition of HI, thus losing another degree. The formyl group (another double bond) would either stay or react.

If all three double bonds are consumed, the product would have none, index 0.

But if only two are consumed, index 1.

Alternatively, maybe the formyl group doesn't react, so the index would be 1.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI: this is a reaction I'm not entirely sure about. I think it's used for the addition of HI to alkenes, but perhaps it's also involved in the reduction of carbonyl groups.

Wait, I came across a reaction where aldehydes and ketones can be reduced by red phosphorus and iodine, but that's for the production of alcohols. But in this case, it's red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH (alcohol) when treated with red phosphorus and HI. Because red phosphorus and iodine can reduce carbonyl groups.

Wait, if the formyl group is CHO, reduction would give CH2OH. So the product would have an -OH group instead of CHO.

In that case, the formyl group's double bond (C=O) is converted into a single bond (C-O), thus reducing the index of hydrogen deficiency by one.

So, the starting material has three double bonds. The two alkenes (cyclohexene and vinyl) are each saturated by addition of HI, and the formyl group is reduced, converting its double bond into a single bond.

So, all three double bonds are gone, leading to an index of zero.

So the product would have no double bonds or rings, so the index is zero.

Therefore, the answer would be D) 0.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group doesn't react, so the index remains at 1.

Wait, but the question is about what happens when the starting material is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. So all possible double bonds would react.

Therefore, the product has no double bonds left, so the index is zero.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The starting material contains three double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring, one in the vinyl group, and one in the formyl group (as a carbonyl). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely results in the saturation of these double bonds.

1. **Cyclohexene Ring (C3-C4 double bond):** The double bond in the cyclohexene ring reacts with HI, converting it into a single bond. This reduces the index of hydrogen deficiency by 1.

2. **Vinyl Group (CH2=CH-):** The double bond in the vinyl group also reacts with HI, converting it into a single bond. This further reduces the index of hydrogen deficiency by 1.

3. **Formyl Group (C=O):** The carbonyl group in the formyl group can react with red phosphorus and HI. This reaction likely reduces the carbonyl group to an alcohol (-CH2OH), converting the double bond into a single bond. This reduces the index of hydrogen deficiency by 1.

Since all three double bonds are saturated in the product, the product contains no double bonds or rings, resulting in an index of hydrogen deficiency of 0.

**Critical Analysis of Options:**
- **A) 1:** Incorrect. This would imply that one double bond remains in the product, but all three double bonds are saturated.
- **B) 3:** Incorrect. This would imply no reaction occurred, which contradicts the reaction conditions.
- **C) 5:** Incorrect. This is unrelated to the structure of the starting material or the reaction.
- **D) 0:** Correct. All double bonds are saturated, leaving no degrees of unsaturation.

Answer: D
