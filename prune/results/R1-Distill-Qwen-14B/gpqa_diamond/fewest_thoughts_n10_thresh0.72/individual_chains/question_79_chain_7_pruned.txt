Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify which of the four options is compound X.

Wait, but wait. The question is about identifying compound X, which is the starting material. The reaction conditions involve 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I remember that this compound is commonly known as DBU, which stands for 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene. Oh wait, no, I think that's another one. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually DBU, which is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used as a base in various reactions, like in eliminations, because it's a good proton acceptor and doesn't get involved in the reaction itself.

So, the reaction is probably an elimination or an epoxide ring-opening? Wait, but the product's NMR is given. So, compound X is the starting material, and the product is the result of a reaction. Hmm.

Wait, the product's NMR is provided. So the question is about what the starting material must have been, such that upon reaction with DBU, we get the product with these NMR characteristics.

Wait, but what kind of reaction would DBU cause? Since DBU is a strong base, it's often used in elimination reactions, like E2 mechanisms. It can also induce epoxide ring-opening under certain conditions, but epoxide ring-opening usually requires a nucleophile, unless it's an acid-catalyzed process. Wait, but DBU is a base, so maybe it's abstracting protons in an elimination.

Looking at the options, all of them are epoxides. Wait, looking back: the options are A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane, C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, D) 2-styrylepoxide.

So all options are epoxide compounds (oxirane rings). So, the reaction is probably opening the epoxide ring. But wait, DBU is a base, so would it open an epoxide? Typically, epoxides can undergo ring-opening under acidic or basic conditions. Acidic conditions involve protonation, making the epoxide more electrophilic, then nucleophilic attack. Basic conditions usually require a strong base to deprotonate something, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination. Wait, but the starting material has an epoxide, and the product doesn't? Or perhaps the epoxide is opening. Let me think about the product's NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). Two singlets for 3H each. So, two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signal, probably because they're attached to a carbon that doesn't have neighboring protons. Maybe attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or as geminal groups.

Then, in the aromatic region:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). That looks like a coupling pattern for a para-substituted aromatic group, but wait, let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted styrene or something similar.

Wait, the 1H NMR has four signals in the aromatic region. Let's parse them:

- δ6.75 (1H, d)
- δ7.08 (2H, d)
- δ7.68 (1H, d)
- δ7.71 (2H, d)

If I think of a para-substituted benzene, the protons would typically be a singlet for the two equivalent protons, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substitution, but the coupling would be different.

Wait, another possibility is that the aromatic protons are part of a conjugated system, like a styryl group (CH2=CHPh). Let's think about the splitting. Perhaps it's a trans coupling.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

The carbons are at δ21.3 and 28.4, both singlets, so two different methyl groups. Then, several carbons in the aromatic region: 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C), 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C), and a carbonyl at 197.7 (probably a ketone, but wait, in the product, could that be an ester or something else? Or maybe a carbonyl from an epoxide opening?)

Wait, but the starting material is an epoxide, and the product's NMR shows a carbonyl. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the product and the starting material.

Wait,
