Okay, so I'm trying to solve this enthalpy of formation problem. Hmm, let me think about what I know. Enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Oh right, the formula involves the bond energies of the reactants and products.

Wait, the molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a pretty complex structure. Let me count the number of each type of bond in this molecule.

First, I need to find the number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. Also, since H-H isn't part of the product, maybe I don't need that unless it's involved in the formation process.

Wait, the question gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, atomization is the energy required to break a molecule into its atoms. So for each carbon atom in the molecule, it would require 1000 kJ to atomize it. But how does that fit into the enthalpy of formation?

Oh, right, the enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is zero. So when calculating the formation, we consider the elements as they are. Carbon is in its standard state as graphite, I think. But for the purpose of this calculation, maybe we're using the atomization energy as a part of the bond energies.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline the steps again.
