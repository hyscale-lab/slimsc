Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, wait. Oh wait, column matrices are usually written vertically. So the state vector is [-1; 2; 1]. 

Then, there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by a square matrix. The matrix for P has specific elements. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P's matrix is:

[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2 ]
[ 0, 1/√2, 0 ]

And the matrix for Q is:
[1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, -1]

So Q's matrix is diagonal, with diagonal elements 1, 0, -1. Interesting.

The question is about measuring P first and then Q. We need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the question says: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So P is measured first, then Q. So the order is P then Q.

But wait, no, no. The way it's phrased, it's someone measuring Q just after measuring P. So first P is measured, then Q. So the events are in the order P, then Q.

We need the probability that P gives 0 and Q gives -1.

I think the way to approach this is to first find the state of the system after the first measurement of P, which will be the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of P. Then, using this new state, find the probability of measuring Q as -1.

Wait, but first, let me think about the possible eigenvalues of P. Maybe that could help.

So P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me try to find its eigenvalues. Or perhaps, since the matrix is given, maybe it's easier to compute the possible outcomes for P and their corresponding eigenvectors.

Wait, but maybe I can find the eigenvalues. Let me try to compute the characteristic equation of P.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2:1/√2,0,1/√2
Row 3:0,1/√2,0

So the characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me compute this determinant.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2]
[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

So the determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, maybe expanding the determinant would take some time. Alternatively, perhaps P is a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and its eigenvalues are real.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that P is a 3x3 matrix with a particular structure. Let me think about the possible eigenvalues.

Wait, maybe P has 0 as an eigenvalue. Let me check that. To see if 0 is an eigenvalue, I can check if det(P) is zero, but perhaps it's easier to see if there's a non-trivial solution to P v = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the trace of P. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. The diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is 0. That means the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. So if I can find the eigenvalues, they must sum to zero.

Hmm, but maybe a better approach is to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of P.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues of P more efficiently. Let me try expanding the determinant.

The determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0.

Wait, perhaps
