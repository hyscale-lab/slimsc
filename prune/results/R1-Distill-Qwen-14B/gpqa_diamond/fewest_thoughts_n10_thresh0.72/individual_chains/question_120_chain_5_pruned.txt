Okay, I've got this science question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, I guess that means they're spread out evenly across the entire cosmic volume. Now, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different power laws.

Wait, what's parallax again? Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. Oh right, the formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (d = 1/plx). So a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec away, 0.5 arcseconds is 2 parsecs, and so on.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (number of stars per unit volume) is constant. Let's denote that number density as n (number per cubic parsec). 

But we need to find the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Parallax is inversely related to distance, so plx = 1/d. So plx is like a measure of 1/d.

I think it's easier to approach this by considering the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance. Let's imagine a thin shell between d and d + dd. The volume of this shell is approximately 4π d² dd. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be n multiplied by the volume: n * 4π d² dd.

But how does this relate to parallax plx? Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. So, the number of stars in a thin shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d). But wait, d is 1/plx, so when d changes by dd, plx changes by d plx. Let's see: since plx = 1/d, then d plx = - (1/d²) dd. Hmm, maybe I should find how dd relates to d plx.

Let me think. If plx = 1/d, then d plx = - (1/d²) dd. So, rearranging, dd = - d² d plx. The negative sign just shows that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, we can consider the absolute value. So, the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx)^2? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, the volume element is 4π d² dd. So, substituting d = 1/plx, we get 4π (1/plx)^2 dd. But we also need to express dd in terms of d plx. From plx = 1/d, differentiating both sides, d plx = - (1/d²) dd → dd = - d² d plx. Since we're considering a
