Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about stellar abundances and calculating the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Alright, let me break down the question.

So, the problem states that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, the mass might not be directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances. Probably, the mass is just extra info.

The elemental abundances given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the notation. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, no—the definition is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio (star/sun).

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means the ratio of Fe to H is the same as in the Sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H] = 0, so nMg/nH is same as in the Sun.

Wait, but in the question, the photospheric composition for the Sun is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7
