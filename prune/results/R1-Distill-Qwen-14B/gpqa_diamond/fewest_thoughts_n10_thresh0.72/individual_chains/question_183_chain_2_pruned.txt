Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency in the product of a reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me parse that structure. The main ring is a cyclohexene, so that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂?) Wait, no. Wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached. So 5-vinyl would be at position 5, but I'm not sure about the exact positions.

Wait, the main structure is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Then, positions 2 and 5 have substituents: formyl and vinyl.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this mentally. So, cyclohexene ring: positions 1 through 6. The double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, position 2 has a formyl (CHO) group, and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached). So the vinyl is at position 5, meaning it's attached to C5 of the ring.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH₂CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–, so it's a substituent with a double bond itself. So the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), a formyl group (which is a CHO, but that's an aldehyde, so no double bond?), and a vinyl group (which has a double bond, CH₂=CH–).

Wait, so the molecule has multiple double bonds. Let's count them. The cyclohexene has one double bond, the vinyl group has another double bond. Any others? The formyl group is just a carbonyl, which is a double bond, right? But wait, formyl is CHO. So that's a carbonyl group, which is a double bond between C and O. So, that's another double bond.

Wait, so how many double bonds are in the starting material? Let's list them:

1. Cyclohexene: 1 double bond (C3-C4).
2. Vinyl group: another double bond (between CH₂ and CH–).
3. Formyl group: another double bond (C=O).

So that's three double bonds in the starting material. Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, red phosphorus in HI usually does something with carbonyl groups. Wait, I remember that when you have a carbonyl group (like in a ketone or aldehyde) and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, it's the Clemmensen reduction! Wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and
