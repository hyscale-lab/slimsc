Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me see what's going on. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem starts with a compound: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (so, a -CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached via the middle carbon. So, structure-wise, it's a cyclohexanone with a CH2OH at C3 and an allyl group (CH2-CHCH2) attached at C5? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2? No, wait. Let me get that right. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond starting at carbon 1. Oh wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2, but wait. Wait, when you have a substituent like prop-1-en-2-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The ene is between C1 and C2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, no. Let me write it down. The parent is propene: CH2=CHCH3. The substituent would be the part after removing the hydrogen from the point of attachment. So, for prop-1-en-2-yl, the point of attachment is the second carbon. So when you take the propene, CH2-CH2-CH3, and remove the H from the second carbon, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2
