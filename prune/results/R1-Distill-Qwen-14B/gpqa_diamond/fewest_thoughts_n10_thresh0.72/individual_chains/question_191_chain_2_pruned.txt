Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me see what's going on. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem starts with a compound: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, the cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (so, a -CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like an allyl group attached via the middle carbon. So, structure-wise, it's a cyclohexanone with a CH2OH at C3 and an allyl group (CH2-CHCH2) attached at C5? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2? No, wait. Let me get that right. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond starting at carbon 1. Oh wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CHCH2, but wait. Wait, when you have a substituent like prop-1-en-2-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The ene is between C1 and C2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, no. Let me write it down. The parent is propene: CH2=CHCH3. The substituent would be the part after removing the hydrogen from the point of attachment. So, for prop-1-en-2-yl, the point of attachment is the second carbon. So when you take the propene, CH2-CH2-CH3, and remove the H from the second carbon, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH2

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step.

The compound given is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. The main ring is cyclohexanone, which is a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is a -CH2OH attached. Position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is an allyl group, right? So it's like CH2-CH2-CH2 but actually, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the prop-1-en-2-yl group would be something like CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, no. Let me draw it. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- attached where? Oh, wait, maybe it's the substituent on the cyclohexane. So the structure would have a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, a hydroxymethyl at C3, and an allyl group (CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C1 and C2, so CH2=CH-CH2-) attached at C5.

So the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

The first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, and in such reactions, it usually deprotonates something. Since the starting material has a ketone (cyclohexanone), which is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone? Wait no, because the substituents are at C3 and C5. The ketone is at C1. So the molecule is a cyclohexanone with substituents at C3 and C5. Let me imagine the cyclohexane ring: positions 1 (ketone), 3 (CH2OH), and 5 (allyl).

So when sodium hydride is added, it would deprotonate a proton alpha to the carbonyl, right? The alpha protons are on the same carbon as the carbonyl (C2) or adjacent (C3 and C6 maybe). Wait, cyclohexanone has the carbonyl at C1, so the alpha carbons would be C2 and maybe C6? Wait, in cyclohexanone, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6, because they are adjacent to the carbonyl (C1).

But the starting material has a substituent at C3, which is hydroxymethyl. So, maybe the alpha protons are on C2. So NaH would deprotonate C2, forming an enolate. Then, benzyl bromide (C6H5CH2Br) would react as an electrophile. So the enolate would attack the benzyl bromide. So the benzyl group would add to the alpha position.

Wait, so the product would have a benzyl group attached to the cyclohexanone ring at C2. Let me think. So the cyclohexanone has the ketone at C1. Deprotonating the alpha position (C2) forms an enolate, which attacks the benzyl bromide, substituting the bromide. So the product after this step would have a benzyl group at C2, making it 2-benzylcyclohexanone, but wait, also considering the other substituents.

Wait, but the starting compound has substituents at C3 and C5. So the initial structure is 3-(CH2OH) and 5-(allyl) groups. After deprotonation at C2 and alkylation with benzyl bromide, the product 1 would be 2-benzyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the enolate formed is at C3? Because the hydroxymethyl is at C3. Maybe the hydroxymethyl group is an -OH on a CH2, so the adjacent C3 would have protons alpha to the carbonyl? Wait, no, because the carbonyl is at C1. The alpha carbons are C2 and maybe C6. So C3 is a beta position.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The starting material has a cyclohexanone ring. The carbonyl is at C1. The substituents are at C3 (CH2OH) and C5 (allyl
