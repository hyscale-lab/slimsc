Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll think through it step by step.

So, the system is initially in a 1S0 state. The 1S0 notation refers to the total spin, orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum. Wait, right—the general term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, that's S=0 (since 2*0 +1=1), L=0 (since S is for spin, but in 1S0, L is denoted as S but it's orbital angular momentum. Wait no, wait. Oh, no, wait. The term is written as (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0. Because 2S+1 is 1, so S=0. L is in spectroscopic notation—S is 0, so L is 0? Wait, no. Spectroscopic notation uses S, P, D, F for L=0,1,2,3. So 1S0 would mean L=0 (S state), S=0, and J=0. Hmm, okay.

The initial state is 1S0, so T_initial is the isospin of the NN system. Wait, but the initial state must have certain properties. Oh, wait, the question says that the system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. So the process is something like NN (initial) → NN (final) + X. So the initial NN state is the same as the final state plus the emitted particle.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is the bound state, and it's emitting a particle X. So the process is initial state (bound NN) → final state (bound NN) + X. So the initial state is the bound NN in 1S0, and the final state is some other state of NN plus X.

But the question is about the final NN state. The Pauli exclusion principle says that for the final NN state, certain quantum numbers must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, the question states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) ≡ S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum, and all are mod 2. So, if T is 0, then 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L +1 must be even, meaning S + L must be odd. So S + L = 1 mod 2.

Wait, but in the problem, the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

So the final NN state must have S and L such that their sum is odd.

Now, the problem is about the possible partial waves emitted. The options are each a transition from 1S0 to some other state plus a particle (X). The particle X has intrinsic parity -1.

Parity conservation: The parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parity of the final states. So parity is multiplicative. So for the initial state, which is 1S0, what is its parity? The parity of a state is (-1)^(L), where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. The initial state is 1S0, which has L=0, so parity is (-1)^0=1.

The final state includes the NN state and the particle X. So the parity of the initial state (P_initial) equals the parity of the final NN state (P_final_NN) multiplied by the parity of X (P_X). So:

P_initial = P_final_NN × P_X.

We know P_initial is 1, and P_X is given as -1. So:

1 =
