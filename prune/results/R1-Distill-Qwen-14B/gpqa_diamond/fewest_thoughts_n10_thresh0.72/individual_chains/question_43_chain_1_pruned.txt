Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I remember that IUPAC naming for benzene rings involves numbering the substituents in such a way that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Also, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the name.

Let me read the question again. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to each other. So, their positions are 1,3,5 positions relative to each other. Wait, no, being meta means each is two carbons apart. So if one is at position 1, the next would be at 3, and the third at 5? Or maybe they're all adjacent in a meta fashion. Wait, perhaps the positions are such that each substituent is separated by a meta position. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says all three are meta to one another. That probably means that each substituent is in a position such that they are meta to each other. For benzene, that would mean they are in positions 1, 3, and 5. So, the carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and cyano are all in the 1,3,5 positions.

Wait, but wait, the other substituents complicate this. The carboxylic acid has groups ortho to it. Ortho would be positions 2 and
