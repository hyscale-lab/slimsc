Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, let's see.

So the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, so point P is well outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A to D, each giving a different expression for E.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged initially, all the charge would reside on its outer surface if it were a solid sphere. But wait, in this case, there's a cavity. Oh right, in the case of a cavity, any charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral. So if I have a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q to cancel the electric field within the conductor material. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the outer surface must then have a charge of +q to balance the -q on the inner surface.

Wait, no. Because the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it must be zero. So when you have a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have a charge of -q, and the outer surface will have a charge of +q to balance it. So overall, the conductor's net charge remains zero.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the field at P would be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor. Because the conductor is a sphere, I think the outer charge +q would distribute uniformly on the outer surface if there were no other charges or asymmetries. But wait, the cavity is not at the center of the conductor. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center. So the setup is asymmetric
