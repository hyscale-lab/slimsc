Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to take it step by step. Let me try to figure out what's going on.

The question involves several reactions, and the final product is a compound where I have to count the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. The options are from A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction step by step.

First, the initial compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I think bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta means it's a norbornene structure, right? So norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two rings: a five-membered and a three-membered ring, maybe? So position 7 would be one of the bridgehead positions. The substituent is tert-butoxy, so that's an O-t-Bu group attached there.

Then, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, sodium iodide with dibromo compoundsâ€¦ Oh, maybe it's a substitution reaction. Dibromomethyl groups could be undergoing elimination or substitution. Also, the presence of NaI suggests that maybe it's an SN2 reaction, or perhaps an elimination? Or maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo structure with an ether group. The other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that molecule has two dibromomethyl groups attached to adjacent carbons in a cyclohexadiene ring. So each of those positions (5 and 6) has a CH2Br2 group.

When this reacts with NaI at elevated temperatures, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, NaI typically provides I- as a nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination. Each CH2Br2 could lose HBr twice, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe each CH2Br2 is a leaving group, but that's not exactly right.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's a coupling reaction. The nor
