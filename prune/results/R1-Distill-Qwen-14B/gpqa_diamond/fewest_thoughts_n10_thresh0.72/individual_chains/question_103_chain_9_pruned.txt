Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question again carefully. The goal is to find the correct sequence of reactions that would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps.

Hmm, ethan-1-one is acetophenone, right? So the structure is a benzene ring with an acetyl group (COCH3) attached at one position, and there are substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromine and a nitro group. Let me visualize the benzene ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So numbering the ring, the acetyl group is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. Or wait, maybe the acetyl is at position 1, which is the meta to bromo and para to nitro. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think that the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the acetyl group.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering would depend on where the substituents are attached. Let me think: the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that's the same as phenyl group attached to the ketone, where the phenyl has a bromine at position 3 and nitro at 5. So the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5, and the acetyl group is at position 1.

So, the substituents are meta to each other. Wait, no: position 3 and 5 are both meta to the acetyl group, which is at position 1. Because in a benzene ring, positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. So the benzene ring has three substituents: at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2).

But wait, no. Wait, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group attached to the ketone is 3
