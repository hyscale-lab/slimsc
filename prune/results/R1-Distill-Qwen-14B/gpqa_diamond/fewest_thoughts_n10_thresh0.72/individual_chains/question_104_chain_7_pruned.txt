Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think through this.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets. RV detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

The question gives the shifts in the spectral lines for each planet. Planet #1 has a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. So, I need to find out how much longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The RV semi-amplitude (K) relates to the mass of the planet and other factors. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) / (M_star))^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 + M_planet/M_star) )^(2/3) ) * ( (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2) ) / ( (P/(2π)) * (1 + m_star/M_sun) )^(-1) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )

But since the planetary masses are much smaller than the stars, M_planet << M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so sqrt(1 - e²)=1.

So simplifying, K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3 * P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet * sin i) / M_star^(2/3)

But wait, sin i is 1 if the orbit is edge-on, which I think is the case for
