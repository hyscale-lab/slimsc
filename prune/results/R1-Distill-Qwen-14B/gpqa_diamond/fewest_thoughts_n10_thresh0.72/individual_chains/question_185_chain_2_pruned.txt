Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh right, sigma is the vector of Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector. So H = ε σ · n. 

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix or any 2x2 Hermitian matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation. Alternatively, maybe there's a trick here since the Pauli matrices have a specific structure.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix, and when you take their dot product with a unit vector n, you're essentially creating a matrix that's a combination of these three. So σ · n would be a 2x2 matrix where each component is the respective Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n. 

So H is ε times this combination. Now, I'm trying to recall the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, right? Because for example, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. 

But wait, in this case, it's not just a single Pauli matrix but a sum of them multiplied by components of n. How does that affect the eigenvalues? Oh wait, n is a unit vector, so the direction is arbitrary, but the magnitude of σ · n would be 1 when n is in the direction of σ. Hmm, maybe the magnitude comes into play here.

Wait, let's think about the properties of the dot product σ · n. Actually, σ · n is a matrix that for any unit vector n is a Hermitian matrix. The eigenvalues of such a matrix should be determined by its trace and determinant. Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way.

I remember that for any Hermitian matrix H, the eigenvalues are real. Since σ · n is Hermitian, its eigenvalues should be real. Also, for a 2x2 matrix, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues, and the determinant is the product.

Alternatively, another approach is to recall that the eigenvalues of a matrix like a·σ (where a is a vector) are ±|a|. Wait, because in this case, the vector a would have a magnitude of 1 since n is a unit vector.
