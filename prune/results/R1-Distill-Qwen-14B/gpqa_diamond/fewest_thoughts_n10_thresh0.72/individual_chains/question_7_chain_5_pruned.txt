Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by the process gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. So I need to find at what gamma-ray energy this process becomes significant enough to limit their lifetime.

Wait, I remember that this kind of process is about photon-photon collisions. So high-energy gamma-rays (let me call them E) are interacting with the CMB photons, which have much lower energy, say e. The average energy e is 1e-3 eV. So the CMB photon energy is much smaller than the gamma-ray energy.

I think the process is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. For this to happen, the combined energy of the two photons must be enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so together it's 1.022 MeV, which is 1.022e6 eV.

Wait, but wait, the center of mass energy squared (s) must be at least equal to (2m_e c²)^2, where m_e is the electron mass. So s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2, but wait, in the CMB frame, the photon has energy e ~ 1e-3 eV, and the gamma is much higher, say E. So E >> e, so E_γ + E_cmb ≈ E.

Wait, but actually, the condition is that the center-of-mass energy should be at least 2m_e c². But because the two photons are moving in opposite directions (I think that's the typical scenario for this annihilation), the energy is such that sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (p_γ c + p_cmb c)^2 ) ), but since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. Wait no, actually, in the lab frame where the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction to the gamma, their momenta add up. Hmm, maybe I should think about this more carefully.

Alternatively, for two photons colliding head-on, the invariant s is given by s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (p_γ c - p_cmb c)^2. Since for photons, E = p c, so s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ - E_cmb)^2.

Let me compute that: (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ - E_cmb)^2. Expanding both terms:

= (E_γ² + 2 E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb²) - (E_γ² - 2 E_γ E_cmb + E_cmb²)
= 4 E_γ E_cmb.

So s = 4 E_γ E_cmb. For the process to produce electron-positron pairs, we need sqrt(s) >= m_e c² * 2 (since each electron is m_e c²). So sqrt(4 E_γ E_cmb) >= 2 m_e c^2.

Simplifying, 2 sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) >= 2 m_e c².

Divide both sides by 2: sqrt(E_γ E_cmb) >= m_e c².

Square both sides: E_γ E_cmb >= (m_e c²)^2.

So E_γ >= (m_e c²)^2 / E_cmb.

Wait, because E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV, and m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV.

So let's compute E
