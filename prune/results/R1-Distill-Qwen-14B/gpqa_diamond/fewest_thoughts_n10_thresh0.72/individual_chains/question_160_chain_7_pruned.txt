Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining vertically along the z-axis onto this aperture. In the far field, it creates intensity maxima and minima. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Also, it's given that the angles are small, so tan(theta) can be approximated as theta.

Hmm, I remember that when a light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern observed in the far field is called the Fraunhofer diffraction. The shape of the aperture affects the diffraction pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at angles given by a sin(theta) = λ m, where m is an integer. But here, the aperture isn't a single slit; it's a polygon with N sides, and when N is very large, it approximates a circle.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So when the number of sides N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle. So maybe the problem reduces to a circular aperture? But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. For a single slit, the first minimum is at theta = λ/(a), but for a circular aperture, the first minimum is different.

Wait, let's think again. The single-slit diffraction minima occur at a sin(theta) = mλ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. The first minimum is at m=1, so theta is approximately λ/a (since for small angles, sin(theta) ≈ theta). But for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central maximum and then the first minimum occurs at a different condition. I think for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a sin(theta) = 1.22 λ, which is the famous formula for the first dark ring in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that the aperture is a polygon with N sides, and when N is infinite, it's a circle. But the problem is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the polygon becomes a circle, how does the diffraction pattern change?

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon's diffraction pattern is similar to a single slit but
