Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully and think through each step. So, the chemist does two reactions, and we need to figure out the products and then determine how many peaks appear in the HPLC chromatograms.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones. Hexan-3-one is a ketone at position 3. So when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol. So the structure would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol after the reduction. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5 because of the methoxy group. When it's reduced, the configuration might change? Let me think: LAH usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The starting material is (S) configuration, but when reduced, is there any change in the stereocenter?

Wait, the starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is: 

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, the 5-methoxy group would be on the 5th carbon. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, numbering from the ketone. Hexan-3-one is C3 as the carbonyl. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So 3 is the carbonyl.

So the structure is: 

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, perhaps I should write the structure more clearly. Let's see:

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no
