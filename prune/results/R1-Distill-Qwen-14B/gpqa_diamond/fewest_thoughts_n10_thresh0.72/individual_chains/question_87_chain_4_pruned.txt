Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbon atoms is 8. Hmm, so the aromatic ring is a benzene ring with six carbons. So the substituents must add up to two more carbons since 6 + 2 = 8. Or wait, no, because the substituents could have more than one carbon each. Wait, di-substituted implies two substituents, but each substituent can have multiple carbons. Let me think. The ring has 6 carbons, and the molecule has 8 in total, so the substituents add two carbons.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the ring has 6 carbons. If the substituents are two groups, each substituent can contribute some carbons. So 6 (ring) + substituent carbons = 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent is probably one carbon each, because 2 substituents each with one carbon would add 2, making 8. But wait, maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a single carbon. No, wait, the substituents could be for example, two methyl groups, but that would add 2 *
