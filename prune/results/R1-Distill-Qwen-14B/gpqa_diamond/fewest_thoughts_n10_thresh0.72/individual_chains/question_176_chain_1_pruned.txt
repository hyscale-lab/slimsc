Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The state of the system is given, and the matrices for P and Q are provided. I need to find the probability of getting a 0 when measuring P and then -1 when measuring Q right after.

First, let me recall what I know. Observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. When you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that operator corresponding to the measured eigenvalue.

So the process should be: measure P first, get a result (eigenvalue), which collapses the state, then measure Q on the new state.

Wait, but wait—the question is about the probability of getting P=0 and then Q=-1. So the first measurement is P, and the second is Q. The initial state is (-1, 2, 1) as a column vector.

Let me write down the given matrices.

Matrix P:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Matrix Q:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, so Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Because the diagonal matrix entries are the eigenvalues. So when you measure Q, you can get 1, 0, or -1. Similarly, P's matrix looks a bit more complicated. Let me think about P: it's a 3x3 matrix. Since it's Hermitian (I think, but I should check), which it is because the elements seem to be real. Wait, the elements are definitely real, so it's symmetric, hence Hermitian. So P is an observable.

The initial state vector is (-1, 2, 1). Let me denote this as |ψ> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. Let me check the norm of this vector. The norm squared
