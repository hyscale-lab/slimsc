Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) are used to determine the concentration of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, each β corresponds to a different complex. Let me think about the complexes.

Co(II) can form complexes with thiocyanate. The four β values probably correspond to complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands. So, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(?), and so on. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the charges. Let me think: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So, for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^+, the charge would be 2+ + (1*-1) = +1. The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Because 2*(-1) = -2; 2+ -2 = 0. Third, [Co(SCN)_3]^-? Because 3*(-1) = -3; 2+ -3 = -1. Fourth, [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Because 4*(-1) = -4; 2+ -4 = -2.

The question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So looking at the complexes, [Co(SCN)_2] would be the second complex, so β2 is 40. Wait, but β1 is 9, which would be the first complex, with one SCN-. So β1=9 is [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the second complex, so that's β2=40.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the order of the stability constants isn't necessarily in the order of the number of ligands. Wait, no, β1 is the first complex, so one ligand. So β2 is two ligands.

So the possible complexes are:

Co^2+ (free ion)
[Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40
[Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63
[Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4=16.

Wait, but β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's a
