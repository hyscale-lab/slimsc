Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about some mixtures undergoing reactions. Let's break down the given information.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually involves reactions like addition or reduction. So the compounds in X probably have double bonds because alkenes can add to bromine, causing it to decolorize.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms mixture Y. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine. Oh wait, but if Y doesn't decolorize bromine, that suggests the products don't have double bonds anymore. Maybe X's components underwent hydrogenation? But wait, the reaction is with platinum, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. But wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh right, so it's not just hydrogenation, but a disproportionation. Hmm, what's a common disproportionation reaction?

Wait, maybe the starting materials in X are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form different products. But wait, if Y is formed from X via disproportionation, perhaps the same element is involved but in different oxidation states. Wait, but X is a mixture, so two alkenes? Or maybe the alkenes are the same but undergoing some change.

Wait, but X decolorizes bromine, so they have double bonds. Then when treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes disproportionation to form Y, which doesn't. So the products after the reaction don't have double bonds anymore. So perhaps each component of X undergoes a reaction where some of it is hydrogenated (like adding H2) and some is dehydrogenated (like losing H2, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe oxidation and reduction? Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the mixture X might contain an alkene and another molecule that can undergo hydrogenation. But wait, the product Y is a mixture of two other liquids. So when X is treated with Pt (which is a catalyst for hydrogenation), the alkenes would add H2, but maybe some other reaction is happening.

Wait, but the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a single compound undergoes both oxidation and reduction. So, for example, Ozone can disproportionate into O2 and O in Ozone decomposition, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, maybe the starting materials in X are such that each component can undergo both hydrogenation and some other reaction. But since X is a mixture of two liquids, perhaps each of them undergoes a disproportionation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mixture Y is formed via the hydrogenation of X's components. Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, Y is formed as a result of disproportionation. So I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think about the next part.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Let's calculate that. So mass percent H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So if the molecular formula is CnHm, then (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = ~14.28%.

Let me calculate that. 14.28% is roughly 1/7, so 14.28% is 1/7. So m/(12n + m) = 1/7. Cross-multiplying: 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So the molecular formula is CnH2n. So Z is a hydrocarbon with H being twice the number of C. So possible structures are alkenes or alkanes, but wait in alkanes H is 2n+2. So if Z is an alkane, then 2n+2=2n → 2=0, which isn't possible. So Z must be an alkene, but wait, if Z is formed by hydrogenation of X or Y, which would typically reduce double bonds to single bonds, making alkanes. So this is confusing.

Wait, but the question says that Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. So Z is a component of Y, which is the product of X's treatment. If Z is an alkene, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, then that can't be. Because if Y has an alkene, then it would decolorize bromine. But Y doesn't. So maybe Z is an alkane.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggests that the formula is CnH2n. So for alkenes, formula is CnH2n, but for alkanes it's CnH2n+2. So maybe I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, let me redo the mass percent. Z's mass fraction of H is 14.28%. So 14.28% is equal to 1/7. So (mass of H)/(molar mass) = 1/7.

Assuming Z is an alkane, the formula is CnH2n+2. So mass of H is 2n * 1 = 2n. Molar mass is 12n + 2n + 2 = 14n + 2.

So (2n)/(14n +2) ) = 1/7 → cross multiply: 14n = 14n +2 → 0=2 → which can't be. So Z isn't an alkane.

Wait, maybe
