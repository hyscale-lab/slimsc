Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my orbital mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits and discovered via the TTV method. Oh right, TTV stands for transit timing variations, which I think is a method used to detect planets by measuring changes in the timing of a planet's transit. But maybe that's not directly relevant here, so I'll focus on the orbital periods.

The planets are in orbital resonance, which I remember means their orbital periods are in a ratio of small integers. The given ratio is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 through 5. So each planet's period is a multiple of the first one's. Let's denote the period of Planet_1 as P1. Then P2 is 2*P1, P3 is 2.5*P1, P4 is 3.5*P1, and P5 is 5*P1.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that's a given. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. The formula I recall is T = [(L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since albedo and σ cancel out when taking the ratio, maybe I don't need to worry about them here.

Wait, but the key thing here is the distance D. Since the planets are in orbit around the star, their distance D relates to their orbital period via Kepler's third law. So Kepler's law states that P² is proportional to D³ (assuming a circular orbit and same star for all planets). More precisely, P² = (4π²/GM) * D³, so D³ is proportional to P². Therefore, D is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the distance D for each planet can be expressed as D = k * P^(1/3), wait, no: wait, let me think again. Let me get the exact relation. Kepler's third law is often written as (D^3)/(P^2) = (G M) / (4 π²), which is a constant for a given star. So D^3 ∝ P^2 → D ∝ P^(2/3). So yes, each planet's distance is proportional to the square of its period to the 1/3 power.

So for two planets, say Planet_2 and Planet_4, their distances would be D2 and D4. D2 = k * (P2)^(2/3), and D4 = k * (P4)^(2/3). The ratio D4/D2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T4 and T2 would be based on the inverse square law of distance. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, so the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Wait, no: because the equilibrium temperature formula includes (1/(D^2))^(1/2), since the formula is (L (1 - a))/(16 π σ D²), so when you take the fourth root, it's proportional to (1/D^2)^(1/4) → 1/D^(1/2). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of D.

So the ratio T4/T2 = (D2 / D4)^(1/2). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so (T4 / T2) = (D2 / D4)^(1/2).

Wait, let me see: T ∝ 1/sqrt(D). So T4 = (1/sqrt(D4)) * C, T2 = (1/sqrt(D2)) * C. So T4/T2 = sqrt(D2/D4).

Right, so the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt(D2/D4).

But D2/D4 is (P2^(2/3) ) / (P4^(2/3)) ) → ( (P2/P4) )^(2/3) ) → ( (2 P1)/(3.5 P1) )^(2/3) → (2/3.5)^(2/3).

Simplify 2/3.5. 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7. So (4/7)^(2/3).

So T4/T2 = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) → (4/7)^(1/3) → cube root of (4/7).

Alternatively, since (4/7)^(2/3) is ( (4/7)^(1/3) )², and taking the square root gives (4/7)^(1/3).

So let's compute (4/7)^(1/3). So 4 is approx 4, 7 is 7. So 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

The cube root of 0.5714 is approximately equal to what?

I know that 0.5³ is 0.125, 0.7³ is 0.343, 0.8³ is 0.512, 0.83³ is about 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889, 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.571. Oh wait, that's exactly 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. So 0.83³ is approximately 0.571.

So cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83. So (4/7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.83.

So T4/T2 is approximately 0.83. Wait, but wait a second: the question asks for the ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So that ratio is T4 / T2 = 0.83. So the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is ~83% that of Planet_2. So the options are to see which is ~0.83.

Looking at the options: Option C is ~0.83.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Orbital period ratios: 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

2. Kepler's third law: D ∝ P^(2/3). So D2 is (P2/P1)^(2/3) times D1, and D4 is (P4/P1)^(2/3) times D1.

3. So D2/D4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3) = (2 / 3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2
