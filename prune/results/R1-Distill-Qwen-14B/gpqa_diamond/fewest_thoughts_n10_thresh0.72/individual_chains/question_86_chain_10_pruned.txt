Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question is about two reactions where different reducing agents are used on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but I guess the starting materials would determine which enantiomer forms.

Wait, the products are enantiomers of each other. The first reaction uses LiBH4, and the second uses BH3. Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Oh wait, no, wait. LiBH4 is actually a stronger reducing agent than BH3Â·THF (which is a common source of BH3). Or maybe it's the other way around? Wait, let me think. BH3 is a weaker reducing agent because it's less nucleophilic. LiBH4 is more powerful because it can donate BH4- which is a better hydride donor. So when you use LiBH4, you get more reduction happening compared to BH3.

Wait, but wait, in the context of ketone reductions, both LiBH4 and BH3 can reduce ketones. Oh, but wait, maybe the sterochemistry is involved here. Because the problem is about whether the starting material leads to R or S configuration in the product.

So the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Looking at the structure,
