Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, let me see. The reaction is Pi+ decaying into a mu+ and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, so that's an important point. Oh right, the rest masses are given: Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and mu+ is 105.7 MeV. Wait, what about the neutrino? I think neutrinos are almost massless, so maybe I can approximate their mass as zero. That should simplify things.

Wait, the question is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So, the products are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so after decay, the total momentum must also be zero. That means the momenta of the two products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu.

Now, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c (but since we're working in MeV units, maybe the c factors are absorbed, so E_nu = |p_nu| * c). Wait, but in particle physics, energy is often expressed in MeV, and momentum in MeV/c. So, for the neutrino
