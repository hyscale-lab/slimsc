Okay, I'm trying to tackle this physics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

So, the question is about comparing the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, and B is 1 Tesla. They also mention that m is small, which probably refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is related to the transition energy since wavelength and energy are inversely related.

Hmm, I remember that the transition energy ΔE can be calculated using the wavelength λ. The formula that connects them is ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Let me jot that down.

Wait, what about the paramagnetic coupling term? I think that's related to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. Oh right, in the Zeeman effect, the energy shift is proportional to m, which is the magnetic quantum number. So the paramagnetic coupling term would be the energy shift due to the magnetic field.

So the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m and B. But wait, m can take small values, like m = 0, ±1, etc. Wait, but m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which for hydrogen can be up to l, where l is the azimuthal quantum number. But I'm not sure if that's crucial here. Maybe I should focus on the magnitude comparison.

Let me compute both terms. First, calculate ΔE using the given wavelength.

λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 meters.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (0.
