Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about star luminosities. Let me read the question again and think step by step.

Alright, the question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, same peak wavelengths. They also measured the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The task is to compute by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the key here is to find the temperatures of the two stars and then calculate their luminosities.

Wait, but how do we find the temperatures? Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). Since the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same (λ_max1 = λ_max2), this implies that their temperatures are the same. Because if λ is the same, then T = b/λ, so same λ means same T. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, because if λ_max1 equals λ_max2, then T1 must equal T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the radial velocities are different. Oh, but radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So what's the relationship between the star's actual temperature and the observed wavelength? Hmm, perhaps that's a factor here. Because the star's motion can shift the observed wavelength.

Oh right! The Doppler effect for light. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted (shorter
