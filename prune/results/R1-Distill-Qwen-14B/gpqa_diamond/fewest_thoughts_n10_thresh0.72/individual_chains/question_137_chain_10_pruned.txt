Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that a cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator, and the synchrocyclotron is a variant of it. The question is about how many revolutions a proton makes as it's accelerated from negligible kinetic energy to 950 MeV. 

Let me read the problem again. So, the proton is injected at t=0 with T≈0, and it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t)=U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data are Φ0=π/4 and U0=190 kV. The options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. Synchrocyclotrons use a different approach than regular cyclotrons. In a cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant, and the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the electric field region. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time to keep the particles in step with the accelerating electric field, which is oscillating. Oh right, because the cyclotron frequency depends on the mass and charge of the particle and the magnetic field. So as the magnetic field increases, the particles' orbits change, but the timing of the electric field is adjusted to match their changing speeds.

In this problem, the voltage is given as a cosine function. I think the key here is to relate the kinetic energy gained by the proton to the number of times it's accelerated, which would correspond to the number of revolutions.

The kinetic energy of the proton is given as 950 MeV. Since the initial kinetic energy is negligible, almost all of that comes from the acceleration in the synchrocyclotron.

Each time the proton passes through the accelerating gap, it gains some energy. In a regular cyclotron, each full revolution gives a fixed energy gain. But in a synchrocyclotron, the energy per revolution increases because the magnetic field is changing, which affects the time it takes for each revolution. Hmm, but wait, the problem says it undergoes two accelerations. Maybe each acceleration is a single application of the voltage, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...). So each time the voltage completes a cycle, the proton goes through the accelerating gaps twice—once on the rising edge and once on the falling edge? Or maybe each cycle corresponds to a single acceleration. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of times the voltage completes a cycle.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the basic concepts. The kinetic energy gained by a charge in an electric field is given by the integral of the electric potential over the distance, but in this case, each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated by the voltage U(t). Since the voltage is oscillating, each time the voltage is at its maximum (positive or negative), the proton gets a kick.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied across the dees (the D-shaped electrodes), and the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap. So in each oscillation period of the electric field, the proton passes through the gap twice (once on each dees), gaining energy each time.

So for each cycle of the electric field, the proton has two chances to gain energy. So each cycle adds two energy increments. But wait, that's only if the phase is correct. So in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is varied so that the frequency of the electric field is synchronized with the particle's motion.

But perhaps that's getting more detailed than I need right now. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The key formula I think I need is the relation between the energy gained and the number of revolutions or the number of times the particle is accelerated.

The kinetic energy (T) gained by the proton is equal to the sum of the energies gained in each acceleration. Each acceleration imparts an energy of e * U, where e is the charge of the proton and U is the voltage. But wait, the voltage here is U0, but it's a cosine function. So the maximum voltage is U0. So each time the voltage is at maximum, the proton is accelerated by e*U0.

But wait, in reality, the actual energy gained per passage depends on how much time the voltage is applied and the particle's speed, but perhaps for a first approximation, we can model each passage as gaining e*U0 of energy.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each time the voltage is applied (each half cycle) the proton is accelerated. In a regular cyclotron, each full cycle (one period) gives two accelerations. So for each cycle of the electric field, the proton is accelerated twice.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the situation is a bit different. The magnetic field
