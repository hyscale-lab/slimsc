Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can get a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which sequence of reactions would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reagents.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl ring has substituents in the 3 and 5 positions. The 3 position has a bromo group, and the 5 position has a nitro group. Then, the ethan-1-one part is a ketone attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So the benzene ring is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), and that's connected to a methyl group (CH3). So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at 3 and 5 positions, and a ketone (acetophenone-like) group attached at the 1 position.

Wait, no, wait. The substituent is at the 1 position of the phenyl group. Wait, when they say 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, the ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone group, a bromo, and a nitro group.

Wait, no, the numbering is such that the ketone is at position 1. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the benzene ring has the ketone (COCH3) at position 1, bromo at position 3, and nitro at position 5.

Wait, let me think. Benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is at position 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6, and the opposite is position 4. So the 3 and 5 positions are the
