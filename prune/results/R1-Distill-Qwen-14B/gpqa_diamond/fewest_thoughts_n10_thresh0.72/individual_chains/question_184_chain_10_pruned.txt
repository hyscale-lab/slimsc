Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let's parse that structure. 

So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering can get tricky. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro? Or wait, maybe I should draw it out mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assign the substituents based on their positions. Let's see: the formula is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Wait, but when numbering, you put the substituents in alphabetical order. Wait, ethoxy (OCH2CH3), nitro (NO2), tert-butyl. Alphabetically, ethoxy comes after nitro? Or wait, the order is based on substituent names. Let me think: Ethoxy starts with E, Nitro starts with N, tert-butyl with T. So the
