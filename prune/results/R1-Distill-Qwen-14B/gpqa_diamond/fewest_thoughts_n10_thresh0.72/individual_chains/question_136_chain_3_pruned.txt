Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r². And the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. And the volume integral of divergence over a volume gives something related to sources or sinks within that volume—like the divergence theorem, which connects the volume integral of divergence to the flux through the surface.

Wait, wait. The Divergence Theorem! That's the key. The theorem states that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector.

In this problem, the volume is a sphere of radius R. So the surface is a sphere of radius R. So I can compute either the volume integral of the divergence or the surface integral of the vector field dotted with the normal.

But wait, wait. Since the vector field only has a radial component, f = f_r r̂, I can probably calculate the divergence more easily. Let me recall how divergence works in spherical coordinates.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field f is given by:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(f_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂f_φ/∂φ

But in this case, the field has only a radial component, so f_θ and f_φ are zero. That simplifies things a lot.

So ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r )

Given that f_r is the radial component. Since the magnitude is 1/r², and the field is purely radial, that means f_r = 1/r².

So plugging into the divergence formula:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²
