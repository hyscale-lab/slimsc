Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem talks about a diatomic molecule, made up of atoms X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of an absorbed photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can have various energy states due to their vibrational and rotational motions. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, I think. To move to the next state, the molecule must absorb a photon with the right energy.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because when a photon is absorbed, it imparts momentum to the molecule. The energy of the photon relates to its momentum via E = pc, where p is momentum and c is the speed of light. So I guess I'll need to find the energy difference between the states and then find the corresponding momentum.

The atoms have masses Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the molecule switching to the next state. I'm a bit fuzzy on the transition rules for rotational and vibrational states. Oh right, in the rigid rotor model, transitions are usually ΔJ = ±1. But this is a non-rigid rotor, so perhaps it's a vibration-rotation model where both vibrational and rotational changes happen?

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So it's considering both vibrational and rotational energy changes. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). To move to the next state, which would have the lowest possible energy, the molecule would likely transition to the next higher vibrational state (v=1) or change to a higher rotational state (J=1), whichever requires less energy. Or wait, maybe it's a combination of both, but I'm not sure.

Wait no, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next vibr
