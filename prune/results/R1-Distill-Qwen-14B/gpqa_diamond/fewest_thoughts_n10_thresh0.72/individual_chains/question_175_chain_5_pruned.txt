Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. It says that this distribution will radiate at a certain wavelength λ. The problem is asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function f(λ, θ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is given as A, and I need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f, which is the power per unit solid angle.

Hmm, I remember that in electromagnetism, especially when dealing with dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle θ. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern isn't isotropic. I think the maximum radiation is along the equator, perpendicular to the dipole's axis. Wait, no, wait. In a dipole's case, the radiation is maximum at θ = 90 degrees, right? Because the dipole's radiation pattern has a sin²θ dependence. So when θ is 90, sinθ is 1, so that's the peak.

But this question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal. So it's not exactly a dipole, but maybe the same kind of angular dependence applies. Let me think. The general form of the radiated power per unit solid angle for an oscillating dipole is something like (p² sin²θ)/(something with λ and constants). Wait, but I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula.

Wait, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The power (P) radiated by an accelerating charge is ( (q² a² )/(6πε₀ c³) ), but that's for a point charge. But when considering an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern varies with angle.

I remember that for the dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle (dP/dΩ) is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum would be at θ=90°, and it would drop off as you move towards θ=0 or 180°. But wait, the maximum in the radiation pattern
