Okay, so I've got this science question here about rotavirus and some experiments with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Wait, secondary lymphoid organs are like places where immune responses happen, right? So the Peyer's patches are part of that.

They isolated the proliferating cells from these patches and sequenced their variable heavy chain genes. There was high variability. I'm trying to remember what processes lead to variability in antibodies. Oh right, immune response involves a few key steps.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

So, when the immune system is exposed to an antigen, B cells are activated. I think that during this process, the B cells undergo several changes. VDJ recombination happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow, which sets the initial diversity of the B cell receptor. But once they're activated, they can do somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of the antibody.

Class switching is when the type of antibody is changed (like from IgM to IgG), which is part of the immune response. Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking the pathogens.

But the question is about the variability in the variable heavy chain after the immune response. Somatic hypermutation occurs in the germinal centers, where B cells proliferate and mutate their antibody genes to increase affinity. So if they're seeing high variability in the variable regions after exposure, that must be due to somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but when you give an antigen, the B cells that recognize it get activated. They go to the lymph nodes and multiply, and during this phase, they undergo hypermutation. So sequencing the variable regions would show a lot of diversity because each cell's antibody has slightly different sequences due to this process.

So the process happening here is somatic hypermutation, which is option A. The other options don't fit as well. VDJ is during B cell development, not during the immune response. Class switching happens after the initial response, changing the type of antibody produced. Complement activation is part of the response but doesn't directly cause variability in the heavy chain genes.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence imaging reveals that some GFP-tagged proteins are destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. The fluorescent Peyer's patches are isolated, and the proliferating cell population's variable heavy chain genes are sequenced, showing high variability.

This variability is likely due to processes that occur during the immune response. Somatic hypermutation is a key mechanism that increases diversity in the variable regions of antibodies during the germinal center reaction. It occurs in activated B cells and leads to high variability in the variable heavy chain genes, which matches the observations in the experiment. 

Other options are less relevant: VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, not during the immune response; class switching recombination changes the antibody isotype but does not explain the variability in the variable heavy chain; and complement activation is part of the immune response but does not directly cause variability in the heavy chain sequence.

Thus, the process responsible for the observed variability is somatic hypermutation.

Answer: A
