Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the power of 5. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, right. Parallax is a measure of distance, so I know that parallax and distance are inversely related. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is equal to 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So, plx = 1 / d, where d is the distance. 

Wait, so if plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. So, the parallax and distance are inversely proportional. That's important.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So, like, if you go from distance r to r+dr, how does the number of stars in that shell change? I think this relates to the number density of stars at different distances.

So, let's think about the relation. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/d, then substituting, N ∝ d^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, but I think what they're getting at is the differential number of stars per unit distance. Because when you look at a region of the sky, you're considering a volume of space. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell, multiplied by the volume element. Wait, no, actually, wait: the number of stars in a volume element is what we're considering.

Let me think again. The number of stars in a region is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let's express this in terms of distance. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, that's for a fixed region of the sky? Or does N represent the number density?

Wait, maybe I should think
