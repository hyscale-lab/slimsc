Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem about annihilation processes. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles each with opposite charges, A⁺ and A⁻. Interesting.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are given in terms of c, which is the speed of light. And we're told that the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe its speed is much less than c. Also, the mass-energy of each A particle is 300 MeV. Wait, so m_A c² is 300 MeV. I remember that for particles, their rest mass energy is given by m c², so that's straightforward.

Since it's an annihilation process, I think conservation laws come into play here, like conservation of energy and momentum. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. What are their rest masses? Well, a proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². Similarly, the antiproton has the same mass because it's the antimatter counterpart. So each has a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps its velocity is non-relativistic, but in the context of particle physics, even slow might be a significant fraction of c, but perhaps it's better to treat it as a small velocity compared to c. But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. But the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. If the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps not. Wait, the problem only states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is much less than the proton's speed. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Wait, no—wait. The initial setup isn't in the center of mass frame. The proton and antiproton are colliding. So I need to consider the frame where the
