Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance, X. 

The given parameters are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. And I need to find the mean decay distance from the options provided.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the mean lifetime (τ) multiplied by the speed of light (c) should give the mean decay length. So, decay distance L = cτ.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? I remember something about the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The natural line width or the decay width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The formula I think is Γ = ħ / τ. So rearranged, τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I should probably make sure about the units here. Let's get into the details.

So, first, calculate the lifetime τ. Since Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit, and ħ is in units of GeV·s (or something else?), I need to convert everything properly.

Wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm, but wait, let me get that right. Oh, the value of ħc is about 197.33 MeV·fm. But maybe that's a different approach. Alternatively, if I have Γ in GeV, I can calculate τ.

So, let's see. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV). Let me calculate that. 

Dividing 6.582e-25 by 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. 6.582 / 0.
