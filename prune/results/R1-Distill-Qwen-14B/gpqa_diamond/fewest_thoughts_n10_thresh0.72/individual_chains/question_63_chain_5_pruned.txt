Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and photon momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. So I think that means it's moving from the ground state to the first excited state. Since it's a diatomic molecule, probably modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember is sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model.

Wait, okay, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So the energy states probably involve both rotational and vibrational energy levels. But the question is about the photon's momentum needed for the transition. Oh, right, when a photon is absorbed, its energy causes a transition between energy levels. The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states.

But wait, the problem is asking about the momentum of the photon, not the energy. Oh, right, because momentum p is related to energy for a photon. But wait, for a photon, energy E is related to its frequency by E = hÎ½, and momentum p is E/c, since for photons, p = E/c. So if I can find the energy difference, I can find the momentum.

So first, I need to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state. Wait, but what's the fundamental state here? In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and have terms for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state would be the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. The next state would involve either a vibrational or rotational transition, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but the molecule is in its fundamental state. If it's a diatomic, the ground state is the lowest vibrational level (n=0) and the lowest rotational level (J=0). But I'm not entirely sure about that; sometimes the ground state might have J=0 for rotation, but vibrational states start at n=0. So the next state could be either a transition to J=1 (rotational) or n=1 (vibrational). But the question says the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think the photon's energy should be the lowest possible to cause a transition, which would be the lowest energy possible, so probably the vibrational transition from n=0 to n=1.

Wait, no. Wait, the vibrational energy levels have
