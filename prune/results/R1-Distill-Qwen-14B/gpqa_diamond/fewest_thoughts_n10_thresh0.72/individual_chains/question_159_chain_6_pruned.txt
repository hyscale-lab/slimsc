Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak in the near infrared and optical spectrum at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly at shorter wavelengths. Oh wait, that's probably the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to the Lyman series. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, but intergalactic medium might cause absorption at certain wavelengths. Oh wait, maybe it's about the Lyman break?

Wait, the Lyman break refers to the wavelength beyond which the universe was more neutral, right? So when the universe reionized, the Lyman series (like Lyman-alpha at 121.6 nm) started being transmitted. So if a quasar's spectrum shows a peak at 790 nm and drops below that, maybe that's the Lyman break. Because 790 nm is in the near-infrared. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight.

Wait, the Lyman break is actually when the observed wavelength is longer than the rest wavelength multiplied by (1+z), where z is the redshift. So the rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then 790 = 121.6*(1+z). That would give (1+z)=6.5, so z≈5.5. Is that right? Let me check the math.

121.6 nm * (1+z) = 790 nm. So 1+z = 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5. So z≈5.5. Ok, so the quasar is at a redshift of about z=5.5.

Now the question is about the comoving distance at a=1 (which is now), so that's the current comoving distance to the quasar.

The universe is flat, and the parameters are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7.

I remember that the comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt( Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ*(1+z)^3w + Ωr*(1+z)^4 ), but for high z, radiation is negligible, so we can ignore Ωr.

Wait, dark energy is usually modeled as a cosmological constant, so w=-1, so (1+z)^3w = (1+z)^-3. So E(z) = sqrt( 0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7*(1+z)^-3 ).

So the integral for D_C is (c/H0) * ∫ from 0 to z [1/sqrt(0.3(1+z')^3 + 0.7(1+z')^{-3}) ] dz'

Hmm, but integrating this from 0 to z=5.5. That's a bit complicated. I don't think I can do
