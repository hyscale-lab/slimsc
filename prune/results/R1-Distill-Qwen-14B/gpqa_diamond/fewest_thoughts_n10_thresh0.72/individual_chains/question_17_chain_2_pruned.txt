Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which probably is the calcium-EDTA complex. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong this complex is. A high K means the complex is stable and forms readily.

So, the problem is about finding the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because the Ca-EDTA complex is formed, the free Ca²+ concentration is going to be low, right? Because most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex.

I think the formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, I should make sure about the stoichiometry. EDTA typically has a 1:1 ratio with metal ions, so each Ca²+ binds one EDTA^4-.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote that as C. So, [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would each be 0.02 M if they were free, but in reality, some of the Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will form the complex.

But wait, I think the assumption here is that the concentration of the complex is much higher than the free ions because K is so large. So perhaps I can approximate [Ca²+] as being much smaller than the concentration of the complex, so the dissociation is minimal. That makes sense because K is 5e10, which is a very large number, so the complex doesn't dissociate much.

So if I let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x, then the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole
