Okay, so I need to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's read it again. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong monobasic acid. We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and the total volume is 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the solution.

Hmm, first, I think I should find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... Let's see, Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So each OH is 17 g/mol. Since there are three OH groups, that's 3 * 17 =51, plus Fe is 55.85, so 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait wait, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Because Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ and three OH^- ions. So the formula is Fe(OH)3, which has a molar mass of Fe (55.85) + 3*(O + H) → 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate that: 0.1 divided by 106.85.

Wait, 106.85 is approximately 106.85. So 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.0009357 mol. Let me write that as approximately 9.357e-4 mol.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong monobasic acid, say HCl, the reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O

Wait, yeah, because Fe(OH)3 is a triprotic base, I think. Each OH can react with a H+ from the acid. Since it's monobasic, each molecule of acid provides one H+. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of HCl.

So moles of HCl needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of HCl = 3 * 9.357e-4 ≈ 2.807e-3 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol/L. So volume needed is moles / concentration.

So volume = 2.807e-3 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.02807 dm³. Since 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³, 0.02807 dm³ is 28.07 cm³.

Wait, but wait a second. The options don't have exactly 28.07. Let me check the options. Option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Option B is 30.09 cm³. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol:

0.1 / 106.85 = 0.0009357 mol. So that's correct. Then 3 times that is 0.002807 mol of HCl.

0.1 M HCl is 0.1 mol per dm³, so volume is 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 dm³, which is 28.07 cm³. So the closest option is C) 28.05 cm³, but that's very close. Maybe I should check if I calculated 0.1 / 106.85 correctly.

Wait, 106.85 is the molar mass. Let me compute 0.1 / 106.85 accurately:

0.1 / 106.85 = approximately 0.000935714 mol. So 0.000935714 *3 =0.00280714 mol. So 28.0714 cm³. Hmm, so option C is 28.05, which is very close. But maybe the exact molar mass is a bit different? Let me check. Fe is 55.845, each OH is 17.0074. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.845 + 3*(17.0074) =55.845 +51.0222=106.8672 g/mol.

So 0.1 g / 106.8672 g/mol = approx 0.0009355 mol. Multiply by 3 is 0.00
