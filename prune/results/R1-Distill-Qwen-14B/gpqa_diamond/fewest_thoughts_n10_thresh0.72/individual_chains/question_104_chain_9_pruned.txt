Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the RV method. Hmm, I remember that RV stands for radial velocity, right? It's the method where you look for shifts in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. The planets have circular orbits, so that should simplify things. 

They detected the first planet with a spectral line shift of up to 5 milliangstroms. The second planet caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) to the mass of the planet and other factors. The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P) * (2π) )^(1/3) ) ). Hmm, maybe I should look for a simpler approach.

Alternatively, I recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the orbital period when other factors are constant. Because K is proportional to (M_p / (M_* + M_p))^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) * (G/(c))^something. But since M_p is much less than M_*, and the stars are the same mass, the (M_p/M_*) term can be approximated as M_p/(M_*). Wait, no, because M_* is the same for both, and M_p is same for both (both similar to Neptune), so M_p/(M_*) is the same for both planets. That simplifies things.

So if M_* is same and M_p is same, then K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), because K ∝ (1/P)^(1/3). Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by: 

K = [ (G * M_p^3 sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c)) ) 

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K. Let me try to write it more simply.

The formula I remember is K = ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^2) )^(1/3) )

But since both stars are the same mass (M_* same), and both planets have same mass (M_p same), and same sin i (assuming same inclination, which for RV is usually sin i ≈ 1 because the planets are detected, so probably face-on or not), then K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). Because if you look at K, it's proportional to (M_p / M_*^2 )^(
