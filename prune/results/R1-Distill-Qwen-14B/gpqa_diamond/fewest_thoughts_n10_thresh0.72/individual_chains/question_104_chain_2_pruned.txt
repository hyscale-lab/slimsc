Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the stars are identical, and the planets have the same mass. Interesting.

The data given is about the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does this shift relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) ), but wait, maybe that's too detailed. Alternatively, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (2πG/(M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)))^(1/3) * M_p sin i. Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relationship between K and the orbital period.

I think the formula for K is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^0.5 )) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

But for circular orbits, e is zero, so that term is 1. And since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should think of K inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because when you rearrange the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is larger, the period should be smaller.

In the question, planet #1 has a shift (K) of 5 mA, and planet #2 has 7 mA. Wait, but wait: the shift is the semi-amplitude of the RV. So K is larger when the star moves more, which is when the planet's mass is larger or when the period is shorter.

Wait, but in our case, both planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), and the stars have same mass. So the only difference is the period, and the K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}.

So K1 = 5, K2=7.

But wait, let me think in terms of the formula. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), which can be written as P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So if K increases, P decreases.

So if K1 =5 and K2=7, then K2 is larger than K1. That would mean that P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So P2 / P1 = ?

Let me get the proportion right. K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * C, and K2 = (1/P2^(1/3))
