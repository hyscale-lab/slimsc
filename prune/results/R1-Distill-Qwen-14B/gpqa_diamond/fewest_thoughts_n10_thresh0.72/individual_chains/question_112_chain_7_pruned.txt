Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question involves an electron state and some operators. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The state is given as |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. That means any state can be expressed in terms of these.

First, since |alpha> is proportional to that expression, I should probably normalize it. So I'll find the normalization constant. The general approach is to compute the inner product of the state with itself and set it equal to 1.

Let me write out the state more clearly. Let's denote |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 - i). Wait, actually, the question says it's proportional, so the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but without normalization. So the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of a and b.

So the normalization factor N is such that |N a|^2 + |N b|^2 = 1. So N squared times (|a|^2 + |b|^2) equals 1. So I need to compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Calculating |a|^2: a is (1+i), so |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Similarly, |b|^2: b is (2 - i). So the square of the magnitude is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor N is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So the state |alpha> is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no, because the question says it's proportional, so the actual state is multiplied by a normalization constant. So yeah, that's correct.

Next part: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, the matrix is 2x2 because spin-1/2 has two states. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

Wait, let me write out the matrix. The operator A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else zero. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would be:

[ 0     ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix, right. So that
