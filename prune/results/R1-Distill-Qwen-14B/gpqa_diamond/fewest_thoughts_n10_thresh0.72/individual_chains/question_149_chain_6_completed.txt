Alright, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about analyzing a crude peptidic compound's NMR and LC-MS data. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. And the coupling pattern isn't due to spin-spin coupling because we can rule that out. Wait, why would there be two peaks then?

In NMR, if a proton has two different neighboring groups or environments, it can split into multiple peaks. But wait, the coupling pattern is ruled out, so it's not about splitting from adjacent protons. Another possibility is that the proton is in a diastereomeric environment. Or maybe it's due to some other structural isomerism.

Looking at the options, option D says the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But wait, in this case, the peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So in each diastereomer, that proton would be in a slightly different environment, leading to two different shifts. But the integrals add up to 1H, suggesting each diastereomer has one of those protons. So that makes sense.

But wait, what about option B, enantiomers? Enantiomers are mirror images. In that case, the NMR peaks for the same proton would typically overlap because they're identical except for the direction of the magnetic field. So if they're enantiomers, you'd expect a single peak, not two. So B might not be the answer.

Option A is about a precursor. If there's a precursor present, its NMR would have different peaks. But the question says the NMR is consistent except for two peaks, which are the same alpha-proton. So a precursor might have other peaks, but the main molecule's alpha-proton would still be one peak. So A might not explain this.

Option C talks about 'double coupling' during an amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that is. Maybe during an amide formation, like in a coupling reaction, sometimes you can get some byproducts or alternative structures. But I'm not sure how that would lead to two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Maybe if there's an alternative coupling pathway, but I'm not certain.

Back to the NMR point: the same proton having two peaks with same integration. Also, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So mass spec can't tell apart diastereomers because they have the same molecular weight. So if the compound is a mix of diastereomers, the LC would separate them (if they have different retention times) and show two peaks. Mass spec would see the same mass because it's the same molecular weight.

So if the compound is a diastereomeric mixture, then both NMR and LC-MS data make sense. The NMR would show two peaks for the same proton in each diastereomer, and LC-MS would show two peaks because the diastereomers have different physical properties (like retention time) but same mass.

Wait, but can diastereomers have the same mass spectrum? Yes, because mass spec is based on the molecular weight. The same molecular formula, so same mass. Hence, the LC-MS would show two peaks of same mass, each with same intensity. That fits.

So, putting it all together: the NMR has two peaks for the same proton because of two diastereomeric forms, and LC-MS shows two peaks because they're separate on the column but same mass.

So the correct answer should be D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing a crude peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and a coupling pattern that rules out spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule.

To evaluate the options:

- **Option A (Contamination with a precursor):** A precursor would likely introduce additional peaks in the NMR and LC-MS that are distinct from the expected molecule. However, the question specifies that the NMR and LC-MS data are consistent with the expected molecule except for the two peaks, making this explanation unlikely.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):** Enantiomers are mirror images and typically produce identical NMR spectra because they have the same electronic environment for protons. This would result in a single peak for the alpha-proton, not two, so this option does not explain the observations.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation):** While 'double coupling' could theoretically lead to multiple peaks, it is not a common explanation for the observed NMR pattern. Additionally, this does not account for the LC-MS data, which shows two peaks of the same mass.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):** Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical environments, leading to distinct NMR signals for the same proton. This explains the two peaks in the NMR spectrum. The LC-MS data also aligns because diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties (e.g., retention time), resulting in two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum.

Given the data, the most plausible explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

Answer: D
