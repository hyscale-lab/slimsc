Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on its reaction product's NMR spectra. 

First, let me read through the problem again. The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given. The options are four different epoxide compounds, so I think the reaction might be forming an epoxide or perhaps opening one.

Wait, wait. Diazabicyclooctane is a base, right? Oh, right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is commonly known as DBU. DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base often used in elimination reactions. So if it's reacting with compound X, maybe it's deprotonating something to form a double bond or cause an elimination.

Hmm. So compound X is C11H12O. Let's look at the options. All options are epoxides, right? Wait, no, the options are four structures. Let me check each. Option A is 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Oxirane is another name for epoxide. So all options are epoxide derivatives. 

Wait, but if the reaction is with DBU, perhaps it's causing ring-opening of the epoxide? Or maybe it's part of another reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an elimination. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the product's NMR is from the starting material X, but wait, the question says the product's spectra are given. So X is reacting to form a product, and we need to identify X based on the product's NMR.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, "the theoretical 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra of the resulting product reveal..." So the product's spectra are given, and we need to find what X was. So X is the starting material, and the product is the result of X reacting with
