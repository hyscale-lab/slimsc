Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a density matrix which is Gaussian in the phase space, like coherent states or squeezed states. Non-Gaussian states are more complicated, like cat states.

The state given is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. And N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Wait, the non-Gaussianity here is calculated using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

I think the key here is understanding what the reference Gaussian state is. Because for the relative entropy, you compare the given state to a Gaussian one. So I need to figure out what Gaussian state is the best to compare to, perhaps the closest Gaussian state to |psi>.

Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies when phi is -pi/4. Let me plug that in. Phi is -pi/4. So sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) which is -1. Let's compute N first.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). Plugging in phi=-pi/4, sin(2*(-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So the term inside the sqrt is 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6276.

So the state becomes [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6276.

Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt
