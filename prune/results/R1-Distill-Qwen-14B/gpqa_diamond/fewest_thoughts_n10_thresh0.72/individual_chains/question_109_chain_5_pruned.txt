Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says that a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron or something) in a 1S0 state emits a particle X. The intrinsic parity of X is -1. Oh wait, parity—right, parity is a quantum number that tells us about the symmetry of the wavefunction under spatial inversion. Intrinsic parity is about the particle itself. So particle X has parity -1.

Pauli statistics come into play here. Pauli's exclusion principle says that identical particles must have a total wavefunction that's antisymmetric under exchange. Since nucleons are fermions, their combined wavefunction must change sign when they swap places. So the total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and other parts, and the overall symmetry must be considered.

The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. I'm not too sure about the isospin part, but maybe it's part of the overall consideration for the symmetry.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So the isospin is zero. I think for two nucleons, which are fermions, their combined isospin can be either 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). But here it's 0, so the isospin part is symmetric or antisymmetric? I think isospin is part of the internal symmetry, and for identical particles, their overall symmetry involves isospin, spin, and spatial parts.

Wait, but the problem says that the equation involves T, S, and L. So T is the isospin quantum number. For two identical nucleons, the isospin can be 0 or 1. When T=0, that's a singlet state, which is symmetric under exchange? Or antisymmetric? Wait no, isospin singlet is antisymmetric under exchange, I think, because the isospin wavefunction for T=0 is antisymmetric, just like spin singlet.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the overall wavefunction. The total wavefunction must be antisymmetric for fermions. The total wavefunction is the product of spatial (orbital), spin, and isospin parts. So for two identical particles, each part must have a symmetry that when multiplied together, the total is antisymmetric.

In this case, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1=1 => S=0. L is S, so L=0. And J is 0. So initial state is spin 0 (singlet?), orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum 0.

So the initial NN state is 1S0. Then they emit a particle X, so the final state is NN plus X. Wait, no, the question says the final NN state has T=0. So the system emits X, leaving the NN in T=0 state.

So the initial state (before emission) must be the same as the final state because they're talking about the NN system after emission. Wait, no, perhaps the initial state is the NN plus X, but the problem says the NN are in a 1S0 state and emit X. So maybe the initial state is the NN bound system, and upon emission of X, the NN state becomes something else.

Wait, the problem says "consider a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state which emit a particle X". So the initial state is NN in 1S0, then they emit X, so the NN system must transition to some other state. The final NN state has T=0, which is given. So the question is about the allowed partial waves for X, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

The options are about the possible transitions. Each option has the initial state (1S0) going to a final state (like 7D1, 3S1, etc.) plus the emission of X (p, s, etc.). The lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. So the options are about the possible l (orbital angular momentum) of X after emission.

We need to find which partial wave is not permitted. So the options are A to D, each with different final states and X's orbital angular momentum.

The question mentions that we need to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

So I need to figure out for each option whether the transition is allowed based on angular momentum and parity.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Determine the parity of the initial and final states, and of X.

2. Use angular momentum conservation (the total angular momentum before and after emission must match), considering the angular momentum of X.

3. Use Pauli's statistics to determine the symmetry of the wavefunction.

Wait, but how does Pauli's statistics affect the allowed transitions here?

Wait, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So for the final NN state, T=0.

So T_final = 0. So 0 = S_NN + L_NN + 1 mod 2.

Which simplifies to S_NN + L_NN ≡ 1 mod 2.

Because 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 => (S + L) mod 2 = 1.

So S + L must be odd.

So in the final state, the spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN must sum to
