Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me take it slow and think aloud.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds mentioned. Let me go through each substance one by one.

First, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing xenon... Xenon usually is pretty inert, but maybe under certain conditions, it can react. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a strong fluorinating agent.

When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. The oF (I think that stands for the oxidation state of fluorine?) is 31.96%. Wait, oxidation state percentages? Or maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass. Wait, no, the oF is probably the oxidation state. But 31.96% doesn't make much sense for oxidation states because they are usually like +1, +2, etc. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2. Oh, that makes sense. So if A2 has an oF of 31.96% by mass, that would help determine its formula.

Wait, let me think: if A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, then A1 is likely a compound with higher fluorine content. For example, if A1 is YF3, it might decompose into YF2 and F2? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF4, which decomposes into YF3 and F2. Wait, but decomposing into F2 suggests that fluorine is being released, so it's breaking down into a less fluorinated compound and elemental fluorine.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about known fluorine compounds. Fluorine is usually in -1 oxidation state. So, for example, Y could be a metal, and the compounds would be YF, YF2, YF3, etc. But wait, fluorine is more electronegative, so it's more likely that Y is in a positive oxidation state.

Wait, but I remember that when some compounds decompose, they produce F2. For example, NaF decomposes under certain conditions? No, I think that's not right. Wait, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one plus F2. Alternatively, maybe it's a polyatomic fluoride.

Another approach: since A1 oxidizes xenon, which is a noble gas, perhaps A1 is a strong fluorinating agent. Xenon can form compounds like XeF2, XeF4, XeF6. So if A1 oxidizes xenon, maybe A1 is a fluorine-rich compound that can donate fluorine. Hmm.

Wait, but the main point is that A1's decomposition gives A2 and F2. Let me think about the decomposition reaction. Maybe it's something like 2 A1 → 2 A2 + F2. So the formula of A1 could be YF something that upon decomposition loses F, releasing F2.

Wait, let's suppose A1 is YF4. If it decomposes into YF2 and F2, the reaction would be YF4 → YF2 + F2. Let's check the stoichiometry. Let's balance that: 

YF4 → YF2 + F2. 

On the left, we have 4 F. On the right, 2 F (from YF2) + 2 F2 (which has 4 F). So total 4 F. That balances. So the equation is YF4 → YF2 + F2. 

So in that case, A1 is YF4, and A2 is YF2. Then, the percentage of fluorine in A2 would be (2*19)/(atomic mass of Y + 2*19) * 100. Oh, they gave that as 31.96%. So let's calculate that.

Let me write that as: (2 * 19) / (M_Y + 38) ) * 100 = 31.96%.

Simplify: 38 * 100 / (M_Y + 38) ) = 31.96.

So 3800 / (M_Y +38) ) = 31.96.

Multiply both sides by (M_Y +38): 3800 = 31.96 * (M_Y +38)

Compute 31.96 * (M_Y +38) = 3800.

Divide both sides by 31.96:

M_Y +38 = 3800 / 31.96 ≈ let me do the division. 3800 ÷ 32 ≈ 118.75. But 31.96 is close to 32, so M_Y +38 ≈ 118.75. So M_Y ≈ 118.75 -38 = 80.75. Hmm, approximately 81 g/mol.

What element has an atomic mass around 81? Let me think: Y is probably a metal. Let's see, elements near 81: Germanium is about 72, arsenic is around 75, selenium 79, bromine is about 80, but Y is likely a metal. Wait, 80 is close
