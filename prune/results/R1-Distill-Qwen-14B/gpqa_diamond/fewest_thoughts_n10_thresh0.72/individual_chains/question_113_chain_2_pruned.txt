Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let me break down the information given and see what I can figure out step by step.

First, the question gives me the IR, NMR, and Mass Spec data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data: a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups. The broadness suggests it's not a single peak, so maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid? But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, often around 2500-3300. The fact that it's broad here could fit either. But then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. The 1700 peak is a strong one, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be an conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a conjugated ketone, or perhaps an amide, but we don't have N in the options, so probably not an amide.

Wait, but if there's a peak at 1650, that might be a conjugated carbonyl, like maybe an ester (which typically have around 1730-1750 for the carbonyl, but sometimes lower if conjugated). Or maybe a conjugated ketone or an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached, like a benzaldehyde or something similar, but the 1700 is a strong peak.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like CH2=CH groups. So the compound probably has a double bond somewhere. Maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring. But wait, if it's an aromatic ring, the protons are usually more deshielded and show up in a certain region, but vinyl protons can be in the range of
