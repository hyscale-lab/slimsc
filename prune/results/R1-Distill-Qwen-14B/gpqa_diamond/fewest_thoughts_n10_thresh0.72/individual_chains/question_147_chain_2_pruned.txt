Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about an annihilation process. Hmm, the reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are given as A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. So, in annihilation processes, typically, matter and antimatter particles annihilate each other, converting their mass into energy, usually in the form of gamma rays. But here, instead of photons, they're producing particles A+ and A-. So, I guess each A has a certain mass, which is given as 300 MeV. Oh, wait, actually, the question says m_A c² is 300 MeV, so that's the rest mass energy of each A particle.

But wait, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton has a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV, I think. Because the proton is much heavier than the electron, so yeah, around 938 MeV. Similarly, the antiproton has the same mass as the proton because they're antiparticles. So each has 938 MeV/c².

So the initial system is a proton and an antiproton. The antiproton is moving slowly, so its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass. The proton is probably at rest? Or maybe not? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is initially at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some low velocity. So the total initial energy would be the sum of the energies of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, but if the proton is at rest, its energy is just m_p c². The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately m_p c² (since its kinetic energy is small), but maybe I should consider it more precisely.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, the energy and momentum must be conserved. So the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. So, four particles in the final state. But wait, in annihilation, usually energy is converted into other forms
