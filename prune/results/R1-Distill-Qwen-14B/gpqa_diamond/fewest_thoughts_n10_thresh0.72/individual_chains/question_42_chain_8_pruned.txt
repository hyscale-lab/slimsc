Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right approach. Let me read through it again.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question seems more about the orbital periods based on their equilibrium temperatures and masses.

The given data:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T2/T3 = 2.3, which means T3 is about 1/2.3 of T2.
- Mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M1/M2 = 1.15, which means M2 is M1 / 1.15.
- Similarly, the mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 1.35. So M2/M3 = 1.35, which means M3 = M2 / 1.35.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. So that should be the same for all, which probably means it cancels out in the equations.

The question asks by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So, we need to find P3/P1.

Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4)

Wait, but another version I've seen is Te = ( L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²) )^(1/4). Since albedo a is the same for all three, that term (1 - a) will be a constant factor across all planets. So when taking the ratio of temperatures, that factor cancels out.

Alternatively, the formula can be simplified as Te ∝ (L / D²)^(1/4), since (1 - a) is same for all.

But wait, the luminosity L of the star is related to the mass of the star, right? Oh, but in this problem, we don't have the mass of the star. Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path.

Wait, maybe I should think about the inverse square law for radiation. The flux from the star at a distance D is F = L/(4πD²). The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the balance between absorbed radiation and emitted radiation. So:

Incoming flux * (1 - a) / 4 = σ Te^4

So F = L/(4π D²), so:

(L/(4π D²)) * (1 - a) /4 = σ Te^4

So, (L (1 - a)) / (16 π D²) ) = σ Te^4

Taking the fourth root, Te = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

So, for each planet, Te is proportional to (L / D²)^(1/4) because the other factors are constants.

But wait, L is the luminosity of the host star. If all three planets are orbiting the same star, then L is the same for all. So, Te ∝ 1/D^(1/2). Because (L/D²)^(1/4) = (L^(1/4)) / (D^(2 * 1/4)) ) = L^(1/4) / D^(1/2). Since L is same for all, Te ∝ 1 / sqrt(D). So, the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance.

So, for each planet, Te is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So, Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

Alternatively, D ∝ 1/Te².

Wait, let's write it as D = k / Te², where k is a constant (since L and other factors are same for all planets). So, D is proportional to 1/Te².

Wait, no. Let me think again. If Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D), then D = (constant) / Te². Because, sqrt(D) = (constant) / Te → D = (constant)^2 / Te².

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

Te = (L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²))^(1/4)

So, Te^4 = L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²)

Rearranging, D² = L (1 - a) / (16 π σ Te^4 )

Taking square roots, D = sqrt( L (1 - a) / (16 π σ) ) / Te²

Because sqrt(D²) is D, and sqrt(1/Te^4) is 1/Te^2.

Since L, (1 - a), 16 π σ are all constants for the same star, we can say D ∝ 1/( Te^2 )

So, D is proportional to 1/Te².

So, for each planet, D ∝ 1/Te².

Now, the period of a planet is determined by Kepler's third law. The law states that (P²) / (a³) = 4π²/( G M ), where a is the semi-major axis (which is the same as D here since the orbits are circular), M is the mass of the star, and G is the gravitational constant.

But wait, in the case where
