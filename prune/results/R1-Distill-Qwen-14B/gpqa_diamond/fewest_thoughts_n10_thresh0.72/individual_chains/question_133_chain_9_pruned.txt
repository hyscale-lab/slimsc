Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. In that solution, there are two substances: 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, and we're asked to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution.

The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Hmm, so I think this is a buffer solution problem because we're mixing a weak acid with its conjugate base. KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (which is the bisulfate form?), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2-, which is the disulfate form. So they're different species in the phosphate buffer system.

Wait, no, the phosphate buffer system is H3PO4 and HPO4^2-. But here, we have KH2PO4 which is H2PO4^- (the acid form) and Na2HPO4 which is HPO4^2- (the conjugate base form). So this is a buffer solution between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in this case, H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2- (since H3PO4 -> H+ + H2PO4^-; H2PO4^- -> H+ + HPO4^2-; HPO4^2- -> H+ + PO4^3-).

Since we're looking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions, but I think that's the ion from the phosphate in solution. But wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think again.
