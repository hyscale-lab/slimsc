Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about a genetic experiment involving ligand-receptor pairs and their expression in mice. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup: the researcher identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're trying to understand their developmental fate by using a bicistronic vector. The vector is lox-Cre, which I remember is used for recombination, maybe for conditional expression or to knock out genes.

So, the vector has two open reading frames (ORFs): the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Wait, and each has a stop cassette with different lox sites. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe for expression in various tissues. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which is a internal ribosome entry site. IRES elements allow for the translation of a second ORF without a stop codon in between, but in this case, the ligand has a stop, so I'm a bit confused.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh, right, Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So using Cre would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed, right?

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct expression via Western blot. Actin is a loading control, so that's fine. Then the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice, which are hemizygous. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be active in neural crest cells, I think. The idea is that Cre would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But when they looked under the confocal, there was no green signal. Wait, eGFP is green, right? So the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed, but mCherry is red. Did they see red?

The options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that cause no eGFP signal? The expression is about whether the construct is expressed, not the function. So maybe this doesn't explain the result.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor is stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't get to the cell surface, so eGFP wouldn't be visible. But why would the receptors be stuck? If there's a problem with the construct, like a stop codon or incorrect reading frame, maybe. Or perhaps the eGFP is not properly tagged. But
