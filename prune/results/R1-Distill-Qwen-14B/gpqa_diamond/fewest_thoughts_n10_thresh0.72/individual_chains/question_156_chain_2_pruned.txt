Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says that a chemist performs two reactions. Both involve treating (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The question is about what the chemist would observe in each chromatogram.

I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation involves adding an oxygen atom across a double bond to form an epoxide. So, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide.

But wait, the configuration of the double bond (E or Z) should influence the product, right? Because the way the epoxide forms depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

In the first reaction, (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. Since mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. For an E-alkene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When epoxidized, the oxygen will form a bridge between the two carbons, and the configuration of the epoxide's substituents will depend on the starting geometry.

Similarly, in the second reaction, (Z)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. The substituents on the double bond are on the same side, so the epoxide formation would lead to a different stereochemistry in the product.

Wait, but wait. When epoxidizing, the product is a cyclic ether with two adjacent oxygen atoms. The addition is stereospecific, so the configuration of the double bond dictates the configuration of the epoxide.

But after that, both reactions are followed by aqueous acid. Oh, right! Epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening. So after the epoxide is formed, adding acid (like H3O+ or H2SO4) would cause the epoxide to open.

In acid, epoxides typically undergo ring-opening via a protonation mechanism. The epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. In an aqueous acidic solution, water is the nucleophile.

So for each epoxide, the ring opening would form a diol. The diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's structure and the mechanism.

Wait, but epoxide ring opening can lead to different diastereomers depending on the starting material. Let me think: for each starting alkene (E and Z), the epoxide formed would be different because of their stereochemistry.

But wait, wait again. For an E-alkene, the epoxide formed would have the two substituents on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. Similarly, the Z-alkene would form an epoxide with substituents on the same side. When each epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, would that lead to different products?

Wait, no. Because when the epoxide is opened in acid, it's a two-step process. First, protonation of the epoxide oxygen. Then, the ring opens, and the nucleophile (water) can attack either the less substituted or more substituted carbon, depending on the conditions.

Wait, no, wait. In acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides, the nucleophile tends to attack the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when the positive charge develops during the transition state. So the more substituted carbon becomes the carbocation-like center, making it more favorable for attack.

Wait, but in symmetric epoxides, it doesn't matter which carbon is attacked because both are the same. But oct-4-ene is symmetric in some cases?

Wait, no. Oct-4-ene, whether E or Z, is a symmetric molecule? Let's see: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3
