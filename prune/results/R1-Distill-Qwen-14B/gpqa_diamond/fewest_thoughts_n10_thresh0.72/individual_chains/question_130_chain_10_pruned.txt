Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the hydrogen clouds absorbing their light. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that quasars emit a lot of light, including the Lyman alpha line. The Lyman alpha wavelength is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, the question is about detecting this with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh right, because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light, so ground-based telescopes can't see that wavelength directly.

So when the quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength. If the cloud is moving away from us, there's a redshift. The observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms. The quasar's own emission is at 1216, but the absorption happens at a redshifted wavelength.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimum redshift where the absorption line can still be observed in optical light. Because if the redshift is too low, the absorption line would be in the UV, which ground telescopes can't see.

So how do I calculate this? I think it's about shifting the Lyman alpha wavelength into the optical range. Let me think about what wavelengths are considered optical. I think optical is roughly 400-700 nm, or about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So the absorption line needs to be in this range.

Let me denote the observed wavelength as lambda_obs. The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The redshift z is given by (lambda_obs / lambda_emit) - 1. So lambda_emit is 1216 Angstroms.

So for lambda_obs to be in optical, say 4000 Angstroms. Then z = (4000/1216) - 1. Let me compute that: 4000 divided by 1216 is approximately 3.288. Subtracting 1 gives zâ‰ˆ2.288. So around 2.288.

But wait, the lower limit would be when the absorption line just enters the optical. So the minimum redshift is when lambda_obs is the lower end of optical, maybe around 400 nm or 4000 Angstrom
