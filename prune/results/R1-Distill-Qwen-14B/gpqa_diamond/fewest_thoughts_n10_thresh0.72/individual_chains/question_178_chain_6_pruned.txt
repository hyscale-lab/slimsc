Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Lagrangian problem. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and determining if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let's think this through.

First, the given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in QFT, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension four because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c = 1). So, each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension four.

So, let's break down the components. The Lagrangian is an interaction term, so the dimension of each field and coupling constant will matter. Let me list the fields and their dimensions.

For Dirac fields ψ: Each ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order, so each ψ has dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2.

The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from the electromagnetic (or similar) field. The field A_mu has mass dimension 1, because the covariant derivative is ∂_mu + i e A_mu, and ∂_mu has dimension 1. So, F^{μν}, which is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, would also have dimension 2 (since each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so 1+1=2).

Now the σ_{μν} term is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're part of the spinor representation. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless, just like the gamma matrices themselves.

Putting it all together: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}

Each ψ̄ and ψ is dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. Then, σ_{μν} is dimensionless, so the product ψ̄ σψ contributes 3. Then F has dimension 2, so the entire term without κ would be 3 + 2 =5. 

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so κ must compensate for that. So κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, but wait: Let me double-check. The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each ψ is 3/2, so two ψ's (since ψ̄ is also 3/2) give 3/2 + 3/2 =3. Then σ is dimensionless, so that part is 3. F is 2. So 3 + 2 =5. So the whole term is 5. So to have the term in the Lagrangian be dimension 4, κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. So yes, [κ]_M is -1.

Now, the renormalizability part. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ 4. Wait, no: for a term in the Lagrangian, each term must have dimension ≤4. But wait, the coupling constants' dimensions also matter because they determine whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, the general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its mass dimension is ≤4. But each term comes with a coupling, and the coupling can't have a negative mass dimension because you can't have an infinite number of counterterms otherwise.

Wait, more accurately, a term in the Lagrangian has the form g φ^n, where g is
