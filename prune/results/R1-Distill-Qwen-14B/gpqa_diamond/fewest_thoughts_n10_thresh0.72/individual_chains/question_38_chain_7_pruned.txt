Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are typically formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds. But wait, the question is about a specific reaction here.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me try to draw that structure. So, the molecule has a positively charged ethanaminium group, which probably means it's an ammonium ion. The substituents are N-methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent on the double bond at position 2. So the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3 attached to a nitrogen, which is also attached to a methyl group and the positive charge. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)C=CH2 attached to N, but I'm a bit confused.

The reaction is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + A â†’ B. The options give different reagents and products. I need to figure out what A is and what B is.

Wait, the reaction steps in the options involve LDA, DME, CH3CH2I, and H3O+. Enamine reactions usually involve deprotonation, alkylation, and then hydrolysis. Oh right! The process is called the Stork en
