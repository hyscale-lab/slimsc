Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, waitâ€”hold on, that doesn't look like a normalized vector. Oh, because in quantum mechanics, states are typically represented as unit vectors. But wait, let me check: the length here would be sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state vector is not normalized. Hmm, but maybe in the context of the problem, it's given as a state, and perhaps we should normalize it first before proceeding. Or maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized? Hmm, I'll have to keep that in mind.

But wait, the problem says, "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." So maybe I need to normalize it. Let me calculate the normalization factor. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1). So the actual state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Now, the operators for the observables P and Q are given. Let me write them down.

Operator P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, so Q is a diagonal matrix. Its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. Because diagonal matrices have their diagonal elements as eigenvalues. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1
