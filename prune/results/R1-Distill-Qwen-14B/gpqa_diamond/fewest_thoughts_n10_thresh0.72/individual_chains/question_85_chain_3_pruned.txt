Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. Both detection methods, transit and radial velocity, have found them. The star's details are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, Teff 6300 K. Then there are the planets: Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses, radius 1.3 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and same albedo.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. So I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I think is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. Oh wait, since both have same albedo, that part cancels out in the ratio.

Wait, no, the formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming no greenhouse effect and blackbody emission) is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. Since A is same for both, (1-A) is same, so when taking the ratio, that factor cancels.

So I need to find the ratio T1_eq / T2_eq. Which would be sqrt( R1/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R2/(2a2) ) ), because the other factors are same. Wait, sqrt(R/(2a)) is the same as sqrt(R/(a)) multiplied by sqrt(1/2), but that's a common factor so it cancels in the ratio.

Wait, wait. Let me write the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) ) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. So, the ratio T1/T2 is [ (R1/(2a1) )/( R2/(2a2) ) ]^0.5. The 2s cancel out, so it becomes sqrt( (R1 * a2) / (R2 * a1) ) ).

So I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of the two planets, because the question gives me the Doppler shifts which I can relate to the masses and orbital periods. Wait, Doppler method gives the mass of the planet, but more importantly, the velocity of the star. The RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

Wait, the question gives the shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So these are the Doppler shifts caused by the star's movement due to each planet.

Doppler shift Δλ / λ = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. So v = (Δλ / λ) * c.

Wait, for Planet1, Δλ is 0.03 Å, and λ
