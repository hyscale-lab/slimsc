Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue and given state vector. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means we're working in the z-basis.

So, the first thing I need to recall is how to calculate the uncertainty of an operator. The formula for uncertainty is ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to compute the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So, if I remember correctly, the expectation value of P_x is just the eigenvalue, which in this case is -ħ. But we're asked about P_z, so I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ in the given state.

The given state is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that out as a vector:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, this state is already expressed in the z-basis. That should make things easier because then the components directly correspond to the amplitudes in the z-basis.

So, the first step is to compute ⟨P_z⟩. P_z is a diagonal matrix because it's diagonal in the z-basis. Let me look at the matrix form of P_z given in the problem.

The P_z matrix is:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So, the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the three basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ respectively.

Now, the expectation value ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the sum of each component squared times the corresponding eigenvalue.

Let me compute that. The state vector has components a= -1/2, b=1/√2, c= -1/2.

So, |a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, |b|^2 is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, and |c|^2 is 1/4.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ)
= (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)
= (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

Hmmm, that's interesting. So the expectation of P_z is zero. Now, moving on to ⟨P_z²⟩.

Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of the diagonal elements. So the matrix P_z² will have diagonal entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 = ħ^2, 0, ħ^2.

Wait no, let me compute it correctly. The diagonal elements of P_z are ħ, 0, -ħ. So P_z squared would be (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

Wait, no. The matrix P_z squared is P_z multiplied by itself, but since P_z is diagonal, each element is the square of the original elements.

So the matrix will be:

Row 1: ħ^2, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, ħ^2

So, the diagonal entries are (ħ², 0, ħ²). So when I compute ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the sum of |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ²).

So that's (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*
