Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction involves some specific reagents and then an acidic workup. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. I need to find out how many peaks appear in each chromatogram.

Let me break it down. First, I'll tackle each reaction separately to determine the products formed.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, in this reaction, the ketone group at position 3 of hexan-3-one would be reduced. Let's visualize the structure.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3 ?

Wait, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3. So, the 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is the second carbon from the end. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-(C=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe I should write it as:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

O

CH2CH2-C-O-CH2CH2CH3? No, no, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, the numbering is from the other end? Let me get the structure right.

Hexan-3-one has the ketone group on carbon 3. So the carbon chain is 6 carbons: 1, 2, 3 (with ketone), 4, 5, 6.

So, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would have a methoxy group
