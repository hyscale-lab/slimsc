Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about electron microscopy and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, Mike designed a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 1e-9 Torr. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment because they can interfere with the electron beam. But despite that, some gas particles remainedâ€”so the mass spectrometer detected them.

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules under the vacuum conditions. Mean free path (lambda) depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment. He found this value to be lambda1. But then, when he started the electron beam, he noticed something different. The mean free path changed to lambda2, even though the temperature stayed the same. So why did this happen?

Wait, the mean free path in a gas is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula for mean free path is lambda = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*pi*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the mean diameter of the molecules, and P is the pressure. But wait, another way to write it is lambda = (1)/(sqrt(2)*n*pi*d^2), where n is the number density. Oh right, because P = n*k*T. So higher pressure (more n) would mean shorter mean free path.

But in this scenario, Mike's setup is under ultra-high vacuum. So the pressure is already very low, meaning n is very low, so lambda1 is large. But when the electron beam is on, maybe something else happens.

Hmm, the electron beam emits high-energy electrons. These electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize or become excited. Oh wait, or maybe the electrons collide with the gas molecules more frequently. If the gas is ionized, the ions might have a different effective diameter or perhaps the presence of charges could affect the mean free path. Maybe the ions interact more strongly with each other or with the electrons, altering the collision dynamics.

Wait, but the mean free path in the original case (lambda1) was
