Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I'll take it slow.

So the question is about organic chemistry reactions, specifically involving dicarboxylic acids, their dehydration to anhydrides, and then a reaction with a cyclopentadiene. Then, the products are analyzed using NMR spectroscopy, particularly NOESY.

First, let's break down the information given.

The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it undergoes dehydration, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and 13C has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm.

Wait, 1H NMR at 7 ppm is probably an aromatic proton, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group? No, wait, 7 ppm is more likely to be an aromatic proton, but let's think. Anhydrides typically have carbonyl groups. In 13C NMR, the carbonyls would appear around 165-220 ppm. So 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl from the anhydride. The 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, maybe a double bond or an spÂ² hybridized carbon.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. If it's an anhydride from a cis-dicarboxylic acid, maybe the structure is a cyclic anhydride. So for example, if the dicarboxylic acid is something like cis-butenedioic acid, dehydration would form a cyclic anhydride, maybe a five-membered ring. So the structure would have two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen, in a ring.

But then the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Hmm. So maybe that's a proton adjacent to the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is symmetric, and all the non-carbonyl protons are equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak. So if the anhyd
