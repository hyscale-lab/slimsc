Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows some anomalies. The main point is that for one alpha-proton, there are two peaks. Both have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. The coupling pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling, so it's not like they're splitting each other. 

Then, looking at LC-MS, the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spec, which is expected for the target molecule. Hmm.

So, what's going on here? Let me think about possible explanations.

First, the NMR issue. Two peaks for the same proton. If the shifts are similar, maybe they're from different environments but similar. So, why would that happen? Possible reasons include diastereomers, enantiomers, or some sort of coupling during synthesis. 

In the case of diastereomers, each would have different environments. For example, if the molecule has a stereocenter, and another isomer exists with a different configuration, the alpha protons would be in different environments, leading to different NMR shifts. But if that's the case, would the integrals add up to 1H? If it's a diastereomeric pair (like two diastereomers each with the same number of alpha protons), then each would contribute their own set of peaks. But wait, the integrals add up to 1H, suggesting there are two sets of peaks each integrating to 0.5H? No, the question says together they integrate to 1H, which is correct because each is a single proton. So in a diastereomeric mixture, each would have their own set of peaks. So maybe that's a possibility.

Enantiomers, on the other hand, would have identical NMR shifts because they are mirror images. So each would give the same peak, but if the mixture is racemic, you wouldn't see two separate peaks because enantiomers can't be distinguished by regular NMR (they don't split each other as they are mirror images). Unless there's some kind of diastereotopic effect, but I don't think that's the case here. So the NMR wouldn't split into two for enantiomers.

Wait, but the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So if the molecule had two different diastereomers, each with their own environment for the alpha proton, you would see two separate peaks with different shifts. Or if there's some other kind of splitting.

Another possibility is that there's a coupling during an amide bond formation. The option C says 'double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction. Hmm. I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Maybe if there was a double bond formed, or some other coupling that leads to two sets of protons? I'm not too clear on that.

The LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So same mass, same retention time? Well, no, same mass but same retention time would imply same compound, but the peaks are at different retention times. So
