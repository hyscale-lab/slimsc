Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, so we're focusing just on the orbital part. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Oh wait, the notation is |l1, l2, l, m>, right? So l1 and l2 are the orbital quantum numbers for each electron. Since each is a p orbital, their l values are 1 each. 

The total angular momentum quantum number is l, which is 2 here. And m is -1. So the state is a combination of the individual angular momenta adding up to l=2 with m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need to find the probability that both measurements yield eigenvalues of -ħ. 

Wait, the eigenvalues for Lz are m times ħ, right? So for each electron, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1 because l=1. So for the first electron, L1z can be +ħ, 0, or -ħ. Similarly for the second electron, L2z can be the same.

But wait, the problem is about the joint probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So each measurement would yield -ħ, meaning m1=-1 and m2=-1. So the product of their individual probabilities would be the joint probability, assuming they are independent. But wait, no, because in quantum mechanics, when you have a state with a specific total m, the individual m's are not independent. The total m is the sum of the individual m's.

So let's think about the state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. The state represents all possible combinations of m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = m = -1. So m1 can be 0 and m2=-1, or m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=1 and m2=-2—but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2 is 1. So the possible pairs are (m1, m2) = (0, -1) and (-1, 0). Because m1 can be -1, 0, 1, and m2 can be -1, 0, 1. So adding to m= -1, the only possible pairs are:

m1=0, m2=-1: 0 + (-1) = -1.

m1=-1, m2=0: (-1) + 0 = -1.

m1=1, m2=-2: but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can't be less than -1. So only two possibilities: (0,-1) and (-1,0).

Wait, but wait, in the coupled state |l=2, m=-1>, how is it expressed in terms of the product states |m1, m2>? I think the state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is a combination of all possible |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the state is a linear combination of the basis states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the state is a sum over all m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1.

But what are the coefficients? For two p orbitals adding to l=2, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients would apply. The state |l=2, m=-1> would be a combination of |m1=0, m2=-1> and |m1=-1, m2=0>, right?

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the coefficients. Let me think about the possible combinations. Each term in the expansion must have m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) are (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, -2) but the last is invalid because m2 can't be -2. So only two terms.

So the state |2, -1> is given by a linear combination of |1,0> (for electron 1 in m1=0 and electron 2 in m2=-1) and |0,1> (for electron 1 in m1=-1 and electron 2 in m2=0).

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct. The |m1, m2> states are for each electron. So when you have two electrons, each with m1 and m2, the combined state is |m1, m2>, and the |l=2, m=-1> state is a linear combination of these where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the state is a sum of |m1, m2> for all m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = -1. The actual coefficients depend on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. But for the purpose of finding probabilities, maybe I don't need the exact coefficients because I can figure out the possible terms.

But wait, the question is about the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. That would mean m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. So the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> would have m1 + m2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2, which is not equal to the total m = -1. So this state is not part of the |l=2, m=-1> state. Therefore, the coefficient for |m1=-1, m2=-1> in |l=2, m=-1> is zero.

Wait, that's right. Because |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of terms where m1 + m2 =-1. So |m1=-1, m2=-1> would give m = -2, which is not part of the state we have. Therefore, the amplitude for this term is zero. So the probability is zero.

Wait, but wait another thought. The state |l=2, m=-1> is a specific state. The possible m1 and m2 in the expansion must sum to -1. So in the expansion, the only possible m1 and m2 pairs are (0, -1) and (-1, 0). There's no term where both m1 and m2 are -1 because that would require m
