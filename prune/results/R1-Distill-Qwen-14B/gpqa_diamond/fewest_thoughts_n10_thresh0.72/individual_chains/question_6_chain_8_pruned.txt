Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, so it's a function of r and θ. The particle has mass m and is moving in two dimensions. The question is asking for the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in two-dimensional systems, the potential can often be separated into radial and angular parts. Radial means depending on r, and angular on θ. So maybe this potential can be broken down that way. Let me think about how.

The given potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out r²: V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos^2θ ]. So that's (k/2) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to separate the terms.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be written as two terms: one that depends only on r, and another that depends on r and θ. Let me write it as V(r,θ) = V1(r) + V2(r,θ), where V1(r) = (1/2)k r² and V2(r,θ) = (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the potential as being separable into a function of r and a function of θ. Wait, but the way it's written, both terms have r² and cosθ squared. Hmm.

Let me think about the form of the potential. The first term is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Cos^2θ can be written using a double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting
