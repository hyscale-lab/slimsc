Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, it's about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, right? And in this case, both photons have the same energy. Interesting.

So, the setup: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factors... I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But perhaps I don't need to calculate the actual velocities here. Maybe I can work with the energies and momenta in terms of gamma.

Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their velocities are in opposite directions. When they annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum here.

Let me think about their rest masses. Both an electron and a positron have the same rest mass, m_e. So the total rest energy is 2*m_e*c², but wait, each has their own kinetic energy plus rest energy. Because they're moving, their total energies are gamma times m_e c squared.

So electron's energy: gamma_e * m_e c². Similarly, the positron's energy is gamma_p * m_e c². Since gamma_e is 4 and gamma_p is 2, their energies are 4 m_e c² and 2 m_e c², respectively.

But wait, the electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their momenta are in opposite directions. The positron has a lower gamma, so its momentum might be less than the electron's? Let me see.

Momentum p is gamma m v. Alternatively, since gamma m c = E/c² * v. Hmm, another approach: for each particle, their relativistic momentum can be found as p = gamma * m_e
