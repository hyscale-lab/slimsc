Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here: L_int equals kappa times psi bar sigma_mu nu psi F^{mu nu}. And sigma_mu nu is defined as (i/2) times [gamma_mu, gamma_nu]. Hmm, I need to find the mass dimension of kappa and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant can be found by ensuring the Lagrangian is dimensionless. Because in natural units where c=hbar=1, the action is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of four because the integral over d^4x is dimensionless.

So for the Lagrangian term, each term (like L_int here) must have a mass dimension of 4. Let me break down the components.

The term is kappa * psi_bar * sigma_mu nu * psi * F^{mu nu}.

First, I need to find the dimensions of each part. Let's see:

- psi is a spinor. Fermions like electrons have mass dimension 3/2. So psi has [psi] = 3/2. Then psi_bar is the same, since it's just the adjoint, so also 3/2.

What about sigma_mu nu? Sigma is defined in terms of gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices, right? So sigma_mu nu is (i/2)[gamma_mu, gamma_nu], which is a commutator of dimensionless objects. So sigma is dimensionless. So [sigma] = 0.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like electromagnetism. The photon field A_mu has mass dimension 1. The field strength F is the derivative of A plus terms involving A squared. So each derivative gives dimension 1, so F has [F] = 2. Because derivatives are mass dimension 1, and A is 1, so F is 2.

Now putting it all together: the term is kappa multiplied by (psi_bar) (sigma) (psi) (F). So their dimensions are:

kappa * [psi]^2 * [sigma] * [F].

Wait, dimensions: [kappa] * [psi]^2 (since psi_bar and psi, two of them) * [sigma] (which is 0) * [F].

So [kappa] * (3/2 + 3/2) * 0 * 2.

Wait, wait, let's compute each part:

psi_bar has [3/2], psi has [3/2], so together they contribute 3. Because 3/2 +3/2=3.

sigma_mu nu: dimensionless, so 0.

F^{mu nu}: dimension 2.

So the product is [kappa] * 3 * 0 * 2? No, wait no. Wait, the product of the fields is:

psi_bar (3/2) * sigma (0) * psi (3/2) * F (2) = 3/2 +3/2 +0 + 2 = 3 + 2=5. So [kappa] *5 must equal 4, because the term is in the Lagrangian which has dimension 4.

Wait, wait, the Lagrangian term is L = kappa * ... So the product of the fields and kappa must be dimension 4.

So [kappa] * [ ... ] =4.

The ... part is (psi_bar sigma psi F).

Which is [psi_bar][psi][F] * [sigma], which is (3/2)(3/2)(2)(0) = (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4)*2=9/2=4.5.

Wait, wait, no. Let me get this straight. Each psi is 3/2, so [psi_bar][psi] is (3/2)*(3/2)=9/4. Then F is 2, and sigma is 0.

So the total [psi_bar sigma psi F] is (9/4) * 2 * 0? No, wait. Wait, sigma is the sigma_mu nu tensor, which is a product of gamma matrices, but in terms of mass dimension, it's dimensionless. So when you take the product psi_bar sigma psi, that's [psi]^2 * [sigma] = (3/2)^2 * 0= (9/4)*0=0? That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me think.

No, sigma is a product of gamma matrices, but in terms of mass dimension, it's just a number (since gamma matrices are dimensionless). So sigma_mu nu is a tensor with structure but dimensionless.

So the term psi_bar sigma_mu nu psi is a scalar (in the sense of Lorentz indices) and its dimension is [psi_bar][psi], since sigma is dimensionless. So [psi_bar][psi] is (3/2)^2 =9/4.

Then F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

So the entire term is [kappa] * [9/4] * [2] = [kappa] * 9/4 * 2 = [kappa] * (9/2).

Wait, no, because the term is [kappa] multiplied by (psi_bar sigma psi F) which has dimensions (9/4) * 2 =9/2.

Because [psi]^2 is (3/2)^2=9/4, and F is 2. So 9/4 * 2 =9/2.

So [kappa] * (9/2) must equal 4, because the Lagrangian term has mass dimension 4.

So [kappa] = 4 / (9/2) )= 4 * (2/9) )= 8/9. Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me try again.

Each psi is dimension 3/2. So psi_bar and psi together are 3/2 +3/2=3.

Sigma is dimensionless (0), so the psi terms with sigma are [psi_bar sigma psi] =3.

Then F^{mu nu} is 2. So the product (psi_bar sigma psi) F is 3 +2=5.

So the entire term is kappa *5.

So the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4, so [kappa] *5=4 → [kappa]=4/5. But wait, none of the options have 4/5. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the dimensions. Let's recheck.

The Lagrangian term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each field's dimension:

ψ: 3/2.

σ_{μν}: 0.

F^{μν}: 2.

So the term is κ multiplied by:

ψ̄ (3/2) * σ (0) * ψ (3/2) * F (2).

So the product of the fields is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2.

So κ * (9/2) must be dimension 4.

So [κ] = 4 * (2/9) )= 8/9 ≈ 0.888.

But the options are about whether κ has dimension -1 or 1.

Wait, that's a problem. Because 8/9 is approximately 0.89, which isn't close to 1 or -1. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the dimensions of F^{mu nu}. Let me think. F is the field strength, which is ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu + g A_mu A_nu. Each term must have the same dimension. A_mu is a gauge field, which for electromagnetism has dimension 1. So ∂_mu A_nu is dimension 1+1=2. Similarly, A_mu A_nu is 1+1=2. So F has dimension 2. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the dimension of psi_bar sigma psi? Wait, sigma_{mu nu} is a tensor made from gamma matrices. Gamma matrices are dimensionless, so sigma is dimensionless. So [psi_bar sigma psi] is [psi]^2 = (3/2)^2=9/4.

Then F is 2, so 9/4 * 2=9/2.

So L_int term is [kappa] * (9/2) =4 → [kappa] =4 * 2/9 =8/9.

But none of the options have 8/9. So this suggests perhaps I'm miscalculating the dimensions.

Wait another angle: maybe the term is dimensionally [kappa] * [psi]^2 [F] [sigma]?

But sigma is dimensionless, so it's [kappa] * (3/2)^2 * 2 = [kappa] * (9/4 * 2)= [kappa] *9/2=4.

So same as before. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is a product of four components: psi, psi, F, and sigma. Wait, sigma is antisymmetric, but in terms of dimensions, it's still a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps the Lagrangian term should have dimension 4. So:

Each factor: psi is 3/2, so two psis give 3. F is 2. So the product is 3 +2=5.

So [kappa] *5 =4 → [kappa]=4/5.

But the options don't have that. So where am I wrong?

Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of fields. Let's see. The Lagrangian term is:

kappa * psi_bar * sigma_mu nu * psi * F^{mu nu}.

So that's four factors: psi_bar (3/2), sigma (0), psi (3/2), F (2).

So the product is 3/2 +3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5.

So [kappa] *5=4 → [kappa]=4/5=0.8.

Hmm, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dimension of F. Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again about the field strength tensor. For a non-Abelian gauge field, like Yang-Mills, the field strength includes terms with the structure constants or gauge couplings. But in this case, the Lagrangian is written as F^{mu nu}, which for electromagnetism is F_{EM}^{mu nu}, which has dimension 2. So that part is correct.

Wait another thing: perhaps the term is not renormalizable if the coupling has a certain dimension. Wait, the theory is renormalizable only if the coupling's dimension is ≥0. Because in general, the mass dimension of the coupling constant determines renormalizability. For a term like L = g φ^n, the dimension [g] is 4 -n [φ]. For the theory to be renormalizable, [g] ≥0, so 4 -n [d] ≥0, where [d] is the dimension of φ.

In this case, our coupling is κ, and the term in the Lagrangian is of the form κ (ψ̄ σ F ψ). So the term is like κ (ψ^2 F). So the dimension of the term is [κ] + 2*[ψ] + [F].

Wait, wait, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension [L] =4. So:

[kappa] + 2*(3/2) + [F] =4.

But [F] is 2. So [kappa] +3 + 2 =4 → [kappa] +5=4 → [kappa]=-1.

Ah! I see. Wait, because [Lagrangian term]=4, so each term must have dimension 4. So the sum of the dimensions of the coupling and the fields must equal 4.

So the term is: κ * ψ^2 * F.

So [κ] + 2*(3/2) + [F] =4.

Which is [κ] +3 +2=4 → [κ]= -1.

So [kappa]=-1.

So the first part is that [kappa]=-1.

Now, the next question: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling. In general, a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if the coupling's dimension is greater than or equal to zero. Because in terms of perturbation theory, higher-dimensional couplings would lead to higher-order divergences that can't be absorbed by the same renormalization constants.

In this case, [kappa]=-1. So [kappa] is negative. Which suggests that the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, let me think. The interaction term is of the form κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Each such term is of higher dimension if [kappa] is negative.

Wait, what's the general rule? The mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥0 for the term to be renormalizable.

Wait, let me recall: The Yang-Mills term in the Lagrangian is F^2, which has a coupling (like g^2) that is dimensionless, so the theory is renormalizable. Wait, no. Wait, wait, for the Yang-Mills term, the Lagrangian is (1/4) F^a_{mu nu} F^{a mu nu}, so each F has dimension 2. So two F's give dimension 4, so the term has dimension 4. So the coupling is 1/4, which is dimensionless. So it's renormalizable.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let's compute the dimension of the term without the coupling. The term is ψ̄ σ F ψ. [ψ̄] is 3/2, σ is 0, F is 2. So 3/2 +0 +2 +3/2= 3 +2=5. So the term without coupling has dimension 5, which is higher than 4. So the coupling must have [kappa]=-1 to make the entire term have dimension 4.

Now, for renormalizability: interactions must have coupling constants with non-negative mass dimension. Because in a renormalizable theory, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0 because higher dimensions would require higher order counterterms, which aren't available.

So since [kappa]=-1 <0, the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [kappa]=-1, theory not renormalizable. So looking at the options:

Option C says [kappa]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. So option C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} \left[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu\right]$, and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[ \psi ] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ also has mass dimension $[ \bar{\psi} ] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[ F ] = 2$.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless, $[ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ] = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension 4, as all terms in the Lagrangian are dimensionless in natural units. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is a product of $\kappa$, $\bar{\psi}$, $\psi$, $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$, and $F^{\mu\nu}$. Their combined mass dimension is:

\[
[ \kappa ] + [ \bar{\psi} ] + [ \psi ] + [ \sigma_{\mu\nu} ] + [ F ] = [ \kappa ] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
[ \kappa ] + 3 + 2 = 4 \implies [ \kappa ] = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

Thus, the mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[ \kappa ]_M = -1$.

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[ \kappa ]_M = -1$, which is negative. Since the coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
