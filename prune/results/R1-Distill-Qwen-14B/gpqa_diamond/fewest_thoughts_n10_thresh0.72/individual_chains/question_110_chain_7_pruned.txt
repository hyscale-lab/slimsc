Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The key points are the brightness limitations of each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17, while HIRES can go up to 16. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 by HIRES. But wait, waitâ€”wait, no, I think I have this backwards. Oh right, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star with V magnitude less than 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and less than 16 by HIRES. Because higher magnitude means fainter. So HIRES can only see stars brighter than 16 mag, which is a smaller range than ESPRESSO's 17.

So the star must be observable by both, meaning its apparent V magnitude must be less than 16 mag since HIRES can't see beyond that. Because if a star is fainter than 16 mag, HIRES can't detect it, but ESPRESSO can. But for both, it has to be brighter than the higher limit. Wait, no. Let me clarify: for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be within the range that both can detect. So it
