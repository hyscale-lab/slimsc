Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see... The question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu. The setup is that the magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. Then, it's suddenly turned off and another field along +Y is turned on, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have magnetic moments related to their spin. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz, right? Where Sz is the spin component in the z-direction.

So initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin will align with this field because the energy is minimized when mu is aligned with B. But then the field is turned off and a new field along Y is applied. I guess when the field changes, the spin precesses around the new field direction.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. So when the field is along Y, the Zeeman effect comes into play. The Hamiltonian in a magnetic field B along Y would be something like H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and B is along Y, which is the S_y direction. Oh wait, no, the magnetic field is along Y, so the magnetic moment would interact with it. So the Hamiltonian should be proportional to S_y.

Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is H = -mu · B. Since B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

In quantum mechanics, the energy levels for spin-1/2 in a magnetic field along Y would be proportional to S_y. The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2 times some gamma and B factors. Wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so the energy levels would be E = -gamma B (± ħ/2) * something. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. The energy is H = -mu · B. Since mu = gamma S, and B is along Y, this becomes H = -gamma B S_y. So the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the energies would be E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). Wait, because H = -gamma B S_y, so E = -gamma B (s_y), where s_y is ± ħ/2.

Wait, wait, maybe I should get the eigenvalues correctly. Let me compute the eigenvalues of H. Since S_y |±y> = ± ħ/2 |±y>,

H |±y> = -gamma B (S_y) |±y> = -gamma B (± ħ/2) |±y> 

So the eigenenergies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). Or wait, maybe I'm getting a sign wrong. Because mu is along the spin direction, so when the field is along Y, the energy depends on the dot product. So when the spin is along +Y, the energy is lower if mu is aligned with B, which would make H negative. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the Zeeman effect.

But regardless, the point is that the energy eigenstates are the spin states in the Y direction. The initial state is aligned with Z, so it's a superposition of |+y> and |-y> states.

Wait, initial state before the field changes: the particle is in an eigenstate of S_z, either |+z> or |-z>, because the magnetic field was along Z. Let's say it's in the state |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to Y, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the system is now in a superposition of |+y> and |-y> states. The time evolution will cause the state to change, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of S_z.

Okay, so the system is in a state that's a combination of the energy eigenstates. Let me express |+z> in terms of the |+y> and |-y> basis. The state |+z> can be written as a linear combination of |+y> and |-y>. 

I remember that the eigenstates of S_z and S_y are related by a rotation. Specifically, a rotation of 90 degrees around the x-axis would take the z-axis to the y-axis. The rotation operator for spin-1/2 is R = exp(-i theta S_x / ħ). For theta = pi/2, R = exp(-i (pi/2) S_x / ħ ). 

The |+z> state can be written as R |+y> or something like that. Alternatively, I think the transformation is:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, no, I think the correct expansion is |+z> = (|+y> + i |−y> ) / sqrt(2), because of the rotation phase factors. Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact expression.

The general formula for rotation between spin states is:

|+z> = cos(theta/2) |+y> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |−y> 

But if the rotation is around the x-axis by 90 degrees, then theta=pi/2, and phi=pi/2 perhaps? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the axes. Alternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to look up the relation between the eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Pauli matrices. The spin states can be represented as vectors. For spin-1/2, the |+y> state can be written as (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2), perhaps. Wait, let me think.

The eigenstates of S_x are (|+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) and (|+z> - |−z> ) / sqrt(2). Similarly, I think the eigenstates of S_y can be written using a rotation of 90 degrees around x. The eigenstates of S_y are (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2) and (|+z> - i |−z> ) / sqrt(2). So that would mean:

|+y> = (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

and 

|−y> = (|+z> - i |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

So, solving for |+z> in terms of |+y> and |−y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2) * (1/i) ? No, wait, let me compute.

Wait, if |+y> = [ |+z> + i |−z> ] / sqrt(2),

and |−y> = [ |+z> - i |−z> ] / sqrt(2),

then adding |+y> and |−y> gives [2 |+z> ] / sqrt(2), so |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, no, wait:

If I add |+y> and |−y>, it's [ |+z> + i |−z> + |+z> - i |−z> ] / sqrt(2) 

= [ 2 |+z> ] / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) |+z> 

So |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, that can't be right because when I add |+y> and |−y>, the imaginary terms cancel. So |+z> would be (|+y> + |−y> )/(2) * sqrt(2) )? Wait, maybe I should recompute.

Wait, |+y> = (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2),

|−y> = (|+z> - i |−z> ) / sqrt(2).

So |+y> + |−y> = [ 2 |+z> ] / sqrt(2) 

= sqrt(2) |+z> 

Therefore, |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2)

So the initial state is |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2). 

Wait, but that seems a bit off because |+y> and |−y> are orthogonal, so their sum would have a norm of sqrt( (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 ) = 1. So yes, that works.

But wait, in our case, the initial state is |+z>, and after the field changes to Y, the system is in this |+z> state, which is a superposition of |+y> and |−y>, the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

So the state after the switch is:

|psi(0)> = |+z> = (|+y> + |−y> ) / sqrt(2)

Because the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y, the time evolution of each eigenstate |+y> and |−y> is given by a phase factor.

The time-dependent state is:

|psi(t)> = e^{-i H t / ħ} |psi(0)>

But H |+y> = E_+ |+y>, and H |−y> = E_- |−y>

So,

|psi(t)> = e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} (|+y> / sqrt(2)) + e^{-i E_- t / ħ} (|−y> / sqrt(2))

What are E_+ and E_-? 

Earlier, I thought the energies are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2). Wait, let me check.

H = - gamma B S_y

The eigenvalues of S_y are ± ħ/2.

So E_+ = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) = - gamma B ħ / 2

E_- = (-gamma B) * (- ħ/2) = gamma B ħ / 2

So E_+ = - (gamma B ħ ) / 2,

E_- = (gamma B ħ ) / 2

So the time evolution is:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{-i (-gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ } |+y> + e^{-i (gamma B ħ / 2 ) t / ħ } |−y> ] / sqrt(2)

Simplify exponents:

The exponent for the first term is (-i) * [ (-gamma B ħ t ) / (2 ħ) ) ]

= (-i) * [ (-gamma B t ) / 2 ]

= i (gamma B t ) / 2 

The exponent for the second term is (-i) * (gamma B ħ t )/(2 ħ )

= (-i) * (gamma B t ) / 2 

So,

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t / 2 } |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t / 2 } |−y> ] / sqrt(2)

Now, we need to find the expectation value of Sz, which is the z-component of the spin.

The operator Sz in the basis of |+y> and |−y> can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |−z> states, then compute <Sz>.

Alternatively, let's compute <Sz> as the expectation value in the state |psi(t)>.

Sz is (ħ/2) sigma_z in the computational basis. But perhaps I can compute it directly.

Express |psi(t)> in terms of |+z> and |−z>:

We have from earlier, |+y> = (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

|−y> = (|+z> - i |−z> ) / sqrt(2)

So substituting into |psi(t)>:

|psi(t)> = [ e^{i gamma B t / 2} (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t / 2} (|+z> -i |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, no. Wait, |psi(t)> is [ e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |−y> ] / sqrt(2)

Substituting |+y> and |−y>:

= [ e^{i gamma B t/2} * (|+z> + i |−z> ) / sqrt(2) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} * (|+z> - i |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2) from the substitution:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + i |−z> ) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - i |−z> )) / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2)

Which is equal to [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + i |−z> ) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - i |−z> ) ] / (2)

Now, expanding that:

= [ |+z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) + i |−z> ( e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} ) ] / 2

Using Euler's formula: e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ, and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ.

So,

= [ |+z> (2 cos( gamma B t /2 )) + i |−z> (2i sin( gamma B t /2 )) ] / 2

Simplify:

= [ |+z> cos( gamma B t /2 ) + i * (i) |−z> sin( gamma B t /2 ) ] / 1 

Because 2/2=1, and 2i/2 =i.

Wait, wait, let's compute each term:

The first term: (2 cos( ... )) /2 => cos(...)

The second term: i |−z> (2i sin(...)) / 2 

= i * 2i sin(...) |−z> / 2 

= i^2 (sin(...)) |−z>

i^2 = -1.

So the second term becomes: - sin(...) |−z>

So overall,

|psi(t)> = [ |+z> cos( gamma B t /2 ) - |−z> sin( gamma B t /2 ) ] / 1

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation:

From the previous step:

= [ |+z> (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) + i |−z> (e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}) ] / 2, where θ = gamma B t/2

=> [ |+z> (2 cosθ) ) + i |−z> (2i sinθ) ] /2

= [ |+z> cosθ + i |−z> (i sinθ) ] 

Because 2/2=1, and 2i/2= i.

i * i = -1, so:

= |+z> cosθ - |−z> sinθ

So,

|psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z> 

where theta = (gamma B t)/2

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <Sz> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

Since S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |−z> = (-ħ/2) |−z>.

So,

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta) < +z | - sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |−z> ]

= cos(theta)^2 (ħ/2) + sin(theta)^2 ( - ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

= (ħ/2) cos( 2 theta )

Because cos^2 - sin^2 = cos 2 theta.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( 2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t)/2, so 2 theta is gamma B t.

So,

<S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait! Oh wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so the average z-component of the moment is mu_z = gamma <S_z>.

So,

< mu_z > = gamma * < S_z > = gamma * (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, the question says the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating. So the oscillation frequency is the coefficient of t inside the cosine.

Wait, the argument is gamma B t, so the coefficient is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B. But wait, the options are given, let me see.

Wait, wait, the expression is (gamma B) t, so the angular frequency is omega = gamma B.

But the frequency in terms of cycles per second (Hz) is omega/(2pi). But the question asks about the oscillation frequency, which is the coefficient inside the cosine function, so the angular frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the options are:

Options:
A) gamma*B/2
B) gamma*B
C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B
D) gamma*B/sqrt(2)

So, the oscillation frequency is gamma B, so the answer would be option B.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes factors can be tricky.

Wait, earlier I derived that <S_z> = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t )

Then, <mu_z> = gamma * <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

But wait, that can't be right because mu is given as gamma S, and S is in units of ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify the units. The spin component S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So, the magnetic moment mu is given as gamma S_z, so mu_z = gamma (± ħ/2 )

But when we compute <mu_z>, the expectation value is gamma <S_z>, which is gamma multiplied by <S_z>.

In our case, <S_z> is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ), so <mu_z> = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t )

But wait, the oscillation is in <mu_z>, right? So the time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), which has an angular frequency of gamma B.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the energy eigenstates calculation.

Wait, earlier, I considered the state |psi(t)> and found that the expectation value of S_z is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t ). So <mu_z> is gamma times that.

Wait, but the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so yes, mu_z = gamma S_z.

So, <mu_z> = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Thus, the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

Wait, but let's think about the time dependence of <mu_z>. It's proportional to cos(gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B. Therefore, the frequency is gamma B.

Looking back at the options, option B is gamma*B, so that would be the correct answer.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. The field is then switched to point along the $+y$ direction, and the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$, is to be determined.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, specifically $|+z\rangle$, since the magnetic field is initially along $+z$.

2. **Field Switch**: When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to the $+y$ direction, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian:
   \[
   H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y.
   \]
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**: After the field switch, the time evolution of the state is governed by the Hamiltonian. The eigenstates $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ acquire time-dependent phase factors:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{e^{i\gamma B t / 2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t / 2} |-y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
   \]

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: The expectation value of $S_z$ in the state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is computed as:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Magnetic Moment**: Since $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the expectation value of $\mu_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

6. **Oscillation Frequency**: The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is governed by the cosine term, which has an angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. This is the oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the magnetic moment.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The angular frequency of the oscillation is $\gamma B$.
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the $z$-component of the particle’s moment is $\gamma B$.

**Answer: B**
