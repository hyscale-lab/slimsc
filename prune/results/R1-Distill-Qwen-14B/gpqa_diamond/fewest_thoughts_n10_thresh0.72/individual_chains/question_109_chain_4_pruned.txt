Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me think about what I know.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Wait, the final state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to find out which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are different transitions, each with a lowercase letter denoting the angular momentum state of X. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to something else plus a particle.

First, I remember that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0, S is 0, L is 0 (since S is the spin, which is 0 for singlet, and L is the orbital angular momentum, which for S is zero). So the initial state is spin 0, orbital 0, total angular momentum J=0.

When they emit a particle X, the system goes to a new state. The parity of the initial state is important because parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The initial state's parity is given by (-1)^L, so for L=0, parity is +1.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So when X is emitted, it affects the overall parity conservation. Because parity is conserved in strong interactions, but perhaps not here? Wait, but the question says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So I should probably check parity conservation.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about parity conservation in this context. Let me think. The initial parity is that of the NN system, which is +1 because L=0. When X is emitted, the parity of the system plus X should be conserved? Or perhaps, when X is emitted, the parity of the initial state times the parity of X should equal the parity of the final state of the NN system.

Wait, no. The parity of the entire system after emission must be considered. The initial parity is P_initial = P_NN_initial * P_X (since X is part of the system?), but maybe in this case, X is a decay product. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps parity is conserved as P_final = P_initial * P_X.

Wait, no. Let me think about it. The initial system has parity P_initial. After emission, the system becomes the NN in a state with parity P_final, and the emitted particle X has parity P_X. The total parity is P_initial = P_final * P_X. Because parity is multiplicative, right? So P_initial = P_final * P_X. Because the process must conserve overall parity. So P_final = P_initial / P_X. Since P_initial is +1, and P_X is -1, then P_final = (+1)/(-1) = -1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the initial state is 1S0, which has parity +1
