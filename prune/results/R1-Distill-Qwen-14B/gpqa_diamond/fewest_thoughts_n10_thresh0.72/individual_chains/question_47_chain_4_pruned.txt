Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's see what the options are and how to approach this.

First, let's look at the given data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those regions usually correspond to N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or an ester. But since the molecule has an N, maybe it's an amide or something else.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Each option has different functional groups. Let's think about their possible NMR and IR.

The IR has N-H stretches, so the compound likely has either an amine or amide. Let's consider each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. That would have an amide group (CONH2?), but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Benzamide would be C7H7NO2, and ethoxy is C2H5O, so adding that would make C9H11NO2. So that fits. The IR would show amide N-H stretches around 3300-3500, which matches the given IR. The carbonyl would be around 1680-1700 cm^-1, which is close to the 1720 given. Wait, but amides have lower carbonyl frequencies. Hmm.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR. The IR would have N-H from formamide around 3400 cm^-1 and the carbonyl around 1700. The molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. So that fits as well.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, and 4-aminophenyl would be aniline. The formula would be C8H11NO3, but wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match. Wait, let me calculate: phenyl is C6H5, amino is NH2, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is NH2-C6H4-CH2CH2COOH. Wait, that would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option C is out because it has three oxygen atoms. So C is not correct.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Benzoate is COOEt (ethyl ester), and 4-aminophenyl. The formula would be C9H11NO3. Wait, because 4-aminobenzoate would be O=C-OEt, so COOEt is O2, and the amine is NH2. The formula would be C8H7NO3 plus ethyl (C2H5), making C10H12NO3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me calculate:

Benzoate is C7H5O2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2, ester would replace the -OH with OEt, so O2. 4-aminobenzoate would be C7H6O2 plus NH2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The structure is O=C-O-C2H5 attached to the benzene ring which has an NH2 group in the para position.

So the molecular formula: benzene ring (C6H5), with a COOEt group (C2H5O2) and an NH2.

So total carbons: 6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) = 9? Wait, COOEt is O2 and has 3 carbons (COO-C2H5). So the molecule is C6H5-COO-C2H5 with a NH2 group on the benzene. So the formula would be C6 + 3 (COOEt) + 2 (ethyl) ? No, wait, the COOEt is O2, but it's part of the benzoate. So the formula is C9H11NO3. Because:

Benzoate ester: C6H5COOEt. C6 + 2 (COO) + 2 (ethyl) = 6+2+2=10? Wait, no. The benzoate is C7H5O2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2, ester would be C7H5O2 when you replace -OH with OEt). Then adding an NH2 (which is in the benzene ring now, so the benzene is C6H4 (since two substituents: COOEt and NH2). So the molecular formula would be C6H4(COOEt)(NH2). Let's count:

COOEt is 3 carbons (COO- and ethyl). So C6 (benzene) + 3 (COOEt) = 9 C. N is 1. O is 2 (from COO) plus 1 (from NH2) ??? Wait, no. COOEt is O2. The NH2 is N and O? No, the NH2 is just N. So O2 from COOEt and O from... wait, the amine is NH2. So the O count is 2. So molecular formula is C9H11NO3? Because:

COOEt is O2, and the amine adds another O? No, the amine is NH2, no O. So O count is 2 (from COOEt). Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me calculate:

Each substituent on benzene is:

COOEt: which is O2, and C3.

NH2: which is N1, no O.

So benzene is C6H5 (but with substituents, so C6H4). Then COOEt is C3H5O2. So overall:

C6 + C3 = C9.

H: H4 (from benzene) + H5 (from COOEt) + H2 (from NH2) = H4+5+2=11.

N: 1.

O: 2.

So molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Oh wait, that matches the given formula! So option D would have molecular formula C9H11NO2. So D is a possible candidate.

Wait, but earlier I thought option D's formula is C9H11NO3, but now it seems it's C9H11NO2. So maybe I was wrong earlier. So option D is possible.

Now, going back to the options, only option C is eliminated because of the wrong formula. So the possible options are A, B, D.

Now, let's look at the 1H NMR data.

The NMR data is:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → This is likely a CH2CH3 group, triplet, which is an ethyl group attached to something deshielded maybe, but more likely an ethyl ester or ethyl ether. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, so maybe an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like O or N.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → Broad singlet, probably NH2 protons. But wait, in the IR the N-H stretches are present, which suggests NH groups. However, if the NH is exchanged, it might show as a broad peak. But 4.0 ppm is more downfield for NH2? Or maybe not. Alternatively, this could be an OCH2 group, but if it's a singlet and broad, perhaps
