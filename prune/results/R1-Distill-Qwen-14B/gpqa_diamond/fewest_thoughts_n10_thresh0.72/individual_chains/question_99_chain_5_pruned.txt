Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a carboxylic acid group (since they end with COOH). Let me break down the information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches, but since the options all have a COOH group, which has an O-H stretch, that makes sense. The very broad peak might suggest a strong hydrogen bond, like in a carboxylic acid.

Another strong peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹. That's a typical region for a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids usually have their carbonyl around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that fits.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that several peaks were observed, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens, meaning no alkenes. So all structures must not have any vinyl groups, which they don't because looking at the options, all seem to be substituents around a central carbon, maybe a cyclopropane or something else? Wait, no, each option has a chain leading to a COOH.

Wait, actually, looking at the options, they all have a chain structure. For example, option D is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So this would be something like a central carbon possibly connected to a CH2CH3, and perhaps other substituents.

In the NMR, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated splitting. Let me think about what that implies.

In proton NMR, splitting arises from neighboring protons. So a doublet of triplets of quartets would mean that a proton is next to three different sets of neighboring protons. Or perhaps a more complex splitting due to multiple adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the COOH group are more substituted, leading to more neighboring hydrogens.

Looking at the options, all of them have a CH2 or CH group next to the COOH. Let me consider each option.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So structure is something like CH2COOH connected to a central carbon which is attached to two C2H5 groups and a CH3. Wait, the central carbon (let's say position 2) would be connected to a CH3, two C2H5, and a CH2COOH. So symmetry might play a role here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is like (CH3)(C2H5)2C-CH2COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2
