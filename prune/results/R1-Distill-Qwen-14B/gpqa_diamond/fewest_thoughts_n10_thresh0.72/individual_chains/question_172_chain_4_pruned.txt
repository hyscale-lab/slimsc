Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which probably means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of energy states in a system in equilibrium. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ), where g is the degeneracy, E is energy, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference Î”E is E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. But the question is about the excitation, meaning the ratio of excited to ground state atoms.

Wait, but the question says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, the population ratio is n_1 / n_2 = 2. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me clarify. If in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited, meaning the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. So n_1 (excited state) / n_2 (excited state) = 2?

Wait, no, wait, the way the question is phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level is higher for star_1. So, the population in the specific higher energy level is higher for star_1.

So perhaps (n_high / n_low)_1 = 2 * (n_high / n_low)_2. Or maybe the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, (n_high / n_low)_1 = 2 * (n_high / n_low)_2.

But wait, the question says the excitation is twice
