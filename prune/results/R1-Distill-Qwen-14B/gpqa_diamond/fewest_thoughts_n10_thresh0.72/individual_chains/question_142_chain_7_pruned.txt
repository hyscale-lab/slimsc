Okay, so I've got this question about the density matrix of a qubit. Hmm, the question is asking about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are given as points in 3D space, which I think relates to the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, I remember that a qubit state can be represented on the Bloch sphere, which is a 2-sphere embedded in 3D space. The density matrix, on the other hand, is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state).

The given density matrix is rho equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me write that out. So rho = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). That looks familiar. I think this is a classical mixture of the |0> and |1> states.

Wait, what's the density matrix for a pure state? Oh right, a pure state |psi> would have rho equal to |psi><psi|, and Tr(rho^2) would equal 1. But for a mixed state, Tr(rho^2) is less than 1. Let me compute Tr(rho^2) here.

So rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So rho squared would be [ (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2 ]^2. Let's compute each term. Squaring each gives (|0><0|)^2 = |0><0|0><0| = |0><0|, same for |1><1|. The cross terms are |0><0||1><1| and |1><1||0><0|, which are zero when multiplied because <0|1> is zero.

So rho squared is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/4. Taking the trace of rho squared would be Tr(rho^2) = (1/4)(Tr(|0><0|) + Tr(|1><1|) ) = (1/4)(1 + 1) ) = 1/2. Since Tr(rho^2) is 1/2 < 1, it's a mixed state.

Now, what's the geometrical position of this state on the Bloch sphere? I remember that for a density matrix, the corresponding point on the Bloch sphere can be found using the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let me express rho in terms of I and the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix is I = |0><0| + |1><1|. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So that's exactly (I)/2. Therefore, the equation becomes rho = (I + 0·σ)/2. Which implies that the vector r is zero. So the point is at the origin?

Wait, but let me think again. The Bloch sphere represents pure states. But this is a mixed state, actually a completely mixed state. The completely mixed state has no direction, so it should be at the center of the Bloch sphere,
