Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with excitation of atoms in stars, the Boltzmann distribution is probably involved. LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so that means the conditions in the photosphere are such that we can apply the Boltzmann equation.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I think this is the energy difference ΔE between two adjacent levels, maybe like E_upper minus E_lower.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. But since the question is about the excitation being twice as much, I guess the ratio is n1/n2 = 2. Wait, no: star_1 has twice the excitation, so for star_1, the ratio would be higher than for star_2.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So for star_1, the number in the excited state (n1) is twice that of star_2's (n2) in the same state? Or perhaps it's the ratio between the two stars for the same level. Let me read the question again. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state population for the same level. So for that level, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

Wait, no, probably it's that the excitation is higher for star_1. So, the ratio of excited to ground state (or lower state) might be higher in star_1. Let's assume that the ground state is the lower level, and the excited is the upper. So n_upper / n_lower is the excitation ratio.

So for star_1, n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n
