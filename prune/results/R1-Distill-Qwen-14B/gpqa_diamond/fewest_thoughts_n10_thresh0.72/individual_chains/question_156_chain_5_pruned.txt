Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks appear in each case.

Hmm. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent in epoxidation. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. But wait, the reaction conditions also include aqueous acid after that. Oh right, acid workup probably leads to ring-opening of the epoxide.

Wait, but how does the stereochemistry affect the product? Let me think. So, for each starting alkene, E and Z, when they react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. Since mCPBA is a peracid, it's used for epoxidation via the Prilezhaev oxidation. The reaction is stereospecific, I think. So, for each diastereomer, the epoxide would form differently.

But wait, wait, wait. The starting alkenes are E and Z isomers of oct-4-ene. So, (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on opposite sides, and (Z) has them on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with each, it forms an epoxide. The structure would depend on the starting geometry. So, for (E), when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen atoms add across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the original alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no, wait a second. mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition. So when the double bond is E, the substituents on each carbon are opposite. Adding the oxygen atoms on the same face would lead to what kind of epoxide? Let me try drawing it.

Let's imagine the (E)-oct-4-ene. Structure is CH2CH2 on each end, but the substituents are opposite. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds from the same face. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, adding the epoxide would form an epoxide where the
