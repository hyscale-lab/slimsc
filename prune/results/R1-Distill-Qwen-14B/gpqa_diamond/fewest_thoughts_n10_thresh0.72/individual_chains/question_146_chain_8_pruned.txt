Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about reacting 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene with maleic anhydride. I'm supposed to find the major product among the four options given. Hmm, right, I remember that when dienes react with dienophiles, it's a Diels-Alder reaction. Oh wait, but wait, the diene here is cyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me think about its structure.

Cyclopenta-1,3-diene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, right? So positions 1 and 3 are double bonds. Wait, actually, wait—if it's 1,3-diene, that's conjugated, making a conjugated diene. But since it's a cyclopentane system, the ring is five-membered with two double bonds. So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with double bonds at 1,3 positions. But wait, wait—wait, no, 1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. So the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 3-4. So, like
