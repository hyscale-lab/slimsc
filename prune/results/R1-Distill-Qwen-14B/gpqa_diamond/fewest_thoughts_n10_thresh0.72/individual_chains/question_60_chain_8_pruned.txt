Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through this. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work it out.

So the scenario is an alien astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective.

Wait, right, when you're moving at such a high speed, especially a significant fraction of light speed, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is that thing where time passes slower for the moving observer compared to a stationary one. So from the astronaut's point of view, less time would pass than from Earth's perspective.

But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. There are two effects here: time dilation and length contraction. Because if the astronaut is moving at such a high speed, the distance between the starting point and Earth would appear shorter in their frame of reference due to length contraction. So maybe I should calculate the distance from their perspective and then determine the time based on their speed.

Wait, what's the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth? Oh
