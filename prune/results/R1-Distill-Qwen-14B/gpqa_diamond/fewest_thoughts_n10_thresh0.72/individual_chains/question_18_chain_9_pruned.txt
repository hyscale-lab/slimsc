Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are given as 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the problem might not require the masses directly unless it's related to something like luminosity or lifespan. But the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses are just extra info.

The abundances are given using the EW method under LTE. Oh right, LTE is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, and EW is Equivalent Width, which is a method to determine the abundance of elements by measuring the strength of spectral lines.

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, that would be [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or the ratio of their silicon abundances.

Wait, wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms. So, perhaps it's [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2. Because the ratio would be how much Si each star has relative to hydrogen.

So, first thing to do is find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2, then take their ratio.

Let me jot down the steps:

For Star_1:
We know [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So, [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_Sun = 0. So, nFe/nH for Star_1 is the same as the Sun's. Because:

[Fe/H] = log ( (nFe/nH)_star / (nFe/nH)_sun )

If [Fe/H] is 0, then (nFe/nH)_star = (nFe/nH)_sun.

So, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → (nFe/nH)_1 = Sun's Fe/H.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → (nMg/nH)_2 = (nMg/nH)_sun.

But we need [Si/H] for each star. So let's think about how to get that.

We have [Si/Fe]_1. That's [Si/Fe]_1 = log( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun )

Hmm, because [X/Y] = log( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun )

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun ) = 0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = (nSi/nFe)_sun * 10^0.3.

Wait, but we can maybe express nSi in terms of nFe and nH.

Wait, let's think about Star_1.

We know [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe/nH)_1 = (nFe/nH)_sun.

Let me denote the Sun's nFe/nH as FeH_sun = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, nMg/nH_sun = 10^(-5).

So,
