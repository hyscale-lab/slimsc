Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and chromatography concepts. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

So the question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each starting with a different compound. After each reaction is completed, their products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

First, I'll tackle each reaction separately to figure out what products are formed.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce ketones, esters, amides, etc. In this case, the compound is a ketone (since the -one suffix indicates a ketone). So LAH would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol.

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:
CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one has the ketone group on carbon 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But in this case, it's 5-methoxy, so the methoxy is on carbon 5. Let's number from the ketone.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(O)-(CH2)2-CH3. So the carbons are 1 2 3 4 5 6.

Carbon 3 is the carbonyl. So the structure is:
CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Maybe it's:

Actually, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. So more accurately, it's:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but considering the 5-methoxy, that's on carbon 5. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2
