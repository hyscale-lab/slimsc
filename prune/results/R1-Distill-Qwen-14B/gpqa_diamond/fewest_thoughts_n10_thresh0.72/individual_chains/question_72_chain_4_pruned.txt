Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a series of reactions starting with a certain compound and going through several steps. The final product's structure is needed to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms.

First, let's look at the starting material: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I'm a bit rusty on bicyclic compounds, but I remember that the notation bicyclo[m.n.p] refers to the number of carbons in each bridge. So bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta means a norbornane structure, right? Norbornene, more specifically because there are double bonds mentioned (hepta-2,5-diene). So it's a norbornene system with a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, I think this might be a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting compound is a diene (norbornene), and the other compound is a dienophile? Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So that's a cyclohexadiene with two substituents: each is a dibromomethyl group on carbons 5 and 6.

Wait, but wait. Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene and a dienophile. The norbornene is a diene, so maybe the other compound is acting as a dienophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder where the dienophile is the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, no. Let me think. 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has a conjugated diene system: positions 1 and 3. So 1 and 2 are double bonds, and 3 and 4? Or maybe it's 1,3-diene, so the double bonds are between 1-2 and 3-4? So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated di
