Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain parameters. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, when looking at the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2, they observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, and the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g are the statistical weights, E are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The spots affect the overall Teff, so I guess the temperature in the photosphere is lower when spots are present. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, right? So when the star has spots covering part of its surface, the overall effective temperature of the entire photosphere might change, but the question says that the overall Teff decreases to 5500 K. So perhaps the effective temperature is an average of the spotted and unspotted areas.

Wait, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the star's average temperature is lower when spots are present. But the spots are cooler, so maybe the rest of the surface is at a higher temperature?

Wait, no. Wait, the star's surface without spots is at 6000 K. When
