Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z, which is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Hmm, let's break this down. The partition function for a system is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for each possible state. Since each spin can be +1 or -1, the total number of possible states for three spins is 2^3 = 8. So I'll need to calculate the energy for each of these 8 states and then sum up their Boltzmann factors.

Wait, but calculating each of the 8 states might be a bit tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the possible values of the energy term.

The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of the spins. So let's look at each possible configuration.

Each spin S_i can be ±1. So S1S2 can be +1 or -1, same for S1S3 and S2S3. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary depending on the state.

Let me list all possible combinations.

Wait, maybe I can categorize the states based on the number of +1 and -1 in the products. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of aligned (ferromagnetic) and anti-aligned (antiferromagnetic) pairs.

Wait, another approach: the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can take different values. Let me compute the possible values.

Each of the terms S_i S_j can be +1 if the spins are aligned, and -1 if anti-aligned. So the sum can be 3 (all three aligned), 1 (two aligned, one anti-aligned), -1 (two anti-aligned, one aligned), or -3 (all three anti-aligned).

Wait, let's check that. Let's take all three aligned. For example, S1=S2=S3= +1. Then each product is +1, so sum is 3. Similarly, all
