Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of the options a to f would meet the S/N ratio requirement. Let me start by recalling what I know about ESPRESSO and S/N.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. I remember it's designed for things like exoplanet studies and measuring stellar velocities. The key here is the signal-to-noise ratio. The question states that a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

Wait, the S/N depends on several factors. I think it's related to the brightness of the star, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. Oh right, the formula for S/N is something like sqrt(N), where N is the number of photons collected. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact formula, so maybe I should look for some relations or maybe think about how absolute magnitude affects this.

The stars in the options have varying distances and absolute magnitudes. Wait, absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude a star would have at 10 parsecs. So the apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs.

For each option, I'll need to calculate the apparent magnitude and then determine if the S/N is sufficient. But wait, how does apparent magnitude relate to S/N? I think the S/N increases with the brightness of the star (lower apparent magnitude is brighter). So for a given exposure time and instrument, brighter stars (lower m) will have higher S/N.

I remember that the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time. Since the exposure is 1 hour, but I'm not sure how ESPRESSO's efficiency plays into this. Maybe I should find a way to relate apparent magnitude to S/N.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept that each step in magnitude is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness. So each magnitude step (like from 5 to 6) is about a 2.5x change in brightness. But how does that translate to S/N? Because S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux. So going from m1 to m2, the flux ratio is 2.512^(m1 - m2). Then the S/N ratio would be sqrt(flux ratio).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. S/N is proportional to the square root of the number of detected photons. So if star A is brighter than star B by a factor of F, then the S/N for A is sqrt(F) times that of B. So if a star is 5 magnitudes brighter (say, m=5 vs m=10), that's a factor of 100 in brightness (since each magnitude is ~2.512, so 2.512^5 â‰ˆ 100). So the S/N would be sqrt(100) = 10 times higher. Oh wait, that
