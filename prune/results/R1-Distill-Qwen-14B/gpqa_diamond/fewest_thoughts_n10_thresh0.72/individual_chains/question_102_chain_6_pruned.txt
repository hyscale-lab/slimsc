Okay, I'm trying to tackle this pretty complex question about gene expression constructs and why a particular fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Let me go through this step by step.

So, the setup is that there's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one construct, right? The ligand is at the 5' end, followed by the receptor at the 3'. Each has a fluorescent marker: ligand is fused to mCherry, and receptor to eGFP. 

Looking at the regulatory elements: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA stands for chicken beta-actin, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under an IRES element, which I remember allows internal ribosome entry, so it can be expressed in a different tissue or condition than the upstream promoter. 

Stop cassettes are between the ligand and mCherry (loxP-stop-loxP) and between receptor and eGFP (lox2272-stop-lox2272). So unless the stop is excised, the fluorescent proteins won't be expressed. The Cre-lox system is used here, I suppose, to regulate the expression of these genes.

The experiment is done in primary astrocyte culture, and after transfection, they check Western blot using antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. But when they breed mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, and then cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see a green signal. Green is eGFP, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they saw a signal proportional to actin, so the transfection and protein loading are working. So the problem isn't in the blot setup. It's about the expression in the mice.

SOX10-Cre is a transactivator; it's often used to drive Cre expression in specific tissues. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, I think. So the Cre would be active in neural crest cells or their derivatives, like astrocytes.

In the mice, the construct is homozygous, so each allele should have the same setup. But when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is hemizygous, the Cre would be active in the same cells as SOX10 is expressed.

Back to the vector design: the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES, which is usually weaker. So ligand might be expressed more than the receptor.

The stop cassettes are flanked by loxP sites for the ligand's side and lox2272 for the receptor's. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. Oh wait, no, wait. I remember that loxP is a site recognized by Cre, which causes recombination. Lox2272 is a variant of loxP, but in the presence of Cre, it can mediate recombination as well, but perhaps in a different way. Or maybe the lox sites determine the direction of the excision.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. So the first gene (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, then the stop cassette (loxP-stop), then the receptor, which is followed by another stop cassette (lox2272-stop). So the ligand is before the stop, and the receptor after.

Wait, no, the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but there's a stop in loxP-stop between them. So the transcription would start with CBA promoter, drive the ligand, then stop. Unless the loxP is excised by Cre, allowing the ORF to continue.

Similarly, for the receptor, it's at the 3' end, with an IRES upstream. Then a stop cassette with lox2272. So
