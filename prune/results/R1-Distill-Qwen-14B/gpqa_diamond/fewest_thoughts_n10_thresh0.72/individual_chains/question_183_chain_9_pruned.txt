Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one degree. 

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize that structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering is such that there's a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) at position 5. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the group is attached as CH2CH2? No, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- so maybe it's -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond. Wait, no, the group is a vinyl group, which is =CH2, but attached where? Let me think. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3. So, the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, perhaps. Then, position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (which is CH2=CH- attached to C5).

So the molecule would look like a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5. The cyclohexene itself has one double bond, contributing one degree of unsaturation. Then, the formyl group is a CHO, which is an aldehyde. That doesn't add any rings or double bonds because it's a carbonyl, which is a double bond, right? So that's another degree.

Wait, but the index is calculated based on the formula. The formula for the starting material: let's think about it. The main ring is cyclohexene, which is C6H10O, but wait, the substituents add more carbons. The formyl group is CHO, which is one carbon, so that's +1 carbon and +1 O. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which is two carbons. So the substituents add 3
