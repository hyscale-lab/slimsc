Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let me try to parse what the question is asking.

So, the setup is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the surface covered by these spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, I assume, since they're dark. The temperature difference is 1000 K, so the spots must be at 5000 K.

The question is about photometric brightness variations. When a star is observed, and it's not spots but an exoplanet that's causing the change, we can see a dip in brightness when the planet transits in front of the star. But in this case, the spots cause variations as the star rotates, so from our point of view, the spots come into and out of view, modulating the brightness.

The problem states that the observed signal (the dip in brightness) is similar to that of an exoplanet. So, we need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots do.

Wait, the key point is that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would cause the same dip. So the spot-induced dip is being compared to an exoplanet's transit-induced dip.

I think I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness for both scenarios and set them equal. Then solve for the planet's radius relative to the star.

First, let's think about the star with spots. When the spots rotate into view, the brightness decreases because the spots are darker. The brightness variation would depend on the area of the spots. But wait, the star is being viewed from a certain angle. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, as it rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. The maximum effect would be when the spot area is fully visible.

Wait, the star has a radius R equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered, so the area of the spots is 0.5 * R^2 (since hemisphere is half the surface area). But the filling factor is 20%, which is 0.2. So the actual area covered by spots is 0.2 * 0.5 R² = 0.1 R²? Or wait, wait. Let me think again.

No, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So if the hemisphere's area is 0.5 R² (since the whole star's surface is 4πR², but a hemisphere is 2π R²?), wait. Let me get the surface area correctly.

The total surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So a hemisphere would have 2πR² area. The filling factor is 20%, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the filling factor refers to the entire star's surface. Because if the entire star
