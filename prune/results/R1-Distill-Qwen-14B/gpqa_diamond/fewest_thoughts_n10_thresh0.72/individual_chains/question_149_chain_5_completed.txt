Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound shows peaks that are a bit off. Specifically, there are two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is normal because you'd expect a single proton. They ruled out spin-spin coupling, so it's not a splitting issue. Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. Hmm.

So, what could cause these observations?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contamination with a precursor. If that were the case, the NMR would probably show more than just the two alpha-proton peaks. Plus, the mass spec would have a different mass for the precursor. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as the expected, so A might not be right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have the same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. In NMR, if you have a racemic mixture, you might see some different splitting because the enantiomers can cause different coupling. Wait, but the peaks are for the same alpha proton. Oh, wait, I remember that in a racemic mixture (both enantiomers present in equal amounts), the NMR spectrum can sometimes look like it has more peaks because the splitting isn't resolved. But wait, in 1D NMR, enantiomers would actually produce the same peaks. Because the environment is the same for each equivalent proton, so whether it's R or S, the chemical shift would be the same. So maybe B isn't the issue here.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Double coupling, like in a diastereotopic situation? Wait, I'm not too clear on that. If during the formation of an amide bond, perhaps some kind of coupling led to two different products. Alternatively, maybe an amide bond formed in two different ways, causing some doublet splitting. But the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so perhaps this isn't about coupling but about some other issue.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereoisomers have different physical properties. So in the NMR, each would have different shifts but for the same proton. Wait, but the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So if it's diastereomers, the alpha protons would have different environments, so their shifts might not be that similar. But if the two diastereomers are very similar in structure, perhaps the shifts are similar. But why would the integral add up to 1H? Because each diastereomer has one alpha proton, and they're present in equal amounts.

Wait, but if the sample is a racemic mixture (enantiomers), the NMR would just see one set of peaks because the environment is the same for each proton. But if it's diastereomers, each has a different environment. So perhaps the two peaks in NMR correspond to the same proton in each diastereomer. So for each molecule, that proton is in a slightly different environment, leading to two peaks. And since the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, the integrals add up to 1H.

But wait, the question states that the 1H NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. So maybe the molecule has some symmetry or something else causing the same proton to split into two. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of diastereotopic protons, which are nonequivalent but in the same environment. But diastereotopic protons typically have different shifts. Hmm.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. So that suggests that the molecular weight is the same. So they must be either enantiomers or diastereomers. Because a different mass would mean different compounds.

So if it's a diastereomer mixture, then the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton in different environments. Their chemical shifts are similar, not too far apart. The integrals would add to 1H because each diastereomer has one of those protons, and they're in equal amounts.

Alternatively, if it's a mix of enantiomers, the NMR would still show one peak because the protons are in the same environment (since enantiomers are mirror images). So the NMR wouldn't split into two peaks for the same proton. So that suggests option D is more likely.

But wait, the problem says the 1H NMR is consistent except for two peaks for the same alpha proton. So why would that happen? Let me think about possible structures. If the compound has a stereocenter, and the alpha proton is on a chiral center, then perhaps the presence of diastereomers would cause that. But wait, in that case, the same alpha proton would have different environments in each diastereomer. So if you have a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each contributing a peak for the same proton in a different environment, you'd get two peaks.

But wait, another angle: during synthesis, perhaps an amide bond formation led to some side products. For instance, if the amide formation didn't go to completion, you might have some starting material left. But in that case, the mass spec would show a different mass for the starting material. So that would be option A, but the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So option A is unlikely.

So back to diastereomers. If the compound has a stereocenter elsewhere, leading to diastereomers, each with the same overall molecular weight. For example, if the molecule has two stereocenters, and the synthesis didn't go to a single diastereomer. So in that case, the NMR would see two signals for the alpha proton, each with similar shifts if the structures are similar. The integrals would add up to 1H since each diastereomer has one of these protons.

Wait, but in the case of diastereomers, each diastereomer would have a set of protons. So perhaps the alpha proton in one diastereomer is in a different environment than the other. So each contributes a peak. So if the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, the integrals would add to 1H for each group.

So the NMR would show two peaks for the same proton in each diastereomer. Then, the LC-MS would show two peaks, same mass. So that fits.

So the options are between B and D. Because B is enantiomers, which would not split the NMR peak for the same proton. D is diastereomers, which would split the NMR into two peaks for the same proton in each.

So the correct answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but another thought: could it be a case of tautomers? But tautomers usually have different structures, like in amides or imides, but I don't think that would produce the same mass.

Alternatively, could it be a result of an isomerization during the synthesis? Like, the compound forms more than one regioisomer or something. But that would probably lead to a different mass if it's a different connectivity, which the question says the mass is consistent.

So I think the best fit is D.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   If the compound were contaminated with a precursor, the NMR would likely show additional peaks corresponding to the precursor's protons, and the mass spectrum would reveal a different mass for the precursor. However, the question specifies that both peaks in the LC-MS have the same mass as the expected molecule, ruling out this option.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are mirror images and have the same physical properties, including identical chemical shifts in NMR. Therefore, a racemic mixture of enantiomers would not produce two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton in the NMR spectrum. This explanation is inconsistent with the observed data.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as an explanation for the duplicate peaks. Additionally, "double coupling" during amide bond formation would likely result in more complex splitting patterns, not two distinct peaks with similar chemical shifts. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties due to differences in their spatial arrangements. If the compound is a mixture of two diastereoisomers, the same alpha-proton would experience different chemical environments in each diastereomer, leading to two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum with similar but slightly different chemical shifts. The integrals of these peaks would add up to 1H if the diastereomers are present in equal amounts. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, further supports this explanation, as diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This accounts for the two distinct NMR peaks, their similar chemical shifts, and the equal integrals, as well as the LC-MS data showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass.
