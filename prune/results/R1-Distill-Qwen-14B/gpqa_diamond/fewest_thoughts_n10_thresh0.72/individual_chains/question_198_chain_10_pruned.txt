Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says we have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... Hmm, I think that refers to the Co(SCN)_2 complex, which is blue. But wait, isn't Co(SCN)_2 actually pink? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh well, the question specifies the blue one, so I'll assume it's Co(SCN)₂²+.

Stability constants, right. So the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. For each step, adding another SCN- ion. So for each complex, the βn is the constant for the nth ion.

So the complexes would be:

Co²+ + n SCN⁻ ⇌ Co(SCN)_n²−n

Wait, no, charge-wise, Co²+ has +2 charge. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So for n SCN⁻, the charge would be 2 - n.

Wait, let's think: each SCN⁻ is -1. So Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN. The charge would be 2+ + (-1) = 1+ for the first complex, right? Or wait, no, Co(SCN) would be Co²+ surrounded by one SCN⁻? Or maybe they form a complex where the charge is different. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the overall charge.

But perhaps I should just focus on the stability constants given. The beta values are for each successive addition. So β1 is for the first SCN⁻, β2 for the second, etc.

So the complexes are:

Co²+ → [Co] → β1 = 9

Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [CoSCN] → β1 =9

Then [CoSCN] + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)₂] → β2=40? Wait, no, because each β is the cumulative constant up to that step. Wait, no, stability constants are typically for each step, but sometimes they are given as cumulative. Wait, the question says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So I think βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN⁻ ions. So:

β1 = [CoSCN]/( [Co²+][SCN⁻] )

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]/( [Co²+][SCN⁻]^2 )

β3 = [Co(SCN)3]/( [Co²+][SCN⁻]^3 )

β4 = [Co(SCN)4]/( [Co²+][SCN⁻]^4 )

Wait, but the
