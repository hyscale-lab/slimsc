Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about a peptidic compound's analysis. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So the scenario is that I have this small peptidic compound synthesized chemically, and I'm looking at its NMR and LC-MS data. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly like what we expect, except for two peaks that are from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Wait, but why are there two peaks? They ruled out spin-spin coupling because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So it's not like a doublet of doublets or something like that.

Then, looking at the LC-MS, when they run it at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So the mass part is the same, but the retention times are different. But why would there be two peaks with the same mass?

Hmm, possible explanations. Let's look at the options. 

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it were a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have a lower massâ€”like the starting material before a reaction. But the mass here matches the expected, so probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in the NMR, you might see some splitting because of diastereotopic protons, but wait, usually in NMR, if the sample has enantiomers, it's a racemic mixture. But racemic mixtures don't usually split the peaks into two because the environment for each proton is the same in each enantiomer. Unless the proton is chiral and in a different environment. Wait, but in this case, the two peaks have similar chemical shifts and integrate to 1H. If it's enantiomers, each would have the same number of protons, but I'm not sure how that would cause two peaks. Also, in the NMR, an enantiomer would have the same shifts, so maybe the same peak. But maybe if the compound has some sort of diastereotopic protons... Not sure yet.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means here. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, perhaps some side reaction or another coupling happened. But how would that affect the NMR? If two amide bonds formed, but the mass is the same, so maybe not. Or perhaps it's a different kind of coupling, but I'm not recalling specifically.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, so different NMR shifts, but wait. Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. If the diastereomers have the same environment for that alpha-proton, maybe they'd appear as a doublet? Or perhaps they're in different environments but similar. Hmm, but the two peaks here have similar chemical shifts, so maybe the diastereomers have adjacent protons that cause this. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mix of stereoisomers leading to two different environments for the alpha proton. Like if
