Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, paramagnetism involves magnetic fields and quantum numbers, right?

The problem states that the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and has a value of 1 Tesla. It also mentions small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, but maybe for s or other orbitals it's different. But since the problem says small m, perhaps m is zero or something close.

The question asks to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the energy shift due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, I remember that 0.486 micrometers is in the visible range, like the Balmer series for hydrogen. The Balmer-alpha line is about that wavelength. The transition energy ΔE would relate to the photon energy via E = hc/λ.

So first, I need to find expressions for both the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy. Then compare their magnitudes.

Starting with the transition energy ΔE. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The energy levels are E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8ε_0² h²) * 1/(n²), but I think it's more straightforward to use the formula where E is proportional to hc/λ. For the Balmer series, the transition is from n=2 to n=1, but wait, wait. Let me think. The Balmer-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2, right? Because the Balmer series starts at n=2 as the lower state. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Let me clarify. The Balmer series corresponds to transitions ending at n=2. So the α line is from n=3 to n=2, which gives λ = 656 nm (0.656 micrometers), but the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is about 486 nm. Oh, that's the Balmer-beta line, which is n=4 to n=2. Because the Rydberg formula for Balmer series is 1/λ = (1/4 - 1/n²), but wait, no. Let me get the exact formula.

Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R_H (1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)), where n2 > n1. For Balmer series, n1 is 2. So if the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers (486.1 nm), let's compute the Rydberg constant. R_H is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1.

So 1/λ = 1 / (486.1e-6 m) ≈ 2057.4 m^-1.

Set this equal to R_H (1/4 - 1/n2²). Let me solve for n2.

2057.4 = 1.097e7 * (1/4 - 1/n2²)
Divide both sides by 1.097e7: 2057.4 / 1.097e7 ≈ 0.000187.

So 0.000187 = 0.25 - 1/(n2²)
Rearranged: 1/(n2²) = 0.25 - 0.000187 ≈ 0.249813.

Take reciprocal: n2² ≈ 1/0.249813 ≈ 4.002. So n2 ≈ 2.0005, which is approximately 2. Wait, but that can't be because n2 has to be higher than 2. Oh, wait, maybe I did the calculation wrong. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 1/λ = 2057.4 m^-1. So 2057.4 = R_H (1/4 - 1/n2²).

R_H is 1.097e7, so 1.097e7 * (1/4 - 1/n2²) = 2057.4.

Divide both sides by 1.097e7: (1/4 - 1/n2²) ≈ 2057.4 / 1.097e7 ≈ 0.000187.

So 1/4 is 0.25, so 0.25 - 0.000187 ≈ 0.249813.

So 1/n2² = 0.249813.

n2² = 1/0.249813 ≈ 4.002 → n2 ≈ 2.0005.

Hmm, that's very close to 2. But n2 must be larger than n1=2 because the transition is from a higher state to n=2. Wait, so perhaps this is the n=3 to n=2 transition? Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps the wavelength given is for a different transition. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute the energy change ΔE using E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J.s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

So E = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (486.1e-6e-6) → wait, wait, λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm, so 486.1e-9 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (486.1e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) ≈ 4.088e-19 J.

Wait, but 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E ≈ 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, but for hydrogen atom energy levels, the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So transition from n=3 to n=2: E3= -1.51 eV, E2= -3.40 eV. So ΔE = E2 - E3 = (-3.40) - (-1.51) = -1.89 eV. The magnitude is about 1.89 eV. Hmm, so 2.55 eV is higher than that. Wait, but I must have made a mistake because the energy we calculated from E=hc/λ gives 2.55 eV. But the transition energy from n=3 to n=2 is about 1.89 eV. So perhaps the given wavelength corresponds to a different transition. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in E.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1e-9 m.

E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (486.1e-9 m) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) J.

Let me compute that division: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 → approximately 0.4089 * 1e-18 = 4.089e-19 J. Now, converting to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 4.089e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV.

But for the hydrogen atom, the transition from n=2 to n=1 has ΔE of about 10.2 eV (since E2 is -3.4 eV and E1 is -13.6 eV; ΔE = (-13.6) - (-3.4) = -10.2 eV → magnitude 10.2 eV). So the given wavelength is smaller than the wavelength for 10.2 eV. Because higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths. So, 2.55 eV is about a 0.486 μm photon, which would correspond to a lower transition, maybe n=4 to n=2? Because E4 = -0.85 eV, E2 is -3.4 eV. So ΔE would be 3.4 - 0.85 = 2.55 eV. Ah, that makes sense. So the transition is n=4 → n=2, which gives a ΔE of 2.55 eV. So that's the transition energy ΔE.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton μ_B multiplied by the quantum number m. The energy of this interaction is H = -μ·B = -μ_B m B.

Wait, but I think the energy term for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So the energy term would be H = -μ_B m B
