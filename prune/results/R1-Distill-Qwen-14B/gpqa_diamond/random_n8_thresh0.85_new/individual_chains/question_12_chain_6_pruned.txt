Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember from my studies that pions are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they split into other particles. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Pi plus has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? Because neutrinos are super light, almost massless.

Wait, so when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, conservation of momentum tells us that the momenta of the products must be equal and opposite. But since the neutrino is involved, which has a very small mass, maybe I can approximate its mass as zero. That should simplify things.

Let me think about the energy and momentum conservation here. The total energy before the decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi * c². Since c is the speed of light, but in particle physics units, we often just use MeV and c is considered as 1. So the initial energy E_initial = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon will have some kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, and the neutrino will just have energy since its rest mass is negligible. But since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite.

Let me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. The total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But also, the momentum of the muon, p_mu, and the neutrino, p_nu, are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the neutrino's mass is so small, its energy E_nu is approximately equal to its momentum times c. Wait, but because we're using units where c=1, E_nu is just p_nu * c, but in our case, c=1, so E_nu = p_nu.

Wait, no, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So for the neutrino, since m is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu. Similarly, for the muon, E_mu is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). But since p_mu is the same magnitude as p_nu (because their momenta are opposite), so p_mu = p_nu.

Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of p_mu. Let me denote p_mu as p. So, p_nu = p (but direction is opposite, but since energy is a scalar, I can just take the magnitudes here).

So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p)^2 c^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). But again, since in the units used, c=1, so E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

The neutrino's energy E_nu = p (since m_nu is negligible). 

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi. Because the initial energy is m_pi c², which is 139.6 MeV, and set equal to E_mu + E_nu.

So, the equation is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Wait, I need to solve for p first. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. But wait, that might get complicated. Let me set x = p for simplicity.

So, sqrt(x^2 + 105.7^2) + x = 139.6.

Let me rearrange this equation:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

So, x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

Subtract x^2 from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2. 

Calculating 139.6 squared: 139.6 *139.6. Let's approximate: 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less, so (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Wait, but wait, 105.7 squared is 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that: 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and the cross terms: 2*(100)(5.7)=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So, (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 = (19488.16) - (11172.49) = 8315.67 MeV².

So, 8315.67 = 2 * 139.6 * x.

Wait, the equation after subtracting x^2 was:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Wait, moving terms around:

2*139.6 x = (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2.

So, x = [ (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ] / (2*139.6 )

Which is x= 8315.67 / (2*139.6 )

2*139.6 is 279.2.

So, 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that.

Let me think, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 30 is a bit more than that. 279.2*29= 279.2*30=8376 minus 279.2 gives 8096.8. Wait, wait, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8? Hmm, 279.2 *30=8376, so subtract 279.2 → 8376 - 279.2= 8096.8. But 8315.67 is bigger than 8096.8.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

So, 279.2 × 29.8 = ?

Let me compute 279.2 × 30 = 8376.

But 8315.67 is less than 8376 by about 60.33.

So, 29.8 is 30-0.2.

So, 279.2 × 29.8 = 279.2 *30 - 279.2 *0.2 = 8376 - 55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, but 8315.67 is a bit less than 8320.16 by about 4.49.

So, let me compute 279.2 × 29.795.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use division.

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute this.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2*20=5584; 279.2*9=2512.8 → 5584+2512.8=8096.8. 

Subtract 8096.8 from 8315.67 → 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

Now, 279.2 * 0.779 ≈ 218.87 because 279.2 * 0.7 = 195.44; 279.2 *0
