Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6. So it's Li-6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion. I think I need to find the energy required to accelerate this ion to a speed where v=0.96c. Relativistic effects must be considered here because 0.96c is a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I can't just use classical mechanics; I have to use special relativity.

First, I'll recall the formula for relativistic energy. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So E = gamma * m0c².

But wait, what is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus? I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated using the mass number and the molar mass. Wait, but I think the more precise approach is to calculate it based on the number of protons and neutrons. Each proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c². But wait, wait. I think the actual rest mass of a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c², and a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c². But wait, maybe it's okay to approximate them as roughly 938 MeV each for this problem, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can look for the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to model the nucleus as having a rest mass of m = A * m_p, where m_p is the proton mass, but considering that neutrons have almost the same mass as protons. A is 6 in this case, so m =6 * m_p. But wait, wait. Wait, the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than A times the individual nucleon masses because of binding energy, but wait, in this context, since the problem is about relativistic energy, perhaps they just want me to approximate m as A*m_p.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. For the purpose of calculating the rest mass energy, I think the problem expects us to use the mass number A multiplied by the proton mass, but perhaps considering that the exact mass isn't given, I might need to use the mass of Li-6 in terms of u (atomic mass units). Let me think: The molar mass of Li-6 is about 6.941 g/mol, but wait, no, wait: no, the actual molar mass of Li-6 is 6.941 g/mol, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no—lithium has an atomic weight of about 6.941, so Li-6 is a major isotope, making up about 92.5%
