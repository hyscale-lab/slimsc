Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, okay, so there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. They only exist between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of a from the options given.

Wait, so the wave function is a complex function because of the -0.5i term. But when we talk about probabilities, we usually look at the square of the absolute value of the wave function, right? Because that gives the probability density.

So the wave function ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that out. So ψ(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i. To find the probability, I need to compute |ψ(x)|².

The absolute value squared of a complex number a + ib is (a)^2 + (b)^2. So in this case, the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but wait. When you have a complex number like A + iB, the absolute square is A² + B². So yeah, correct. So in this case, A is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and B is (-0.5). So A² is a²/(1+x), and B² is 0.25. So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

But wait, wait a second. Is that correct? Or is the wave function ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] * (1 - 0.5i)? Because sometimes the notation could be ambiguous. Oh, the way it's written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So it's a complex number where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but that's a bit odd because it's a function of x. So for each x, the wave function is a complex number where the real part depends on x and the imaginary part is a constant. Hmm, that's unusual. But okay, the problem says that, so we'll go with it.

The next part is that when measuring the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. That implies that the probability of finding the particle outside this range is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside of x=1 to x=3. But wait, our wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So how does that relate to the boundary conditions?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The wave function is given as that expression, but perhaps it's only valid in the region where the particle exists. So the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in the region between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Because when they measured, none were found outside 1 and 3.

But then, to normalize the wave function, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1. Because the total probability must be 1.

So the problem is to find a such that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

So let me write that out.

The integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i. So when you square the absolute value, you get (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2. So the integral of that is the sum of two integrals.

So ∫ [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 plus ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First part: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that's a² * ln(2).

Second part: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let me compute that.

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 is about 0.7213. Then a squared is approximately 0.7213, so a is the square root of that. Square root of 0.7213 is about 0.849. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.85 squared is 0.7225. Which is very close to 0.7213. So a is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, another way to write the wave function is ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5)i. So when we compute |ψ|^2, it's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.25). So that's correct.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931≈0.7213 → a≈0.849, which rounds to 0.85, so B is the correct answer.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability must integrate to 1 over this interval:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**:  
   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the total integral becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \implies a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \implies a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
