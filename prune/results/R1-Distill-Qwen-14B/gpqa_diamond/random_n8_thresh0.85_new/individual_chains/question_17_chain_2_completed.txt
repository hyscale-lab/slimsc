Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says it's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. They give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. And they're asking for the concentration of calcium ions. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The stoichiometric complex means that each EDTA molecule binds one Ca²+ ion, right? So the complex is CaY²- where Y is the EDTA.

The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So K_Ca-EDTA is the formation constant. 

In a solution where the complex is formed, the concentration of free calcium ions would be very low because most of them are tied up in the complex. So the problem is probably about finding the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

I think the formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/(( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )). But wait, in this case, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So the total concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M, assuming it's fully formed, but that's not exactly right because some might dissociate.

Wait, no. The problem states that it's a stochiometric solution. Hmm, stoichiometric usually means that the molar ratios are exact. So maybe the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA is such that they form the complex in a 1:1 ratio. But wait, when the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So for example, if the salt is CaEDTA·2H2O or something, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

But the key is that the complex can dissociate. So the solution will have [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M minus any that dissociates. But since K is very large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal, so the approximation is that [CaEDTA^2-] is approximately 0.02 M.

So the formation constant equation would be:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and assuming it's the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA, then when it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the total concentration of Ca²+ is [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA^2-], but since K is so large, [Ca²+] is much smaller than [CaEDTA^2-], so [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

But wait, perhaps the EDTA is in excess. Wait, no, the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution, meaning that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, maybe that's not correct because the Ca-EDTA is the only species present. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the solution is prepared such that the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA is such that they form the complex in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, another approach: the problem says it's a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, it's:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is given by K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-].

But for such a large K (5e10), the dissociation is very small. So [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] will be small compared to 0.02 M. Let me denote x as the concentration of Ca²+ produced from dissociation. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x (because of 1:1 ratio), and [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 since x is very small.

So substituting into K:

K = (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02 = 5e10.

Wait, no, because K is the formation constant, but the dissociation would be K_dissociation = 1/K_form. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the dissociation constant. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to set up the equation correctly.

Wait, formation constant is Kf = [Complex]/([M][L]), where M is metal ion, L is ligand. So for the reaction:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

But if Kf is 5e10, which is very large, that implies that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, so x is very small. So [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ 0.02, [Ca²+] ≈ x, [EDTA^4-] ≈ x.

So Kf = (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange that. Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02 - x) / (x * x).

But since x is so small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kf ≈ 0.02 / x².

We have Kf =5e10, so:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x²=4e-13? Wait, wait.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 0.02 / (5e10) = (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x=2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5?

Wait, no: 4e-13 = 4 * 1e-13 → sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.3e-7. Oh wait, 1e-6.5 is the same as 10^(-7 + 0.5) → 10^(-6.5) = 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.

So x ≈6.32e-7 M. So [Ca²+] is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the correct answer.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}, \quad K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

The total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M, so at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is approximately 0.02 M, assuming minimal dissociation due to the large \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \). Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) be \(x\). Then:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} \approx \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Substituting \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
