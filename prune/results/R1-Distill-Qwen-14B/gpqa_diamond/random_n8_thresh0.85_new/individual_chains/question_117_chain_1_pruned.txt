Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to recall what I know.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Optical isomers are compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they have chirality. Chirality usually comes from a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl structures can have different substituents on each ring. The substituents here are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, in biphenyls, the arrangement of substituents can create a chiral center if the substituents lead to asymmetry. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. If each ring has two substituents (like the two nitro groups and the two carboxylate esters?), does that create a chiral center? Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it might not be chiral. Wait, in this case, the substituents are 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So on each ring, the groups are at para positions relative to the connecting bond. So each ring would have two substituents opposite each other. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the way the substituents are arranged on each ring could lead to a chiral center. Wait, the central single bond allows for rotation, but in this case, the substituents are in certain positions. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe this compound has a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral. So perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but maybe I'm wrong. Another thought: if the substituents are arranged in such a way that each phenyl ring has groups that make the whole molecule chiral. For example, if each ring has two different groups, and the arrangement across the bond isn't symmetrical. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. So on each ring, the groups are in the ortho and para positions relative to the connecting bond. So on each ring, the arrangement is: methyl ester at position 2, nitro at position 6. So each ring has two substituents. But are these substituents arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is chiral? Or is there a plane of symmetry? If I imagine the molecule, both rings are identical in their substituents, so perhaps it's symmetrical. Wait, no. Wait, if each ring has methyl ester at 2 and nitro at 6, but the connection is such that the two rings are attached at position 1. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are across the ring. So when looking at the molecule, the arrangement would be that each ring has two groups, and the two rings are connected in the middle. But I'm not seeing a clear plane of symmetry here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. Or maybe it has a center of inversion, making it achiral. I'm a bit stuck on this one. Maybe I'll come back to it later.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3O-COOCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, wait no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, it would replace the -OH of the acid with OMe. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Let's see: the central carbon (assuming the chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3), but wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified, it would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure has a central carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl) with groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH2? Wait, no. Let me get the structure right. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is (R) or (S) configuration. Wait, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the central carbon is the one attached to the hydroxyl group. So the groups attached to that carbon are: CH3 (from the adjacent CH3), OH, COOCH3 (from the ester), and the CH2? Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon is the CH(OH) group. The groups attached are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the adjacent carbon (which is attached to COOCH3). Wait, no, the adjacent carbons are: the CH3 is on the same carbon as the OH and COOCH3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it:

The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH) carbon) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and the adjacent carbon (which is the COOCH3 group's carbon? No, wait, the COOCH3 is a single group attached to that carbon. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- OH (up),
- COOCH3 (right),
- and another CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

Carbon chain: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the carbon with the OH is the second carbon in the chain. Its four substituents are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- and the third carbon, which is a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating. Let me think about the groups attached to the CH(OH). So the substituents are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the next carbon in the chain. But wait, the next carbon is a COOCH3 group, which is a carbonyl attached to OCH3. So the substituents on the CH(OH) are:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and the rest?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is: does the central carbon have four different substituents? Let me list them:

The central carbon is attached to:

1. A methyl group (CH3),
2. A hydroxyl group (OH),
3. The carbonyl group (C=O connected to OCH3),
4. And the adjacent carbon (which is connected to the methyl group on the left). Wait, no, the adjacent carbon is the one with the methyl. Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, no. Let's number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

So carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- OH,
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- And what else? Oh, wait, no, carbon 2 is connected to four groups. Wait, carbon 2 is CH(OH), so it's bonded to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- Hydroxyl (OH),
- Carbon 3 (which is connected to the carbonyl group),
- And a hydrogen? No, wait, no. Because the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is actually CH2(OH) maybe? Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So each carbon in the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: C(O)OCH3

Wait, so carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3),
- OH,
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3),
- And another hydrogen? Because it's a CH group?

Wait, no, the formula is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, which would imply that the CH(OH) is a central carbon. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the carbon with OH is the second carbon. Its substituents are:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- And a hydrogen. Wait, but a carbon can't have four bonds if it's CH. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH(OH), which has two CH3 groups? No, that doesn't make sense. I'm getting a bit stuck here
