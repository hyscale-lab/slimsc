Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to think through it.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds like in classical mechanics, right? Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Let me write that down.

So the first astronaut's speed is u = 0.6c, and the second is v = 0.5c. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed of the second astronaut from the first's frame would be u' = (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, let me get that right. If I'm in the first astronaut's frame (moving at u =0.6c), then the second astronaut's speed is v'= (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, actually, u is the speed of the second astronaut in the first's frame. So I think I should calculate u' as (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Let me plug in the values.

So u = 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Wait wait, wait a minute. No, wait. If astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c -0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

That would be (-0.1c) divided by (1 - 0.3) which is 0.7. So the numerator is -0.1c, denominator 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1/0.7)c. But since speed is positive, it's 0.1428c approximately. So about 0.14c. Wait, but the question asks for the relative speed. Oh wait, the sign tells us direction; since it's negative, B is moving slower than A in A's frame. But the speed would be the magnitude, so 0.14c. That's looking at option C and D for the relative speed.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. Each astronaut's total energy is their rest mass energy times gamma. So for each, calculate gamma times mc², then add them.

Wait, wait. The masses are given as 2m and 3m. So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma for him is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) =1/0.8=1.25.

So his energy is 2m * c² * 1.25 = 2.5 mc
