Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out. Alright, the question is about two reactions where a chemist uses different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but wait, no, actually looking again the products are (R) and (S) for each reaction? Wait, no, the first reaction gives (R), the second gives (S). Hmm, no, wait the question says:

The first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ --> (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

The second reaction is B + BH3 + H+ --> (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, so both reactions produce 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one but as different enantiomers. So the product in each case is a specific stereoisomer. I need to find what starting materials A and B must be that, when reduced using LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, give the R and S forms.

Wait, wait, but wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for reducing carbonyl groups. BH3 is a milder one, but often used in specific reductions, maybe in the presence of other things like THF (like in the hydroboration reaction). Oh wait, wait a second. Wait, LiBH4 is used typically for ketones, aldehydes, etc. But BH3 is used in the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which is for alkenes. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, wait, no, the products here are tetrahydro pyran-2-one. So, that's a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones or something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are not ketones but something else. Because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. Oh, wait, wait. Oh, wait another thought: perhaps the starting materials are epoxides? Because LiBH4 can reduce epoxides. Or maybe they're acetals. Hmm. Wait, LiBH4 can also reduce esters or amides, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 is usually used in a protic solvent like
