Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different sequence of reactions. Hmm, let's think this through step by step.

First, I'll try to draw the target molecule. It's 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Let's number the ring. Let's say the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around—wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So the positions are 1,2,3. So substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So I need to figure out the order in which these groups are added to benzene. The key is to consider the directing effects of each substituent, because the order can affect where the next substituent attaches.

Benzene is the starting material. Each substitution reaction will add a new group in a certain position relative to existing substituents, depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta-directing.

Let me think about each substituent's directing effects:

- Ethoxy group (-OEt): It's an activating group (since it's an electron-donating ether), so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

- Nitro group (-NO2): This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

- tert-Butyl group (a bulky alkyl group): This is an activating group (electron-donating by alkyl's inductive effect), so it's ortho/para-directing, but bulky.

Now, the challenge is to add these groups in an order that allows each new group to attach where we want, considering the directing effects of already present substituents.

But wait, the nitro group is deactivating, so it's hard to add after some groups. Let's see. Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it's usually introduced early when the ring is more reactive. Or wait, if we add nitro after a strong activating group, it might be possible. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, let's think about the order of substitution. Let me outline possible steps.

Assuming we start with benzene, the first substituent could be either the ethoxy, tert-butyl, or nitro. Which one would make the next substitution easier?

If I add the ethoxy group first, it's activating, so the next substituent will go into ortho or para to it. But then, adding nitro as the next step—since nitro is meta-directing, but the ethoxy is activating—so the nitro would go in a position depending on the ethoxy's directing.

Wait, but nitration is a strong reaction. Also, if we have multiple substituents, their directing can be influenced by their relative strengths. Like, the strongest director will control where the next group goes.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to add the tert-butyl first because it's a bulky group, but adding it first would allow the next substituent to be in a specific position. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target has three substituents: tert-butyl at 2, ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3. So, looking at the benzene ring, positions 1,2,3 are all adjacent. So, substituents are at 1,2,3 in a row. Hmm, that's a meta arrangement for the nitro and ethoxy? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to first add ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl? Or another order.

Wait, let's think of the possible order:

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Benzene → tert-butyl benzene. Then, add ethoxy. Since tert-butyl is activating and o/p-directing, the ethoxy can go in ortho or para. But if we have three substituents, the positions matter.

But in the target molecule, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, their positions are adjacent. So, perhaps the order is adding substituents in such a way that each new group is added meta to the previous one, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is adding nitro first. But nitro is a strong meta director, so adding it first would make the next substituent go into the meta position relative to nitro. But then, adding ethoxy next, which is activating, which would influence the next substituent.

Wait, maybe the order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Or nitro, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the groups in a way that each new group goes into the correct position based on the current substituents.

Let's outline each possible option's reaction sequence and see which one could lead to the target structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Steps are:

1. tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl)
2. HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)
3. SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)
4. NaNO2/HCl (diazotization)
5. dilute H2SO4
6. H3O+, H2O, Heat (hydrolysis)
7. NaOH/EtBr (ethoxylation via SN2, maybe Williamson)
8. Fe/HCl (probably a reduction step)
9. HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration)

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about each step's purpose.

Wait, when you nitrate a benzene ring, the position depends on existing substituents. So after adding tert-butyl (step 1), the next step is nitration. So tert-butyl is o/p-directing. So nitration would add in ortho or para to tert-butyl. But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. So, perhaps the nitro is added in a position adjacent to the ethoxy or the tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the steps are not in the correct order. Let me think about each option's steps.

Option D:

1. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. Nitro group is added in a position; since benzene is symmetric, but nitro would be in one position. Then,

2. Fe/HCl → this is a reduction. Nitro group to amine? Or maybe something else. Wait, Fe/HCl is a typical condition for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes, but benzene rings don't have ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's for substituting a nitro group. Wait, perhaps nitration first, then Fe/HCl is a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe it's for removing a functional group. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order in which the substituents are added affects the positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, and then the nitro.

Because, ethoxy is activating, so the next substituent (tert-butyl) would go into ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, with ethoxy and tert-butyl on the ring, where would the nitro group add? Nitro is meta-directing, but it's a strong deactivating group, so nitration tends to be done earlier because the ring is more reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is nitro first, but that's tricky because the nitro group is deactivating, making further substitution harder.

Wait, maybe I should think about each substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity. The ethoxy group is strongly activating, so it's easy to add substituents after that. Nitro is deactivating, so it's harder to add substituents after it. Therefore, nitro should be added later, but wait, that's not possible because after nitro is added, the ring is deactivating, making other substitutions difficult.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the target structure again. The substituents are at 1, 2, 3. So, perhaps the ethoxy is added first in position 1. Then, tert-butyl is added in position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy. Then, nitro in position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Wait, but when adding the first substituent, benzene is symmetric. Let's say we add ethoxy first. So ethoxy is at position 1. Now, the ring has an activating group, so the next substituent (say, tert-butyl) would be added in the ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) position relative to ethoxy. Suppose tert-butyl is added in position 2. Now, the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2.

Now, the next step is to add the nitro group. The ring now has two substituents: ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta director. So where would it go?

The existing substituents are activating, so the ring is more reactive, but the nitro group is a strong deactivator, so it needs to be added in a position where the directing effect is possible.

Wait, but nitro is meta-directing. So, considering the positions, where would the nitro group go when both ethoxy and tert-butyl are present?

Wait, the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So positions 3 and 4 are adjacent to position 2 and 1. Hmm, if the nitro is added in position 3, which is adjacent to both substituents, that would make it 1,2,3.

But the directing effect depends on the substituents' positions. The existing substituents would direct the incoming nitro group to certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl. But then, the ring might not be in the best position to add nitro because the ring is activated by two substituents, but nitro is a strong deactivator.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each option's reaction sequence and see which makes sense.

Looking at option D:

1. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Fe/HCl → probably reduction of nitro group to amine. So now, we have aniline (aminobenzene).

3. tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. AlCl3 is a catalyst for electrophilic substitution. But wait, aniline is strongly activating, but if the ring is already activated, maybe it's possible.

Wait, benzene → nitrobenzene (step 1). Then, step 2: Fe/HCl → nitro group is reduced to amine, giving aniline. Aniline is a strong activating group, so it's good for further substitution.

Step 3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So, adding tert-butyl to the aniline ring. But aniline is highly activating, so the t-butyl group would add in the ortho or para position relative to the amine. However, in the target compound, the tert-butyl is at position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy at 1. Hmm.

Wait, after nitro is reduced to amine (position 1), adding t-butyl would likely go in the para position (since aniline is ortho/para-directing). But then, the ethoxy would need to go somewhere else, but in the target, it's at position 1. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added later. Let's see the steps. Option D continues:

4. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again. But wait, after the ring has an amine (from step 2), which is a strong activating group. So nitration would occur in the positions directed by the amine. But if you have an amine, nitration would lead to a nitro group in ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but this seems to be adding a second nitro group, which is not part of the target. The target has only one nitro group. So maybe option D isn't correct.

Let me check another option, say option B.

Option B:

1. tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → add tert-butyl group to benzene.

2. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, the ring has tert-butyl and nitro groups.

3. Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

4. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again (which seems odd).

Wait, but the target has nitro, t-butyl, and ethoxy. So this doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm not tracking the steps correctly.

Option C:

1. tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

2. SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Sulfonic acid group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So now the ring has t-butyl and sulfonic acid.

3. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Where would the nitro group go? The sulfonic acid is meta-directing, the t-butyl is ortho/para. So the nitro would go in a position influenced by both.

After nitration, step 4 is Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine.

Hmm, perhaps not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to first add ethoxy, then nitro, then t-butyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added last because in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, which is adjacent to t-butyl and nitro at 2 and 3. So, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced after adding the other groups.

Wait, but the ethoxy group is a strong activating group, so it would be easier to add later when the ring is less deactivating. Or wait, no—if the ring is already deactivating due to nitro, adding ethoxy would require a more reactive ring. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the order in which substituents are added must allow each new group to enter the correct position as directed by the existing substituents.

Let's assume that we add nitro group last because the ring is more deactivating, making it harder to add substituents after that. So, the sequence would be ethoxy, tert-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, nitro is a deactivating group, so if we add it last, it would be difficult to add because the ring would be more activated by ethoxy and t-butyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced first. Let me try to imagine that.

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Then, introduce ethoxy. Since nitro is meta-directing, the ethoxy would add in the meta position relative to the nitro. So, nitro at position 1, ethoxy would be at 3 or 4.

Wait, benzene is a ring. If we have nitro at position 1, then ethoxy would be added in position 3 or 4, which are meta to nitro. Let's say ethoxy is added at position 3.

Now, the ring has nitro (1) and ethoxy (3). Now, the ethoxy is activating, which is ortho/para-directing. The nitro is deactivating, meta-directing. So the next substituent (t-butyl) would be directed by the activating ethoxy, which is in position 3. So, t-butyl would add in ortho (position 2 or 4) or para (position 6) relative to ethoxy.

But in the target, t-butyl is at position 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy (pos 1). Wait, no, in the target, t-butyl is at 2, ethoxy at 1, nitro at 3. So if ethoxy is added after nitro, that would be at position 3, and then t-butyl would be at position 2. Hmm, but that would make the substituents at 1 (nitro?), no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then nitro, then t-butyl.

Let me try to outline that:

1. Ethoxylation of benzene: benzene → ethoxybenzene.

2. Nitration: nitro group adds in the meta position relative to ethoxy. So, ethoxy at position 1, nitro at position 3.

3. Add t-butyl group: the directing would be influenced by ethoxy and nitro. Ethoxy is activating (ortho/para), nitro is deactivating (meta).

So, the t-butyl group would go where? The ethoxy directs ortho/para, but the nitro group is in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy. So, the t-butyl could go in the ortho position relative to ethoxy (position 2) or para (position 4), but the nitro is at 3, which is adjacent to 2 and 4. Hmm, but perhaps the t-butyl would go in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy at 1 and adjacent to nitro at 3. That would give the target structure.

So, the steps would be:

i) Ethoxylation (add ethoxy to benzene).

ii) Nitration (add nitro meta to ethoxy).

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add t-butyl, which goes ortho to ethoxy.

But looking at the options, which option follows this order?

Looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option A:

1. t-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → add t-butyl.

2. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate.

3. SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonate.

Wait, that's not matching. We were thinking of adding ethoxy first.

Option B:

1. t-butyl.

2. nitrate.

3. Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

Not matching our desired order.

Option C:

1. t-butyl.

2. sulfonate.

3. nitrate.

Hmm, no, not the order we need.

Option D:

1. nitrate.

2. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

3. t-butyl.

So, D starts with nitro, then t-butyl. But earlier, we were thinking to add ethoxy first. So D doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps none of the options are adding ethoxy first. Hmm. Let me look again at the options to see if any of them involve ethoxylation.

Wait, looking at the reagents in the options. The only reagents that suggest adding an ethoxy group are steps with NaOH and EtBr, which is a typical condition for an SN2 reaction, perhaps for introducing an ethoxy group via Williamson synthesis or ethoxylation, but that would require a good leaving group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, such as using NaOH and ethyl bromide (EtBr), which would substitute a leaving group, like a nitro group, but that's not possible because nitro isn't a leaving group. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, but nucleophilic aromatic substitution requires strong activating groups (like NH2) which are not present here. So perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride? No, because Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation with an alkyl halide, but ethoxy is an ether. Alternatively, perhaps it's introduced via a substitution after a nitration or sulfonation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added as the last step via an ethoxy group introduction via a substitution reaction. For example, using NaOH and EtBr, which is a common condition for Williamson ether synthesis when you have a good leaving group, like a tosylate or a nitrate.

Wait, but in which position would the ethoxy group be added?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction. Let's think: nitro groups are meta directors, so if the ring has a nitro group, and a leaving group is introduced, say, in a position ortho to the nitro, then a substitution with ethoxide could occur.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's tricky without a strong activating group.

Wait, looking at the options, in option A, step vii is NaOH/EtBr. So perhaps step vii is where the ethoxy group is added via an SN2 mechanism, replacing a bromide. But for that to happen, there must be a bromide substituent on the ring.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve introducing a bromide first, then substituting it with ethoxy.

Hmm, that's a possibility. Let me think about that.

If the ring has a bromide at a certain position, and then in a substitution reaction with EtBr and NaOH, the bromide is replaced by ethoxy.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Add tert-butyl.

2. Nitrate.

3. Add a bromide.

4. Substitute bromide with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add tert-butyl, then ethoxy, then nitrate. Let's see.

If we add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy. The ethoxy would go ortho or para to the tert-butyl. Then nitrate, which is meta to ethoxy and maybe para to tert-butyl.

But in the target, the nitro is at position 3, and the ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So perhaps after adding ethoxy at position 1 and tert-butyl at 2, nitration would occur at position 3, which is adjacent to 2 and meta to 1.

But how would that happen? Because ethoxy is activating and in position 1, directs to 2,4,6. But the ring already has a tert-butyl at 2, so the nitro would go to position 3, which is adjacent to 2 and next to 4 and 6. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the order is: add nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. Let's see:

1. Nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Ethoxy added in the meta position → so nitro at 1, ethoxy at 3.

3. Now, add tert-butyl. The ring has nitro at 1 (deactivating, meta) and ethoxy at 3 (activating, ortho/para). The tert-butyl would be directed by the ethoxy, perhaps to position 2 (ortho to ethoxy at 3) or position 4 (para to ethoxy at 3). But in the target, tert-butyl is at 2, which is adjacent to ethoxy at 1 and nitro at 3. Hmm, but in this scenario, ethoxy is at 3, not 1, so that doesn't fit.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should try to figure out which option's steps produce the correct substituent order.

Looking at option D:

The steps are:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation → add t-butyl to aniline.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vi) H3O+, H2O, Heat → hydrolysis (maybe to form a nitro group again?).

vii) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps sulfation.

viii) H3O+, H2O, Heat → maybe hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

I don't see where the ethoxy group comes in. So option D might not be correct.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride → add t-butyl.

ii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) HNO3 → nitrate again.

v) NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

viii) SO3 → sulfonate.

ix) dilute H2SO4 → perhaps desulfonation.

Hmm, not sure about this.

Option A:

i) t-butyl.

ii) nitrate.

iii) sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 → diazo.

v) dilute H2SO4.

vi) H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr.

viii) Fe/HCl.

ix) HNO3 → nitrate.

Again, not sure.

Option C:

i) t-butyl.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → nitrate.

vii) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4.

ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm, perhaps the ethoxy is added in step ix via substitution.

Wait, let's think about this: if the ring has a nitro group (from step iii), then after reduction (iv), it's an amine. Then, diazotization (v) gives a diazonium salt. Step vi: HNO3 → perhaps another nitration? That seems odd.

Alternatively, maybe step vi is a hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol, but that requires specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

i) Add t-butyl to benzene.

ii) Sulfonate → add a sulfonic acid group (SO3).

iii) Nitrate → add nitro group.

iv) Reduce nitro to amine.

v) Diazotize (form diazonium salt).

vi) Hydrolyze diazonium salt to phenol.

vii) Hydrolysis again, not sure.

viii) Dilute H2SO4 → maybe sulfonation.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution to add ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the order that leads to the correct substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution in step ix, replacing a nitro group. But that's not possible because nitro is not a leaving group. Unless a nitro group is converted into a better leaving group, like a nitroso, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating groups are present. For example, after the ring has a -NH2 group, which is a strong activating group, then a nitro group could be introduced in a certain position, and then a substitution could occur.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy group to benzene.

2. Nitrate → add nitro meta to ethoxy.

3. Add tert-butyl ortho to ethoxy.

But looking at the options, do any of them follow this?

Option C's steps:

i) t-butyl.

ii) sulfonate.

iii) nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro.

v) NaNO2.

vi) nitrate again.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added last, via a substitution reaction, replacing a bromide that was introduced earlier.

Wait, looking at option A's steps:

Step vii) NaOH/EtBr → perhaps this is where the ethoxy is introduced via SN2, replacing a bromide.

So, perhaps the bromide is introduced earlier. Let's see:

Step i) add t-butyl.

Step ii) nitrate → nitro group.

Step iii) sulfonate → add sulfonic acid.

Step iv) NaNO2 → diazotize.

Step v) dilute H2SO4 → hydrolyze.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A or D.

Wait, the target molecule has the nitro group at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and t-butyl at 2.

So, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl to benzene.

2. Nitrate → nitro group added in a position directed by t-butyl.

3. Add ethoxy in a position directed by the existing substituents.

But let's see. Adding t-butyl first, which is o/p-directing. Nitration would add nitro in ortho or para to t-butyl. Let's say nitro is para to t-butyl, at position 4. Now, the ring has t-butyl (position 2) and nitro (position 4). Then, adding ethoxy. Since nitro is meta-directing and t-butyl is o/p, where would ethoxy go?

Hmm, perhaps ethoxy would go in the meta position relative to nitro (position 1 or 3). But then, the ring would have t-butyl at 2, nitro at 4, and ethoxy at 1 or 3. But the target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting the correct order.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add nitro group.

2. Add t-butyl in a position ortho to nitro, which would be position 2 if nitro is at 1.

3. Add ethoxy in the meta position relative to t-butyl, which would be position 4 or 6. But that doesn't fit the target.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should think about each step's purpose in the options.

Looking for when ethoxy is introduced. The reagents that add ethoxy are steps with NaOH and EtBr. So, perhaps in some options, ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction.

Option A's step vii is NaOH/EtBr. So, perhaps the ethoxy is added at this step, substituting a bromide.

So, when would the bromide be present? Maybe after a nitration and some other steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence involves nitration, then sulfonation, then substitution.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the right order. Maybe option D is correct, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps option B.

Wait, another approach: the target has three substituents. Let's count the number of substituents in each option's steps.

Option D:

Step i: nitro.

Step ii: reduce to amine.

Step iii: add t-butyl.

Then, step iv: nitrate again.

But the target has one nitro group, so that might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is nitro, then ethoxy, then t-butyl via Friedel-Crafts.

But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it introduces nitro first, then t-butyl, then ethoxy via substitution. Let me think.

Option D steps:

i. Nitration → nitro group.

ii. Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii. Friedel-Crafts with tert-butyl → add t-butyl.

iv. Nitrate again → another nitro group. No, target has only one.

Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

Add ethoxy first, then nitro, then t-butyl.

Looking for an option that has ethoxy added after nitro.

Wait, but none of the options have ethoxylation steps after nitration except maybe via substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, which includes a sulfonation step, which is a common step in certain reaction sequences.

Wait, but sulfonic acid groups are typically used as leaving groups in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring (like with amino groups).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl.

2. Nitration.

3. Sulfonation.

4. Reduction.

5. Diazotization.

6. Hydrolysis.

7. Ethoxylation via substitution.

But I'm not seeing which option follows this.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct.

Option B:

i. t-butyl.

ii. nitrate.

iii. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv. HNO3 → nitrate again.

v. NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi. H3O+ → hydrolysis (like to form phenol).

vii. NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

viii. SO3 → sulfonate.

ix. dilute H2SO4.

Hmm, step vii might be adding ethoxy, but I'm not sure how that leads to the target.

Wait, perhaps after adding ethoxy in step vii, the substituents are in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: think about the nitro group's position. The target has nitro at position 3. So, the nitro must have been introduced in a position directed by the earlier substituents.

If the first substituent is ethoxy, then nitro would be added meta to ethoxy, which would be position 3 or 4. Suppose it's position 3.

Then, adding t-butyl would be ortho to ethoxy, which is position 2.

So, the substituents would be 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro). That's the target.

So, the steps would be: ethoxylation → nitration → t-butyl.

Looking for an option where the steps are ethoxylation, then nitration, then t-butyl.

But looking at the options, none of them start with ethoxylation. So perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after the other groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A.

Option A's steps:

i. t-butyl → add t-butyl.

ii. nitrate → nitro group.

iii. sulfonate → add sulfonic acid.

iv. NaNO2 → diazotize.

v. dilute H2SO4 → hydrolyze (maybe to form a phenol).

vi. H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

vii. NaOH/EtBr → add ethoxy via substitution.

viii. Fe/HCl → reduction.

ix. HNO3 → nitrate again.

Hmm, perhaps after step vii, the ethoxy is added. But I'm not sure about the positions.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C.

Option C's steps:

i. t-butyl.

ii. SO3 → sulfonate.

iii. nitrate.

iv. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro.

v. NaNO2 → diazotize.

vi. nitrate again.

vii. H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii. dilute H2SO4.

ix. NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

So, the ethoxy is added last. When would that happen?

After adding sulfonic acid (ii), nitrate (iii), then reduce (iv), diazo (v), hydrolysis (vi, vii), and then ethoxylation (ix).

Hmm, but I'm not seeing how that leads to the correct substituent positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, going back to the target structure, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the nitro first, then the t-butyl, then the ethoxy.

But that would require nitro being added first, then t-butyl in a position relative to nitro, which is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the nitro is added first, then t-butyl, then ethoxy via substitution.

In that case, the steps would be:

1. Nitration → nitro group.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl.

3. Substitution to add ethoxy.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D:

i. Nitrate → nitro group.

ii. Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii. Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl.

iv. nitrate again → another nitro group? No, target has one.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps option C:

i. t-butyl.

ii. sulfonate.

iii. nitrate.

iv. reduce → amine.

v. diazo.

vi. nitrate again.

Hmm, not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has two substituents that are activating (t-butyl and ethoxy) and one deactivating (nitro). So, the nitro must have been added after the activating groups, making it difficult because the ring is deactivating. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro was added first, making the ring less reactive, but then adding the activating groups.

But that might not work because activating groups are easier to add when the ring is more reactive.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro was added last, but that would have required the ring to be activated by the other groups, which might not be possible.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

So, ethoxy → t-butyl → nitro.

In that case, after ethoxy and t-butyl are added, the ring has two activating groups. Then, nitration would be possible, with the nitro group adding in the position directed by the existing substituents.

Assuming ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at position 2.

Now, the ring is activated by both groups. So, nitration would occur. The nitro group is meta to ethoxy (position 3 or 5), but also influenced by t-butyl's directing.

Since t-butyl is at 2, which is ortho to ethoxy at 1, the nitro group would be directed by both. I'm not sure exactly where it would go, but perhaps position 3, which is adjacent to both ethoxy (position 1) and t-butyl (position 2). So, that would give the desired structure.

So, the steps would be:

1. Ethoxylation.

2. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl.

3. Nitration.

Looking at the options, none of the options start with ethoxylation. All options start with either nitration or alkylation. So, perhaps the correct option is not present, but I must choose among the given options.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution step, such as step vii in option C.

Option C's steps:

i. t-butyl.

ii. sulfonate.

iii. nitrate.

iv. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v. NaNO2 → diazo.

vi. nitrate again.

vii. H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis.

viii. dilute H2SO4.

ix. NaOH/EtBr → ethoxylation.

Hmm, perhaps after all those steps, the ethoxy is added in position 1, but I'm not sure. It seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I can't see how.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct sequence of substituents.

The target has substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-butyl), 3 (nitro).

Each substituent is in the ortho or meta position relative to the others.

So, perhaps the nitro is added in the meta position relative to the ethoxy, which was added first.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy (step: ethyl chloride via SN2? Or perhaps via an electrophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.)

Wait, I'm not seeing any option that starts with ethoxylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is B.

Option B:

i. t-butyl.

ii. nitrate.

iii. Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv. nitrate again.

Wait, this seems to be adding two nitro groups, which isn't right.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Based on the target structure, the nitro group is meta to the ethoxy. So, the ethoxy must have been added before the nitro, as it's activating and would direct the nitro group to the meta position.

So, the sequence must involve adding ethoxy first, then nitro, then t-butyl.

Looking through the options, perhaps none of them directly do this, but perhaps the correct option is C or D.

Wait, in option D, step iii is adding t-butyl after nitration and reduction. Let me think:

D's steps:

i. nitro → nitrobenzene.

ii. Fe/HCl → aniline.

iii. t-butyl → Friedel-Crafts: aniline is a strong activating group, so t-butyl would add in ortho or para to amine.

So, suppose t-butyl is added in position 4 (para to amine in position 1).

Now, step iv. HNO3 → nitrate again. So, with aniline (position 1), t-butyl (position 4), where would nitro go? It would be in ortho or para to the amine, but position 2 and 6 are available. However, position 3 is adjacent to t-butyl at 4.

But this doesn't seem to lead to the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps option B is correct.

Wait, I'm really stuck. I'll have to pick the option that seems most plausible based on the steps.

Wait, another observation: the target molecule has a tert-butyl group, which is bulky. Friedel-Crafts alkylation can sometimes be problematic with bulky groups, but it's possible.

If the correct order is ethoxylation first, then nitration, then t-butyl, but none of the options have that, perhaps the correct option is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is nitration first, then ethoxy via substitution, then t-butyl.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after nitration. For that, the ring would need a leaving group, like a nitro group. But nitro isn't a good leaving group. Unless it's converted into a better one.

Wait, maybe after nitration, the nitro group is converted into a nitroso group, which is a better leaving group. Then, in a substitution reaction, the nitroso group is replaced by ethoxy. But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps after nitration, a sulfonic acid group is added, which is a good leaving group. Then, in a substitution reaction, the sulfonic acid is replaced by ethoxy.

Looking at option A:

i. t-butyl.

ii. nitrate.

iii. sulfonate.

iv. NaNO2 → diazo.

v. dilute H2SO4 → hydrolysis to make a phenol.

vi. H3O+/H2O → hydrolysis again.

vii. NaOH/EtBr → substitution to add ethoxy.

So, after step iii, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid.

Then, step iv: diazotization. But nitro is present, so perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is a better leaving group. So, in step vii, the sulfonic acid is replaced by ethoxy.

But I'm not sure about the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain.

After all this, I'm going to make an educated guess that the correct answer is option D.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must ensure that each substituent is added in the correct position relative to the others, considering the directing effects of the substituents. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group at position 1, a tert-butyl group at position 2, and a nitro group at position 3. The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are activating (ortho/para-directing), while the nitro group is deactivating (meta-directing).

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Begins with the addition of a tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation.
   - Followed by nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, hydrolysis, and substitution with ethoxy via NaOH/EtBr.
   - The sequence introduces the ethoxy group late in the process, but the positions of the substituents do not align with the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - Starts with tert-butyl addition, followed by nitration, reduction of nitro to amine, and subsequent nitration again.
   - The addition of ethoxy occurs later, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the correct positions of the substituents.

3. **Option C**:
   - Begins with tert-butyl addition, followed by sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, and hydrolysis.
   - The ethoxy group is added last via NaOH/EtBr. However, the sequence does not clearly establish the correct positions of the substituents.

4. **Option D**:
   - Starts with nitration to introduce the nitro group.
   - Followed by reduction of nitro to amine, Friedel-Crafts alkylation to add tert-butyl, and subsequent nitration again.
   - While the sequence introduces the nitro group first, the positions of the substituents do not align with the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, based on the reasoning and the steps provided, **Option D** appears to be the most plausible choice, despite some uncertainties in the exact positioning of the substituents.
