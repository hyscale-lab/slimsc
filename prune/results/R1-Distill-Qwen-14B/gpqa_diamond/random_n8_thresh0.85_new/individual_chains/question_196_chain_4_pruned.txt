Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But wait, this question is relativistic, so I need to consider how relativity affects things.

The problem is asking for the maximum speed of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about what I know.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. Setting that equal to (1/2)mv_max² gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't just use the classical formula.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I need to use relativistic energy equations. The total energy in relativity is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but relativistically, we might have to consider the total energy including rest mass energy. Wait, but how does the potential energy fit in? Oh right, in the relativistic scenario, the total energy includes both kinetic and potential energy. So the total mechanical energy E should be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, but I'm a bit confused about how potential energy factors in.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. So when the oscillator is at x = A, all its energy is potential, and when it's at x=0, all is kinetic. But in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So maybe I should set the total energy at x=0 equal to the total energy at x=A.

At maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The total energy E would then be the sum of rest energy (mc²) and potential energy (1/2 kA²), right? Or wait, maybe in relativity, the total energy includes both rest mass energy and the potential energy. So
