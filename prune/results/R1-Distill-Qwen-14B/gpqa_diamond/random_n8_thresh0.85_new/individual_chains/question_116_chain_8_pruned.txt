Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting (like triplet or quartet) tells us about neighboring protons. So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H—probably a CH3 group. Triplets often come from two neighboring protons, like in a CH2 group. Wait, but 6H suggests maybe two equivalent CH3 groups? Because a triplet would mean each is next to a CH2. So maybe something like (CH3)2CHCH2...? Or perhaps a di-substituted alkane.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means three neighboring protons. So if 4H, perhaps two CH2 groups each coupled to another CH2. Wait, 4H in a quartet—like a -CH2CH2- group. Because each CH2 is next to another CH2, so each would be a quartet. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: A quartet (n=3) implies each proton has 3 equivalent neighbors. So maybe each of the 4H is part of a CH2 next to a CH2 group, which has two H's. But wait, each H in a CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2's H's. So for a CH2CH2 group, each would be a triplet, not a quartet. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the integration. 6H as triplet and 4H as quartet. 6H is likely two equivalent CH3 groups. So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2(C H3)2. Wait, that's not making much sense. Let me think about common structures. Oh wait, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, because that would have more H's. Alternatively, maybe diethyl something? Wait, wait. Let me think about a compound where there are two different sets of Hs: a triplet from CH3 groups and a quartet from a middle CH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is something
