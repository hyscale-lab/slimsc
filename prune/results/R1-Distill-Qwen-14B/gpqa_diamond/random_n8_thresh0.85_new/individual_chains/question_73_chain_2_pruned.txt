Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity, which I find a bit tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different values for relative speed and total energy.

Hmm, right. I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. You can't just subtract them like you would in classical mechanics because of the speed limit c. So the relative speed isn't as simple as 0.6c minus 0.5c, which would be 0.1c. Because that's probably not considering the relativistic effects. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the formula for adding velocities. Let me recall. If you have two objects moving at speeds u and v relative to a rest frame, their relative speed isn't u-v, but something else. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, wait. Or is it (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/c²) when they're moving in the same direction? No, no, wait. For same direction, the relative speed is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Because if one is moving at u and the other at v in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of the faster object would be (u - v) divided by that factor.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. The velocity addition formula is for transforming between different inertial frames. So if the first astronaut is moving at u = 0.6c, and the second at v = 0.5c in the same direction, then from the frame of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

I think the formula is (v - u)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Because the first frame is moving at u, and the second at v. So the relative velocity would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, but since u and v are in the same direction, if you're moving at u and looking at v, which is slower, then their relative speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Hmm, but wait, u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So v is less than u. So the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) )= (-0.1c)/(0.7) )= -0.1428... c. But since speed is magnitude, we take 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's a start.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Since each is moving at their respective speeds, their energies would be gamma times their rest mass energy.

Wait, energy is the total energy, so for each astronaut, it's gamma * m_rest * c². So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c. Their gamma factor is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

The second astronaut has mass 3m, moving at 0.5c. Their gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So their energy is approximately 1.1547 * 3m * c² = 3.464 m c².

Adding these together, 2.5 + 3.464 is about 5.964 m c². So the total energy would be approximately 5.96 m c². Now, looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc² and same v_rel. So option C and D have v_rel correct. So the correct answer would be option C, because 5.96 matches the calculated value.

Wait, but let me double-check the energy calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First astronaut: mass 2m, velocity 0.6c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Energy: 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c². That's correct.

Second astronaut: mass 3m, velocity 0.5c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) = approximately 1.154700538.

So energy is 1.
