Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are various symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my molecular symmetry, but I'll try to work through it.

Let me list out what I know from the reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So the reaction is A + 8B → C. I'm thinking, what solid reacts with 8 equivalents of gas to form a red product? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something, but wait, sulfur is bright yellow. Or maybe it's a transition metal compound?

Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents suggests a high ratio. Like, maybe B is a diatomic gas. For instance, if B is O2, but 8 moles would be a lot. Alternatively, maybe B is H2? But I'm not sure yet.

2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. E is dangerous, so maybe it's something like a toxic gas or a strong acid. But wait, E is a product from another reaction.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, C + H2O → A + F + G.

What could C be? Let's think about what when a compound reacts with water to form two acids. Maybe C is a sulfide? Or perhaps a metal sulfide? Because when some metal sulfides react with water, they produce H2S (a weak acid) and a metal hydroxide, which might not be an acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, maybe C is a nitride? Because nitrides can react with water to produce NH3 (a weak base, not acid), but maybe if it's something else.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfite or sulfate. Hmm, no, maybe not. Alternatively, if C is something like CaS. Wait, if C is CaS, then reacting with water would give Ca(OH)2 and H2S. But H2S is a weak acid, and Ca(OH)2 is a base, so maybe F is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide. If C is a metal oxide, reacting with water might form a metal hydroxide and possibly release H2O, but that doesn't seem to form two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal nitride. For example, Mg3N2. Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. So that might not fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide, like FeS. FeS + H2O → Fe(OH)2 and H2S. Fe(OH)2 is not an acid, it's a base. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is an acid salt. Like sodium sulfide? Na2S reacting with water? No, that would just stay as Na2S and water. Or perhaps another compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. But reacting with water wouldn't produce two acids.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it produces two acids. So maybe C is a compound that can act as both a salt of a strong acid and a salt of a weak acid. For example, suppose C is a nitrate and a chloride? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfonate? Or perhaps a more complex structure.

Alternatively, think about the first reaction: A + 8B → C. So, maybe A is Fe, B is O2. So 4Fe + 3O2 → 2Fe2O3. But that's 3 equivalents of O2 per Fe, but the problem says 8 equivalents. So not quite.

Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur and B is something else. Sulfur reacting with a gas. Maybe B is O2? Then, A is S8 (the form of sulfur as an octagon), which reacts with O2 to form SO3^2- or SO4^2-? Hmm.

Wait, bright red product C. Sulfur is bright yellow, but maybe another compound. Oh! I remember that when Group 2 metals react with O2, they form oxides. For example, CaO, which is white, not red. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is with another gas.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of Na with Cl2 gas. 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. But that's 1 equivalent, not 8. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2. So 8 moles of Cl2 reacting with A. Let's see, perhaps A is a metal that forms a +1 or +2 ion.

If A is, say, Al, and B is Cl2. 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. But that's 3 equivalents of Cl2. But the problem states 8 equivalents. Hmm.

Wait, 8 equivalents is a high ratio. Maybe B is something diatomic, so 8 moles would correspond to 4 diatomic molecules. So for each mole of A, 8 moles of B are used. So, in terms of stoichiometry, the formula would be A B8.

Wait, that might not make sense for most elements, but perhaps for something like sulfur. S8 (the solid) reacting with O2? No, that would be S8 plus O2 to form SO3 or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, like O2, and the product C is a metal oxide where the metal has a high oxidation state.
