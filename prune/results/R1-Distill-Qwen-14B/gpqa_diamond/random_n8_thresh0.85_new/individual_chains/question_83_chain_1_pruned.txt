Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question involves diluting acetic acid, then titrating it with NaOH, and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So titration should involve a buffer solution before the equivalence point and maybe something else after.

First, let's read the problem again carefully. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH.

I need to find the pH at two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point. 

Let me break this down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Molarity (M) is moles per liter. So moles = Molarity × Volume(L). The initial volume is 20 cm³ = 0.02 L. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Step 2: After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration of acetic acid becomes:

Molarity = moles / volume (L) = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So now, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, which is a strong base, it'll react with the acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of CH3COOH present. So let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of CH3COOH, moles of NaOH needed are 0.001.

Volume of NaOH = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So for 25% titration, we're adding 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So the volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³.

At 25% titration, how much of the acetic acid has reacted?

The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. So since the reaction is 1:1, 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have been neutralized, producing 0.00025 moles of acetate (CH3COO^-).

So the initial moles were 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate produced would be 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point includes the original 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, but wait, adding NaOH, which is a strong base, to the solution. Since the solution is a buffer (weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is given by the Ka of acetic acid. The Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733. 

So at 25% titration, the pH is pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

[A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M
[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. 

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Let me round that to 4.26.

So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate.

Wait, but sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it's a basic solution. When dissolved in water, the acetate ions will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The pH can be calculated using the
