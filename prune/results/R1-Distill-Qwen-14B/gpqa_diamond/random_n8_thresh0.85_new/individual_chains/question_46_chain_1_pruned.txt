Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically about Grubbs catalyst and what products you get when a racemic mixture is treated with it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of the two enantiomers. But wait, does that matter for the reaction? Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? So the double bond is where the action is.

3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent means five carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH₂=CH-C(H)(CH₂CH3) something? Wait, wait. Let me get that right. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong. Wait, pent means five carbons in a row. So 1,2 double bond, and a methyl group on the third carbon.

So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait wait, no, wait. Let me count. 1, 2 (double bond), 3 (with a methyl), then 4 and 5. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: C= (double bond)
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Now, adding a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe. Alternatively, it's (CH₂)₂CHCH(CH3)? No, perhaps I should write it as CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, wait, perhaps I should think of the main chain as five carbons, with the double bond at 1-2, and a methyl branch at position 3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3
