Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, the question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which is determined by the RV method. So I know their minimum masses are equal. Their orbital periods are different—Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is orbiting much faster, right?

Both have circular orbits. That's important because eccentricity affects the transit probability, but if they're both circular, I don't have to worry about that factor.

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But wait, both stars have the same radius. Hmm, so Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger. Oh, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something, but they ended up with the same radius. That probably affects other factors.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the star and the orbital distance.

The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² * (1 / (1 - (R_planet / a)^2 ))^½ or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but I'm not exactly sure. Or wait, the geometric probability is given by (R_p / a)^2, but that's the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star's disk, but that's just the cross-section. Wait, no, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R_p / a) * (R_p / R_star), but I might be getting that wrong.

Wait, I think the correct expression for the transit probability is (R_p / R_star)² multiplied by (1 / (1 - (R_p/a)² )) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_star)² * ( (1 + (R_p/R_star) ) / (1 - (R_p²/(a²))^(1/2)) ) ), but maybe that's getting too detailed.

Wait, I think the key factors are the planet's orbital distance and the star's size. The closer the planet is to the star (smaller 'a'), the higher the probability of a transit because the planet's path is more likely to cross our line of sight. Because for a given star, a planet with a smaller orbital period is closer in (since period relates to a via Kepler's third law).

So let's think about Kepler's third law. The period squared is proportional to (a^3)/(M_star). So P² = (4π²/G M) a³. So a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²). Since M is mass of the star.

For Planet_1, P1 = P_2 /3. So a1³ = (G * (2 M_2) * (P_2/3)^2 )/(4π²). For Planet_2, a2³ = (G M_2 P_2²)/(4π²).

Wait, let me write it down more clearly.

Kepler's third law: (P/(2π))² = a³/(G M). So P² = (4π² a³)/(G M). So a³ = (G M P²)/(4π²).

So for Planet_1, a1³ = (G * (2M_2) * (P1)^2 ) / (4 π² )

But P1 = P2 /3. So a1³ = (G * 2 M_2 * (P2²/9) ) / (4 π² )

= (2 M_2 G P2² )/(4 π² * 9 )

Which is (2/36) * (M_2 G P2²)/(4 π²) ) → (1/18) * [ M_2 G P
