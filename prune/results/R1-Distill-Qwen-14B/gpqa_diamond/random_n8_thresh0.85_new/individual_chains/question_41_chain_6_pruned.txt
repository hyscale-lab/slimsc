Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says: A light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium might be affected. Oh, but wait, light's speed in a medium is always c divided by the refractive index, right? So normally, the speed is v = c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, does that change the observed speed?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about frames of reference. The glass is moving, so from the lab frame, the observer would see the light moving at a different speed. But wait, isn't the speed of light constant in all inertial frames? Oh, right, that's Einstein's postulate. But wait, that's in a vacuum, right? Because the problem is about a glass medium, which is a different situation.

So when the glass is moving, the light inside it would have a velocity relative to the glass. Let me try to model this. The light's speed in the glass is v = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, no, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer in the lab frame. Oh, no, wait, the question says the glass is moving toward the observer in the lab. So the lab is the rest frame, the glass is moving towards the observer.

Wait, the light beam is in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving towards the observer. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be a combination of its velocity in the glass plus the velocity of the glass.

Wait, no, that's assuming velocities just add up, but that's only valid in non-relativistic speeds. But since the speed of light is involved, maybe we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh, right! Because when dealing with high speeds, you can't just add them like in classical mechanics.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²))

Wait, but in this case, the light's speed in the glass is v
