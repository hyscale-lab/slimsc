Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what's optical isomerism? Oh right, it's when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it can't be superimposed on its mirror image. These compounds are also called enantiomers and they're a type of stereoisomer. So the key here is to find which of the given compounds have chiral centers.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' position. Now, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the 2,2' and 6,6' positions. So each ring has two substituents. Let me imagine the structure. Each phenyl group has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester (O-CO-OCH3) at position 2. The biphenyl is connected in such a way that the substituents are on opposite sides or maybe adjacent. Wait, but does this create any chiral centers?

Wait, the biphenyl structure itself can have some stereochemistry. Oh wait, the biphenyl with substituents in positions that are not symmetric. Let me think: the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. But for each ring, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6. Are these positions symmetric? For a benzene ring, if the substituents are para (like 2 and 6 are across each other if the ring is numbered clockwise), but wait, noâ€” wait, position 2 and 6 are adjacent. Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Let me imagine one ring: substituents at 2 and 6. So maybe the ring is symmetric because of that. But wait, with the biphenyl, if the substituents are on both rings, could this create a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, perhaps the central bond. Wait, the biphenyl's rotation about the central bond can lead to different conformations, but that's not chiral centers. Unless the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry. If each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, then each ring is symmetric. So for each ring, perhaps the substituents are para to each other? Wait, no, 2 and 6 on a benzene ring are ortho to each other. Wait, that's right. Because in a benzene ring, each position is numbered sequentially, so 1 is next to 2 and 6. So 2 and 6 are adjacent (ortho) to each other. So each ring has two ortho substituents.

But wait, in the compound, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent. But wait, if the substituents are
