Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But how do I figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting?

The question says both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method. So, their minimum masses are known, but for the transit probability, I think it's more about the orbital parameters.

Wait, transit probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. Oh right, the probability that we see the transit is roughly (R_planet + R_star)² / (a_planet²), but wait, maybe it's more about the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance? Or is it the impact parameter and the orbital plane's alignment?

Wait, I think the chance that a planet transits its star is roughly the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance, but only considering the edge-on case. So the probability is about the star's radius divided by the planet's orbital distance (a). Wait, no, that's the size of the planet relative to the star. No, maybe the probability is the ratio of the star's size to the distance, so (2R_star/a)²? Because the planet has to pass within the star's disk. So the probability is about (R_star / a)^2? Or is it (R_star + R_planet) but since R_planet is much smaller, maybe just R_star over a.

Wait, maybe the transit probability is given by the formula (R_star / a)^2, but I'm not entirely sure. Or perhaps it's (R_star / a) squared multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_star / a) squared multiplied by the solid angle, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star / a) * something else. Oh, wait, I remember that for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough to cause a transit is given by (R_star / a)^2. Because the area where the orbit must pass in front of the star is a circle of radius R_star, and the total possible area (for the orbital plane) is a circle of radius a. So the probability is (pi R_star^2) / (pi a^2) ) = (
