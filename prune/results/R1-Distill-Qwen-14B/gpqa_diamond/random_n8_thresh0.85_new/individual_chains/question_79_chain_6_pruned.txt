Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after a reaction. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, what's that reagent? Oh right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base used in the formation of epoxides, probably through an acid-catalyzed ring-opening or some elimination reaction. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, that's more like a crown ether, but actually, wait, no. Oh, wait, I think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a base used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, I think it's used as a base in certain elimination reactions or maybe in the formation of epoxides from diols, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in some kind of deprotonation that leads to an elimination reaction, forming an epoxide.

But wait, the product's NMR is given. The options are all epoxides with styryl groups or similar. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation. So, the starting material is probably an alkene, and the product is an epoxide.

Wait, the starting material is compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. Let me check the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Structure would be an oxirane (epoxide) ring attached to a styryl group at position 2. The styryl group is a vinyl benzene. The 4-methyl means a methyl group is attached at the para position relative to the point of attachment.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane has a substituent which is a propenyl group attached to a phenyl. The substituent is at position 1 (so the vinyl is between C1 and C2?), but wait, the structure would be something like cyclopropane attached to a benzene ring via a propenyl group.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane ring has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3. Wait, but oxirane is a three-membered ring, so positions 2 and 3 are adjacent. So the ring would have substituents at 2 and 3—methyl and styryl.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That's an epoxide where the styryl group is attached at position 2 of the epoxide ring. So the epoxide is between two carbons, one of which (say, the left) is attached to the styryl group.

Wait, but the product's formula after reaction isn't given. But the product's NMR is given. The starting material is C11H12O, and the product's formula? Well, if it's an epoxidation, typically an alkene (C=C) is converted into an epoxide (C-O-C). So the formula would change from CnH2m to CnH2m-2O or something, but in any case, the product here must be either an epoxide or some kind of ring-opened product, but given the NMR data, it's likely an epoxide.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, two singlets for 3H each—so likely two methyl groups. One is at 2.28, the other at 2.31. Hmm, very close. Maybe they're on adjacent carbons or similar.

The aromatic region: 6.75 is a doublet (1H), then two doublets at 7.08 (2H) and 7.68 (1H), and another at 7.71 (2H). Wait, that's a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe there's a trans coupling in the aromatic region. Alternatively, perhaps a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents leading to a pattern like ABX or something else.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

- 21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s): these are likely to be the two methyl groups.
- 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s): these are the carbons in the aromatic ring.
- 141.5 and 144.1 (1C each, s): perhaps carbons attached to electronegative atoms, like the epoxide oxygen or carbonyl groups. Wait, but the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl, maybe a ketone? Or an epoxide carbon? Wait, no, epoxide carbons are typically around 60-70 ppm. Wait, but 197 is more like a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. Hmm, but wait, perhaps that's a carbonyl from somewhere else. Oh wait, perhaps it's a carbonyl group, maybe from a ring opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think. If the product is an epoxide, then the 13C NMR should have signals for the two carbons in the epoxide. But in the given data, I don't see any signals in the 50-70 ppm range, which is typical for epoxide carbons. Instead, I see 197.7, which is a carbonyl—so perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but another compound. Alternatively, maybe the 197 is a carbonyl from a ketone or an aldehyde, but that's confusing.

Wait, but looking at the 13C NMR again:

- 21.3 (1C, s) and 28.4 (1C, s): two methyl groups.

- The aromatic carbons: 126.9 (quartet?), 127.1, 129.1, 130.3. Wait, 126.9 is two carbons? Wait, the notation says 126.9 (2C, s). So two carbons at 126.9. Then 127.1 (1C), 129.1 (2C), 130.3 (1C). So total of 6 carbons in the aromatic region.

Wait, that's six? Let me count:

2C (126.9) +1C (127.1) +2C (129.1) +1C (130.3) = 6C.

But a benzene ring has six carbons. So perhaps that's the benzene ring. But let's see the 1H NMR.

In the 1H NMR, the aromatic region:

- 6.75 (d, 1H)
- 7.08 (d, 2H)
- 7.68 (d, 1H)
- 7.71 (d, 2H)

Wait, that's a total of 1 + 2 +1 + 2 =6 H. So that's one H as a doublet, another two as a doublet, another one as a doublet, and two more as a doublet. Hmm, this suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring with substituents that cause splitting into these patterns.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a substituent that's causing a coupling pattern. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene? No, that might not fit the pattern. Alternatively, maybe there are two substituents on the benzene, leading to a pattern where each substituent is meta to each other, or something else.

Wait, the H NMR shows four peaks in the aromatic region, which might suggest that there are two doublets each integrating for two protons, and two more doublets for one proton each. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent on the benzene that leads to a coupling between adjacent protons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that's causing the aromatic protons to split into a pattern with multiple peaks. For example, a para-substituted group would lead to two doublets for the ortho and meta protons.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR:

- 6.75 (d, 1H)
- 7.08 (d, 2H)
- 7.68 (d, 1H)
- 7.71 (d, 2H)

Hmm, if you have two sets of doublets, maybe that's coupling between adjacent aromatic protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that's causing a splitting. Let me try to draw it.

Suppose the benzene ring has two substituents. Let's say, for example, a substituent at position 4 (para) and another at position 2. But that's just a guess.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the 13C NMR. The two methyl groups are at 21.3 and 28.4. These are both CH3 groups attached to either electronegative atoms or perhaps to carbons in the ring.

The 197.7 peak is a carbonyl. So that's probably a ketone or aldehyde group. But in the starting material, the formula is C11H12O. Let's see, the product would be C11H10O2 if it's an epoxide (since epoxide adds an O). Wait, the molecular formula for the product isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not an epoxidation but a different kind of ring-opening or addition. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with an epoxide group—no, that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the product is a styryl ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is some kind of oxidation.

Wait, but looking at the options. Option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which would have an epoxide group attached to the styryl group.

If the product is an epoxide, then the 13C NMR should have peaks in the 60-70 ppm range for the epoxide carbons. But in the provided data, the highest carbon is 197.7, which is a carbonyl. So perhaps that's a ketone. Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclopropane derivative or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: Let me look at the options and see their structures and think about their NMR.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide ring where one oxygen is attached to a styryl group (vinyl benzene) at the 4-methyl position. So the styryl group is attached to the oxirane. The structure would have a benzene ring with a CH2CH2O group attached at the para position, but wait, no, the styryl is CH2-CH2-O, but wait, no, the styryl is more like CH2=CHPh (4-methyl). So the epoxide is between two carbons, one of which is connected to the styryl group.

In that structure, the aromatic region would have a particular pattern. Let's think: the styryl group (vinyl benzene) would have protons on the double bond, and the benzene ring.

Wait,
