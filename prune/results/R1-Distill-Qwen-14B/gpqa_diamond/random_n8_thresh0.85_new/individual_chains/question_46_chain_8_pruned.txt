Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the molecule itself is chiral because of the double bond. Let me draw the structure.

3-methylpent-1-ene. Pentene is five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on C3. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2. Wait, maybe I should write it more accurately.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would add a methyl group to the third carbon. Let me count: the double bond is between 1 and 2. So carbon 3 is the next one. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons? No, wait: 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. No, wait no, how many carbons?

Wait, pent means five carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons: double bond between 1 and 2, then 3 is CH(CH3), 4 is CH2, and 5 is CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, if it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons? Wait, no, that's six.
