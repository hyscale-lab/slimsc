Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I think I can work through it. Let me see what I remember from my astronomy classes.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Hmm, right. Parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of distance (in parsecs). So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away. A star with 0.5 parsec parallax is twice as far, at 2 parsecs.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, perhaps I should think about how the number of stars relates to their distances, considering how density works in three dimensions.

Stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density (stars per unit volume) is the same everywhere. Let's assume that. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume itself.

But how does this translate into parallax? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if I have a range of parallaxes, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Wait, distance d = 1/plx. So plx ranges from plx to plx + dplx correspond to distance ranges from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). But when dplx is small, I can approximate the distance change. Let me think about differentials.

dplx = d(1/d) => dplx = - (1/d²) dd, so dd = -d² dplx. But I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the volume between two spheres (since stars are in all directions) and see how the number of stars relates to parallax.

Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the volume between two spheres with radii r and r + dr is approximately 4π r² dr. Because dr is small, the higher order terms can be neglected.

So, the number of stars in this thin shell (dr) would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume. Since n is uniform, the number N is n * 4π r² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Because plx is 1/r. So r = 1/plx. Let me rewrite everything in terms of plx.

dr = derivative of r with respect to plx. Since r = 1/plx, dr/d plx = -1/(plx)^2. So dr = (-1/(plx)^2) d plx. But since we're considering a small increase in plx (d plx), dr would be negative (as plx increases, distance decreases). But since I'm considering the volume, which is positive, I can take the absolute value, so dr = (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express the volume in terms of plx. Since r = 1/plx, dr = -1/(plx)^2 d plx. So, the volume
