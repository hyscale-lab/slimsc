Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. The initial reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with gas D (2 equivalents) to make E, which is extremely hazardous. C also reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Additionally, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

I need to figure out what these compounds could be based on the reactions. Let's start by identifying each compound.

The first reaction: A + 8B → C. The bright red product makes me think of something like copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, but wait, that's blue. Wait, no, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, could it be a metal reacting with a halogen? Like maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic halogen gas? For example, silver reacting with chlorine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to form a compound with a red color.

Wait, bright red product C. Another thought: perhaps C is a transition metal complex. Like maybe copper(II) oxide is black, but some other copper compound is red. Oh, wait, I think copper(II) sulfate is blue, but perhaps another compound. Alternatively, maybe the product is a nitrate. Wait, another thought: maybe C is a dichromate or something else.

Alternatively, considering the second reaction: C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a highly toxic gas. D is a gas. Let me think about possible reactions. If C is a metal oxide, and D is a halogen, perhaps E is a metal halide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. Let's look at the reaction of C with water. It forms A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with water, it produces a metal (A) and two acids. That suggests that C is probably a salt that can hydrolyze. For example, a nitride might not fit, but perhaps a sulfide? Or maybe it's a metal oxide reacting with water to form a strong acid and another acid.

Wait, no. If C is a nitride, upon reaction with water, it would produce NH3, but that's a base. Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide? Hmm, but peroxides reacting with water might not give acids.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfide, like FeS, but that's more of a solid. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfate, but that wouldn't produce two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, when a nitride of a metal reacts with water, it produces NH3 (a weak base) and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But in the problem, F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So maybe C is not a nitride. What else?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps C is a metal carbonate. When a carbonate reacts with water (though carbonates are usually stable in water), but upon heating, perhaps they decompose. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it forms a metal hydroxide and possibly releases an acid. But wait, if C is a metal oxide, like sodium oxide, reacting with water gives NaOH, which is a strong base, not an acid. That doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a superoxide or another type of oxide. Alternatively, let's think about the reaction of C with water producing two acids. That suggests that C is perhaps a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a nitride of a transition metal. For example, if C is Cu3N, reacting with water would form Cu(OH)2 and NH3. Wait, but NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbide. Metal carbides reacting with water can produce methane (
