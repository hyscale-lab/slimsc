Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is given, which I need to analyze first. The reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, followed by H2O, and then aqueous KOH with heat. I need to identify the final product from the options given.

Wait, let me think about the reaction steps. NaNO2 and HCl are usually involved in diazotization, especially with aromatic amines. Diazonium salts are formed, right? Then, when you add H2O, maybe it's a hydrolysis step. And then aqueous KOH with heat sounds like a kind of elimination or perhaps a substitution reaction. Or wait, maybe it's a Hofmann degradation or something else?

But first, the NMR. Let's look at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift. Could be an aldehyde proton or maybe an acidic proton like an aromatic -OH? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, and they are deshielded, so that might fit.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): downfield aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted benzene rings. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, another doublet. Maybe attached to something else.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet. Maybe some protons on a double bond or an aromatic ring with more substitution, or perhaps some exchangeable protons like -OH groups.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet around 3.66. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an oxygen, like an ether or an aldehyde group? Wait, no, aldehyde H is elsewhere. Or perhaps a CH2 next to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 → (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps I should calculate correctly:

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So formula is C8H9NO.

The calculation: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2. Assuming no halogens here. So:

DoU = [2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1]/2 → (18-9+1)/2 → (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Which can be from rings and double bonds. Five DoU could be, for example, a benzene ring (3 DoU), a double bond (1), and a ring (another 1), or perhaps another double bond. Or maybe one ring and four double bonds? That seems unlikely.

Looking at the NMR data, I see aromatic protons, so a benzene ring is likely. Let's see:

The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests maybe two para-substituted benzene rings. For example, a para-substituted phenyl group where each ring has a substituent in the para position. So perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings, each attached to some other structure.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde group, but wait, an aldehyde proton is usually a singlet, not a triplet. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH group? But that's less likely, or maybe a vinylic proton adjacent to something else.

Wait, the triplet might indicate coupling with two other protons. So if it's an aldehyde proton, maybe it's next to a CH2 group. Like RCHO, where R has a CH2 adjacent. Wait, but in that case, the aldehyde H would typically be a singlet because it's only attached to the carbonyl. Unless the R group has a neighboring CH2 that's splitting it. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents leading to a triplet. Or perhaps it's a vinyl proton adjacent to another proton. For example, in an enal structure, where the aldehyde is conjugated with a double bond.

Wait, let's think. If the molecule has a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, perhaps an aromatic aldehyde. But the triplet suggests something else.

Looking at the 6.27 ppm, broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests exchangeable protons, like -OH groups or perhaps some vinyl protons that are not splitting into sharp peaks. Or maybe protons on a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H: Maybe CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2. Or maybe adjacent to another group. For example, a CH2 group that's part of an ether or ester, or perhaps a carbonyl.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is a diphenyl compound with some substituents. The aldehyde group is present, as indicated by the H around 9.7 ppm. Then the two benzene rings each have substituents, perhaps in the para positions.

Wait, let me try to sketch a possible structure. Maybe it's a diphenyl compound with a carbon chain in between. Let's say two phenyl groups attached to a carbon chain, with an aldehyde group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen.

If it's diphenyl, that's two benzene rings (each 6 carbons, but some are shared). Wait, but diphenyl would be C12, which is more than the given formula. So perhaps it's a single benzene ring. Wait, but the NMR shows two sets of aromatic protons, each a doublet. So maybe the molecule has two benzene rings each substituted, perhaps in a way that each has two protons in a doublet.

Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene ring, but with two substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a dibenzalacetone or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents.

Wait, considering the NMR: the triplet at 9.72 is probably an aldehyde proton. Let's say that's one group. Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets suggest two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. So perhaps two aromatic rings attached with substituents, each in such a way that the aromatic protons couple with each other.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see what possible structures that could be.

If the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with some substituents.

Wait, another thought: the presence of an aldehyde group (from the H at 9.72) and some substituents. Let's suppose the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with a substituent, maybe a phenyl group attached via a chain.

Wait, let's consider the NMR data again: the triplet at 9.72 (1H) is probably an aldehyde, but why a triplet? Maybe the aldehyde proton is next to a CH2 group which is split into a triplet. Wait, but aldehyde is RCHO, so the R would be connected to the aldehyde. So if the R is CH2-something, then the aldehyde H would be next to a CH2, which has two adjacent protons. So that would cause the aldehyde H to split into a triplet. Oh, that makes sense.

So structure like Ph-CH2-CHO. But wait, that would be Ph-CH2-CHO, which would have
