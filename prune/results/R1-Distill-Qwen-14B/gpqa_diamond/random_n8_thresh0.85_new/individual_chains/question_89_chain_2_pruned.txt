Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. From what I remember, when a dihalide reacts with a strong base like KOH, it's usually an elimination reaction, maybe an E2 mechanism. Since it's dibromine on adamantane, heating would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene.

The product after KOH is a light yellow solid, product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I think is a carbonyl group. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is being treated with KOH. Oh wait, maybe it's not elimination but substitution? No, because substitution would give a diol, but IR for an alcohol would have a broad O-H stretch, which is around 3300 cm-1. This IR is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but how do you get a carbonyl group from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Oh, wait! Maybe it's a double elimination, but not forming a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's an intramolecular elimination. Let me think. If you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, and KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a double bond. But that would give an alkene. But in that case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a more complex reaction. Oh! Maybe it's a neighboring group elimination. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not getting it right.

Wait, another possibility: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a dehydrohalogenation twice, but in a way that creates a ketone. Wait, how? Oh! Maybe it's a Baeyer-Villiger type elimination, but that usually involves ketones, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydroxide acting as a base, abstracting a proton leading to a bromide leaving, and then another elimination. Wait, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation to form a cyclohexene ring, but that might not give a ketone.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So, the 4.79 ppm peak is a doublet of two hydrogens. That's a region where alcohols, ethers, or possibly an ester or ketone's neighboring protons might show up. Wait, but if the IR is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or ketone.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH—maybe it's a substitution followed by elimination? Let me think. In substitution, two OH groups would be added, but that's a diol. But the IR doesn't match a diol. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but then another reaction. No, because KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but the IR would then show an epoxide's C-O-C, which is around 1200-1300 cm-1, but the main peak here is at 1720, so that's more likely a carbonyl.

Another thought: maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the two bromides are replaced by oxygen with negative charges, but then perhaps the structure forms an oxide ring, like forming a ketone. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is a bicyclic structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. If KOH is used, perhaps it abstracts a hydrogen, leading to a double bond, but where?

Wait, let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together in a particular way. The positions 1 and 3—so perhaps on adjacent carbons in the structure. So, when KOH is added, elimination occurs. Each elimination would produce HBr. Wait, if two eliminations occur, perhaps forming a double bond between C1 and C3 of the adamantane. But that would make the structure have a double bond, leading to a diene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the two eliminations lead to a conjugated diene.

But then, why is there a carbonyl in the IR? Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Suppose each Br is replaced
