Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, which I think is standard, so I might not need to adjust for temperature effects. Also, the Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 respectively.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that phosphate buffer solutions usually involve different phosphate species. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- when it dissociates, right? And Na2HPO4 is Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-. So in the solution, what's the situation here? Are we going to have PO4^3- in significant amounts? Because I remember that phosphate exists in different forms depending on pH.

So, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It loses protons in steps:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

Since the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively, I think this is a buffer solution. But wait, but the question is about PO4^3- concentration. So, perhaps I need to consider the hydrolysis of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- to form PO4^3-.

Wait, but in a buffer solution, the pH is determined by the pKa's. Let me think about the relevant pKa values. Ka1 is 7.5e-3, so pKa1 is about log(1/(7.5e-3)) → around 2.12. Then Ka2 is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 is about 7.21. Ka3 is 1.8e-12 → pKa3 around 11.74.

So the pH of the solution is probably somewhere near pKa2 because the buffer is made by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the pH will be around 7.2, which is near neutral.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-. So to get PO4^3-, HPO4^2- must lose a proton. But in solution, at pH around 7, which is lower than pKa3 (11.74), HPO4^2- won't deprotonate much. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low. That makes sense, but how do I calculate it?

Alternatively, maybe the solution is that the orthophosphate comes from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- through their respective deprotonation steps. But wait, I think H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

So in the solution, the PO4^3- concentration is the sum of the contributions from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- deprotonating. But given the pH is around 7, which is higher than pKa1 but lower than pKa2, no, wait: pKa2 is around 7.21, so the pH is near that. So, I'm a bit confused about how much each contributes.

Wait, let's think about it. At pH around 7.2, H2PO4^- can deprotonate to HPO4^2- and the reverse. Similarly, HPO4^2- can deprotonate to PO4^3- but that's only significant at higher pH, like above pKa3. So at pH 7, which is below pKa3, PO4^3- would be very, very low.

Wait, but wait, maybe the PO4^3- comes from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- losing protons. But wait, no, that's not right. H2PO4^- loses a proton to become HPO4^2-; HPO4^2- loses another to become PO4^3-.

So in the solution, which has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, each can contribute to PO4^3-. But because the pH is low relative to pKa3, the conversion from HPO4^2- to PO4^3- is minimal. Similarly, H2PO4^- can only convert to HPO4^2- when pH is above pKa2, but PO4^3- would only come from HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the only significant source of PO4^3- is the deprotonation of HPO4^2-. So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be determined by the concentration of HPO4^2- and the Ka3 value.

Wait, but how much HPO4^2- is in solution? Let's think about the solution composition. The solution has 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's calculate the moles of each.

Molar masses: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 moles.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005605 moles. Wait, because Na2HPO4·2H2O is the formula, which is the same as Na2HPO4 with two waters attached. So when dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 are about 0.00734 mol. The moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O are about 0.005605 mol. So total volume is 0.2 L.

So concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005605 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028025 M.

Wait, but in solution, these two can interconvert based on the pH. The pH is determined by the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-], right?

Because in a buffer solution, pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So wait, the relevant pKa is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8 → pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) ≈ 7.21.

So, pH = 7.21 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, the initial concentrations are [H2PO4^-] = 0.0367 M, [HPO4^2-] = 0.028025 M.

So let's compute the ratio.

Ratio = 0.028025 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.763.

So pH = 7.21 + log(0.763) → log(0.763) is about -0.117, so pH ≈ 7.21 -0.117 = 7.093.

So the solution's pH is approximately 7.09.

Now, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Since PO4^3- comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton, which is governed by Ka3.

The concentration of PO4^3- would be based on the concentration of HPO4^2- and the Ka3 value.

The reaction is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

But wait, in solution, [H+] is determined by the pH, which is about 7.09. So [H+] ≈ 10^(-7.09) ≈ 8.2e-8 M.

The expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can rearrange this to [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

[HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.028025 M.

[H+] is 8.2e-8 M.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.2e-8).

Let me compute that.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 ≈ 5.0445e-14.

Then, denominator: 8.2e-8.

So [PO4^3-] ≈ 5.0445e-14 / 8.2e-8.

Calculating 5.0445e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.0445 / 8.2) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.615 * 1e-6 → 6.15e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, that's around 6.15e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me compute the ratio correctly.

Wait, 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = (1.8 * 0.028025) * 1e-12.

1.8 * 0.028025 is about 0.050445.

So 0.050445e-12 → 5.0445e-14.

Divide by [H+] = 8.2e-8.

So 5.0445e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.0445 /8.2) ) * 1e-6.

Compute 5.0445 /8.2: 5.0445 ÷8.2.

Let me compute 5 ÷8.2 ≈ 0.6098.

0.0445 ÷8.2 ≈ 0.0054268.

So total is about 0.6152.

Multiply by 1e-6 → 6.152e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.15e-7 M. So the closest option is A:6.24e-7.

Wait, but wait a moment. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Because 5.0445e-14 divided by 8.2e-8 → (5.0445/8.2) * 1e-6.

Wait, 5.0445 /8.2 is approximately 0.615.

So it's 0.615e-6 = 6.15e-7.

But option A is 6.24e-7, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check my steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial moles.

Wait, the moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

Let me compute that more accurately.

1.00 /136.09 = approx 0.007342 moles.

Similarly, Na2HPO4.2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005605 moles.

So that part is correct.

Concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007342 /0.2 = 0.03671 M.

HPO4^2- is 0.005605 /0.2 = 0.028025 M.

So for the pH calculation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) inverse, wait wait no: pKa = -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

Ratio = [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028025 / 0.03671 ≈ 0.763.

log(0.763) ≈ -0.116.

So pH = 7.207 -0.116 = 7.091.

So [H+] = 1e-7.091 ≈ 8.2e-8.

So that's correct.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] → (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.2e-8).

Let me compute the numerator more accurately: 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 = 5.0445e-14.

Divide by 8.2e-8: 5.0445e-14 / 8.2e-8 = (5.0445 /8.2) * 1e-6.

5.0445 ÷8.2: Let me compute this more precisely.

8.2 × 0.615 is 5.043, because 8 ×0.615=4.92, 0.2×0.615=0.123, 4.92+0.123=5.043.

So 5.0445 ÷8.2 ≈ 0.6152.

So 0.6152e-6 → 6.152e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in another part. Let me think. Maybe I should calculate the exact pH.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives pH=pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

But the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So [base] = 0.028025 M, [acid] =0.03671 M.

The ratio is 0.028025 /0.03671 = let me compute this accurately.

0.028025 ÷0.03671 = 0.763.

Log(0.763) is about -0.116.

So pH=7.207 -0.116= 7.091.

[H+] = 10^(-7.091)= approx 8.19e-8.

Wait, earlier I approximated [H+] as 8.2e-8, which is correct.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) /8.19e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028025 =5.0445e-14.

Denominator:8.19e-8.

So 5.0445e-14 /8.19e-8 = (5.0445 /8.19 ) * 1e-6.

5.0445 ÷8.19 is about 0.616.

So [PO4^3-] =0.616e-6 → 6.16e-7 M.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match this. The options are:

A)6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C)2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

Wait, my calculation is about 6.16e-7, but option A is 6.24e-7. Close, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- isn't 0.028025 M. Wait, wait. Na2HPO4·2H2O: when dissolved, each molecule contributes one HPO4^2- ion, correct? So 1 mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So the moles from Na2HPO4·2H2O are 1.00g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005605 mol. So that's correct.

Wait, but when you add KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Now, perhaps the solution is a buffer, so the pH is 7.09, and the PO4^3- comes from the HPO4^2-.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of PO4^3- can be found using the expression from the third dissociation, which is:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

So that's what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the pH calculation.

Let me compute the exact pH using more precise numbers.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007342 / 0.2 = 0.03671 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005605 / 0.2 = 0.028025 M.

So the ratio is 0.028025 /0.03671 ≈ 0.763.

The log(0.763) = approximately -0.1159.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.1159 =7.0911.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.0911) = 8.18e-8.

Then, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028025) / (8.18e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 *0.028025 =5.0445e-14.

Denominator:8.18e-8.

So 5.0445e-14 /8.18e-8 = (5.0445 /8.18 ) * 1e-6.

Compute 5.0445 /8.18.

8.18 ×0.616 =5.045.

So 5.0445 ÷8.18=0.616.

So 0.616e-6 → 6.16e-7 M.

Hmm, the options don't have 6.16e-7, but option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

Wait, could there be an error in the way I accounted for the HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- concentrations? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the solution is a buffer, and the actual concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are different from their initial amounts due to the buffer equilibrium.

Because when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the system will adjust to the pH determined by their ratio.

Wait, but I already used that ratio to find the pH. So perhaps I'm correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the PO4^3- comes from both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- deprotonating. But no, H2PO4^- deprotonates to form HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- deprotonates to form PO4^3-.

So the PO4^3- comes only from HPO4^2-.

Wait, but another point: when H2PO4^- is present, can it lose two protons to become PO4^3-? Well, the first deprotonation is to become HPO4^2-, and the second deprotonation is from HPO4^2- to PO4^3-.

So in solution, the only source of PO4^3- is the deprotonation of HPO4^2-, which is governed by Ka3.

So I think my calculation is correct, and the answer should be approximately 6.16e-7 M, but the closest option is A)6.24e-7.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, let me recompute the moles.

For KH2PO4:

1.00g /136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.09.

1.00 /136.09 ≈ 0.007342 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O:

1.00g /177.99 g/mol = 0.005605 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

So concentrations are 0.03671 M H2PO4^- and 0.028025 M HPO4^2-.

Another approach: perhaps I should calculate the exact [PO4^3-] without assuming the pH.

Wait, but the pH is determined by the buffer. So perhaps I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact concentration using the dissociation constants.

Wait, another thought: The total phosphate concentration is the sum of H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

But H3PO4 is not present because the pH is around 7, which is higher than pKa1, so H3PO4 would be negligible.

So, the total phosphate comes from H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

Wait, but the sum of these species should equal the total phosphate from the initial moles.

Wait, the initial moles:

H2PO4^-: 0.007342 mol.

HPO4^2-:0.005605 mol.

Total phosphate is 0.007342 +0.005605 =0.012947 mol.

But after considering the dissociation, some H2PO4^- will convert to HPO4^2-, and some HPO4^2- will convert to PO4^3-.

Wait, but this complicates things. Because the buffer equation already takes into account the interconversion between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but PO4^3- is a small amount.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the charge balance equation to find the concentrations.

The solution is neutral (since the problem doesn't mention any strong acid or base), so the sum of cations equals the sum of anions.

The cations are K+ from KH2PO4 and Na+ from Na2HPO4.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole K+ and 1 mole H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and 1 HPO4^2-.

So moles of K+ = 0.007342 mol.

Moles of Na+ = 2 *0.005605 = 0.01121 mol.

Total cations: 0.007342 +0.01121 = 0.018552 mol.

Anions: H2PO4^- (0.007342 mol), HPO4^2- (0.005605 mol), PO4^3- (x), and OH^- (negligible at pH 7.09, but not sure).

Wait, but the charge balance should be:

Σ cations = Σ anions.

So, [K+] + 2*[Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] + 3*[PO4^3-] + [OH^-].

Wait, but OH^- is negligible at pH 7.09, so we can ignore it.

So, [K+] is 0.007342 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03671 M.

[Na+] is 0.01121 mol /0.2 L = 0.05605 M.

So, cation concentration: 0.03671 + (2 *0.05605) = 0.03671 +0.1121 = 0.14881 M.

Anion concentration: [H2PO4^-] + 2*[HPO4^2-] +3*[PO4^3-] = 0.14881 M.

Now, the buffer equation has already given us that the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] ≈0.763, leading to [HPO4^2-] =0.763 [H2PO4^-].

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] as a. Then [HPO4^2-] = 0.763 a.

So the anion equation becomes:

a + 2*(0.763 a) +3x =0.14881.

Wait, but a is [H2PO4^-], which from the buffer is a =0.03671 M initially, but perhaps it's adjusted due to the buffer.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the system.

We have a buffer solution where the majority of the phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The concentration of PO4^3- is x, which we can find.

From the buffer calculation, we have [HPO4^2-] =0.763 [H2PO4^-].

Wait, but from the initial moles, [H2PO4^-] is 0.03671 M, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028025 M. But the buffer adjusts these concentrations based on pH.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should proceed with the charge balance equation.

Charge balance:

[K+] + 2[Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

We can express [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] in terms of a, and [PO4^3-] as x.

But considering that the buffer equation relates [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-], which are a and b.

Wait, perhaps using the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^((pH - pKa2)).

We know pH is 7.09, pKa2 is 7.207.

So [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(7.09 -7.207) = [H2PO4^-] * 10^(-0.117) ≈ [H2PO4^-] * 0.763.

So [HPO4^2-] ≈0.763 [H2PO4^-].

Let me denote [H2PO4^-] =a, so [HPO4^2-] =0.763 a.

Now, the charge balance equation becomes:

[K+] + 2[Na+] = a + 2*(0.763 a) +3x.

But [K+] is 0.03671 M, [Na+] is 0.05605 M → sum is 0.03671 + 2*(0.05605)=0.03671+0.1121=0.14881 M.

So:

0.14881 = a + 1.526 a +3x → 0.14881 =2.526 a +3x.

But from the buffer, the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.763, which comes from the pH and pKa2.

But total phosphate from the initial solution is 0.007342 +0.005605 =0.012947 mol.

Total phosphate in solution is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] = a +0.763 a +x = 1.763 a +x.

But this must equal the total moles of phosphate, which is 0.012947 mol → 0.012947 /0.2 L = 0.064735 M.

So:

1.763 a +x =0.064735.

Now, from charge balance:

0.14881 =2.526 a +3x.

We have two equations:

1) 1.763 a +x =0.064735.

2) 2.526 a +3x =0.14881.

We can solve this system.

From equation 1: x=0.064735 -1.763 a.

Substitute into equation 2:

2.526 a +3*(0.064735 -1.763 a) =0.14881.

Compute:

2.526 a + 0.194205 -5.289 a =0.14881.

Combine like terms:

(2.526 a -5.289 a) +0.194205 =0.14881.

-2.763 a +0.194205 =0.14881.

-2.763 a =0.14881 -0.194205 → -2.763 a = -0.045395.

a = (-0.045395)/(-2.763) ≈0.016436 M.

So [H2PO4^-] =0.016436 M.

Then x=0.064735 -1.763 *0.016436 → 1.763 *0.016436 ≈0.0289.

So x≈0.064735 -0.0289 ≈0.035835 M.

Wait, that's [PO4^3-] =0.035835 M, which is way higher than our earlier calculation. But that can't be right because at pH 7.09, PO4^3- should be very low.

This suggests a contradiction. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, wait, this can't be correct because 0.0358 M PO4^3- would imply a very high pH, but our pH was 7.09.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the charge balance equation.

Wait, the charge balance equation should be:

sum of cation concentrations = sum of anion concentrations.

Cations:

[K+] =0.03671 M.

[Na+] =0.05605 M.

Total cations: 0.03671 +0.05605 =0.09276 M.

Wait, wait a second! I think I made a mistake earlier. No, wait: Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ per formula unit, so moles of Na+ are 2 *0.005605 =0.01121 mol. So [Na+] is 0.01121 /0.2 =0.05605 M.

[K+] is 0.007342 /0.2=0.03671 M.

So total cations: 0.03671 +0.05605 =0.09276 M.

Anions: [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] +3[PO4^3-] + [OH^-] ≈ [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] +3[PO4^3-].

So the charge balance equation is:

0.09276 = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] +3[PO4^3-].

So, that's equation (2):

[H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] +3[PO4^3-] =0.09276.

Equation (1): [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] + [PO4^3-] =0.064735.

Hmm, this makes more sense. Because the phosphate species sum to 0.064735 M, and the charge balance is 0.09276 M on the cation side.

Let me rewrite the equations.

Let me define [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b, [PO4^3-] =c.

So,

Equation 1: a + b + c = 0.064735.

Equation 2: a + 2b +3c =0.09276.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(a + 2b +3c) - (a + b + c) )=0.09276 -0.064735 → b +2c =0.028025.

So, equation 3: b +2c =0.028025.

Now, from the buffer equation, we have:

pH = pKa2 + log(b/a).

We found pH=7.09, pKa2=7.207.

So,

7.09 =7.207 + log(b/a) → log(b/a)=7.09-7.207= -0.117 → b/a=10^(-0.117)=0.763.

So, b=0.763 a.

Now, substituting into equation 3:

0.763 a +2c =0.028025.

And from equation 1: a +0.763 a +c=0.064735 → 1.763 a +c=0.064735 → c=0.064735 -1.763 a.

Substituting into equation 3:

0.763 a +2*(0.064735 -1.763 a) =0.028025.

Let me compute:

0.763 a + 0.12947 -3.526 a =0.028025.

Combine like terms:

(0.763 -3.526) a +0.12947 =0.028025 → (-2.763 a) +0.12947=0.028025.

→-2.763 a =0.028025 -0.12947 →-2.763 a =-0.099445 → a= (-0.099445)/(-2.763) ≈0.03592 M.

So [H2PO4^-] =a=0.03592 M.

Then, b=0.763 *0.03592≈0.02746 M.

Now, c=0.064735 -1.763 *0.03592 →1.763 *0.03592≈0.06338 → c=0.064735 -0.06338≈0.001355 M.

So [PO4^3-] =0.001355 M =1.355e-3 M. Wait, that's 1.355e-3 M, which is way higher than our previous calculation of 6e-7 M.

But that can't be right because at pH 7, PO4^3- should be minuscule. So where's the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the charge balance equation.

Wait, the anions are [H2PO4^-], [HPO4^2-], and [PO4^3-].

But each HPO4^2- contributes 2- charge, so in the charge balance, each contributes 2 times their concentration. Similarly, PO4^3- contributes 3 times their concentration.

So, the charge balance equation should be:

[K+] + 2[Na+] = [H2PO4^-] + 2[HPO4^2-] + 3[PO4^3-].

Which is:

0.03671 + 2*0.05605 = a + 2b +3c.

Wait, 2*0.05605 is 0.1121. So,

0.03671 + 0.1121 = a +2b +3c → 0.14881 = a +2b +3c.

Which matches equation 2.

But from equation 1, a + b + c =0.064735.

Then, subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (a+2b +3c) - (a +b +c) )= (0.14881 -0.064735) → b +2c =0.084075.

Wait wait, earlier I had 0.028025, which is incorrect. Where did I get 0.028025 from?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculation earlier. Let me recompute equation 3.

Equation 2: a + 2b +3c =0.14881.

Equation 1: a +b +c =0.064735.

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

( a + 2b +3c ) - (a +b +c ) ) = 0.14881 -0.064735 → b + 2c =0.084075.

So that's equation 3: b + 2c =0.084075.

Earlier, I had b +2c =0.028025, which was wrong. So that's where I made a mistake.

Now, with equation 3: b +2c =0.084075.

And from buffer equation: b=0.763 a.

Equation 1: a +0.763 a +c =0.064735 → 1.763 a +c=0.064735 → c=0.064735 -1.763 a.

Substituting into equation 3:

0.763 a + 2*(0.064735 -1.763 a )=0.084075.

Compute:

0.763a + 0.12947 -3.526a =0.084075.

Combine terms:

(0.763 -3.526) a +0.12947 =0.084075 → (-2.763 a) +0.12947=0.084075.

→-2.763 a =0.084075 -0.12947 →-2.763 a =-0.045395 → a= (-0.045395)/(-2.763)=0.016436 M.

So [H2PO4^-] =a=0.016436 M.

Then, b=0.763 *0.016436≈0.01253 M.

And c=0.064735 -1.763 *0.016436 →1.763 *0.016436≈0.0289.

So c=0.064735 -0.0289=0.035835 M.

Wait, that can't be right because [PO4^3-] is 0.0358 M, which is way too high for pH 7. So something is wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is flawed. Maybe considering the charge balance is complicating things, and I should stick with the initial approach using Ka3.

So, perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation where [PO4^3-] is about 6.16e-7 M, and the closest option is A)6.24e-7.

But then why does the charge balance approach give a different result? Because perhaps the initial assumption that the buffer solution determines the pH is correct, and the charge balance approach is leading to a contradiction because it's introducing additional variables that complicate the solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the charge balance approach was leading to an error because the dissociation of water and other factors are being considered, but in reality, the PO4^3- concentration is negligible compared to the other species.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A)6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the buffer system created by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains 1.00 g of each compound, and the relevant dissociation constants for H₃PO₄ are provided:  
- **Ka₁ = 7.5 × 10⁻³**, **Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸**, **Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²**.  

### Step 1: Calculate moles of phosphate species
1. **KH₂PO₄ (H₂PO₄⁻):**  
   Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol.  
   Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Concentration = \( \frac{0.00734}{0.2} = 0.0367 \, \text{M} \).  

2. **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (HPO₄²⁻):**  
   Molar mass = 177.99 g/mol.  
   Moles = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005605 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Concentration = \( \frac{0.005605}{0.2} = 0.028025 \, \text{M} \).  

### Step 2: Determine the pH of the buffer
The buffer consists of H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the relevant equilibrium governed by **Ka₂**.  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]  
Substitute the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.028025}{0.0367}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.763) \approx 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.09
\]  

### Step 3: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The concentration of PO₄³⁻ arises from the deprotonation of HPO₄²⁻:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{PO₄³⁻} + \text{H⁺}
\]  
The equilibrium constant is **Ka₃ = 1.8 × 10⁻¹²**. Using the expression for Ka₃:  
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{PO₄³⁻}][\text{H⁺}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]  
Rearranging for [PO₄³⁻]:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.09} \approx 8.2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028025)}{8.2 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0445 \times 10^{-14}}{8.2 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]  

### Step 4: Compare with options
The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately \( 6.16 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to **Option A: \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
