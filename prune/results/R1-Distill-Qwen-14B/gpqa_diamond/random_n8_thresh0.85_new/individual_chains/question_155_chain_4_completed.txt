Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. 

Alright, first, let me try to understand the setup. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 3x3 matrices. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means we're working in the eigenbasis of P_z.

Wait, so the state is given in the P_z basis? Or is it in some other basis? Oh, the problem says the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That's important because when the state is in the eigenbasis of an operator, measuring that operator's value is straightforward.

The question is about the uncertainty in P_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then compute that.

First, let's write down the state vector. It's a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

Since P_z is diagonal in this basis (because the basis vectors are its eigenvectors), calculating ⟨P_z⟩ should be straightforward. Wait, looking at P_z's matrix, its diagonal elements are [ħ, 0, -ħ]. So the diagonal entries correspond to the eigenvalues. So each basis vector |i⟩ is an eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue p_zi.

So, since the state is in the P_z basis, each component of |ψ⟩ corresponds to the amplitude in that eigenstate. Therefore, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Let's compute that. The components of the state are (-1/2), (1/√2), (-1/2). Wait, but wait—amplitudes must satisfy normalization. Let me check if the state is normalized.

Compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values: (1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (1/2)^2. That's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. Oh, wait no: 1/2 would be 0.5, but 1/4 + 1/4 is 0.5, adding 0.5 (from (1/√2)^2=1/2) gives 1. So yes, it's normalized. Great.

Now, each component corresponds to the eigenvalue of P_z. The first component is -1/2, so the probability is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, and the eigenvalue is ħ. Because the first diagonal element of P_z is ħ. Wait, looking back at P_z's matrix: first row is [ħ, 0, 0], second is [0,0,0], third is [0,0,-ħ]. So the three eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the three basis states |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ correspond to eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Compute each term:

First term: | -1/2 |^2 * ħ = (1/4) * ħ.

Second term: | 1/√2 |^2 * 0 = 0.

Third term: | -1/2 |^2 * (-ħ) = (1/4) * (-ħ).

So adding them up: (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just the square of each diagonal element, so the matrix would have (ħ², 0, ħ²) on the diagonal.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2.

Compute each term:

First term: (1/4) * (ħ)^2 = (1/4) ħ².

Second term: (1/2) * (0)^2 = 0.

Third term: (1/4) * ( (-ħ)^2 ) = (1/4) ħ².

Adding them up: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Then, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

1. State is normalized: yes.

2. Compute ⟨P_z⟩: correct.

3. Compute ⟨P_z²⟩: correct.

4. Uncertainty: yes, sqrt(1/2 ħ²) is ħ*sqrt(1/2) = ħ/(sqrt(2)). So answer is B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot p_{z,i},
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ is the probability of the $i$-th eigenstate, and $p_{z,i}$ is the corresponding eigenvalue. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The eigenvalues are $p_{z,1} = \hbar$, $p_{z,2} = 0$, and $p_{z,3} = -\hbar$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is diagonal in the same basis as $P_z$, with diagonal entries equal to the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Thus, the eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are:

\[
p_{z,1}^2 = \hbar^2, \quad p_{z,2}^2 = 0, \quad p_{z,3}^2 = \hbar^2.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot p_{z,i}^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities and eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$ and $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
