Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electron scattering, and I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question gives me some phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. They tell me to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, with some numbers in fm.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, especially in electron scattering, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using partial waves. The formula I think is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ)

Where k is the wave number, l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, δ_l the phase shifts, and P_l the Legendre polynomials. But wait, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. That would be when θ=0°, right? Because the incident beam is moving along, say, the z-axis, so scattering at 0° is along the same direction.

Wait, but when θ=0°, cosθ =1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials P_l(1) equals 1. So the scattering amplitude simplifies for θ=0°.

So f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l * 1

Which I can write as (1/k) Σ (2l +1) [e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ]

But e^{iδ} sinδ = sinδ e^{iδ} = (e^{iδ} - e^{-iδ})/(2i) * 2i sinδ? Wait, maybe a better approach is to express e^{iδ} sinδ as (e^{iδ} - e^{-iδ})/(2i) multiplied by 2i sinδ? Wait, wait, no, let me think. The general formula for e^{iθ} sinθ is:

e^{iθ} sinθ = sinθ (cosθ + i sinθ) = [e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}]/(2i) * sinθ

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of breaking e^{iδ} sinδ into real and imaginary parts. Oh wait, the question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im(f(0)).

So let's compute each term's contribution to the imaginary part. For each l, the term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. Let me write e^{iδ} as cosδ + i sinδ. So each term becomes:

(2l+1) [cosδ_l + i sinδ_l] * sinδ_l

= (2l+1) [ cosδ_l sinδ_l + i (sinδ_l)^2 ]

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) (sinδ_l)^2.

But wait, wait. Let me re-calculate:

Each term is (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l = (2l+1) [ cosδ_l + i sinδ_l ] * sinδ_l = (2l+1) [ cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin²δ_l ]

So the real part is (2l+1) cosδ_l sinδ_l, and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

So the total imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over all l of (2l+1) sin²δ_l, multiplied by (1/k).

But wait, the formula for f(θ) is (1/k) times the sum. So f(0) would be (1/k) sum [ (2
