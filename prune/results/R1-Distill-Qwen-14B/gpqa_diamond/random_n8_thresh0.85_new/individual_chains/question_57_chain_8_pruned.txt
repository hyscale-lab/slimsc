Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that phase shifts are involved in scattering amplitudes. The question gives me several phase shifts: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Wait, but the rest are ignored. I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, the incident beam direction—so that's the forward direction, like when the angle θ is 0 degrees. Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) can be expressed in terms of phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin( (2l+1)θ ) ), summed over l from 0 to some maximum. But wait, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0°. 

Wait, let me think. When θ is 0, sin(nθ) becomes sin(0), which is zero for any integer n. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Or perhaps I should consider the full expression and see what happens when θ=0.

Alternatively, I remember that the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam (θ=0) is given by f(0) = (1/(2ik)) ( e^{iδ_0} - 1 ). Because for θ=0, the sum reduces to considering each term (2l+1)θ=0, so sin(0) would be zero except when l=0. Wait, no, because when θ=0, each term is sin( (2l+1)*0 ), which is zero. But I must be missing something because if all terms are zero, then f(0) would be zero, but that doesn't make sense because the options are non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the general expression is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} [sin( (l + 1/2) θ ) / sin(θ/2) ] ) )? No, that's the expansion for the partial waves, but I might be getting confused here.

Wait, another approach. The scattering amplitude for each partial wave is given by f_l(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin( (2l+1)θ/2 ) ) ), or something like that. Wait, no, maybe I should think about the total amplitude as a sum over all l, each contributing (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} times a function of θ. 

But for the forward direction, θ=0, so let's see. For each l, the term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin( (2l+1) * 0 ). But sin(0) is zero for all l, so each term would be zero. But that can't be right, because some of the phase shifts are given and we're supposed to compute the
