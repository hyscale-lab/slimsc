Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about stellar abundances, and I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, the question gives me some data about two stars and the Sun. I remember that [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of element X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, [X/Y] is log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So if it's positive, X is more abundant than Y in that star compared to the Sun.

The problem states:
- Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
- Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
- Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, same as the Sun. So Fe in Star_1 is same as Sun.
- Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, so Mg in Star_2 is same as Sun.

Wait, but H is hydrogen, so [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) compared to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So for the Sun, [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun = 0, which makes sense because it's the reference.

Now, let's start with Star_1. 

Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so n
