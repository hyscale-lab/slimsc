Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm... the question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions, right? So metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds, and typically, it leads to the redistribution of alkyl groups between the alkenes.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is racemic. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But in the case of 3-methylpent-1-ene, does it have a stereocenter? Let me think. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but how many methyl groups are attached to the double bond?

Wait, no, wait again. 1-pentene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl-1-pentene would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, but wait, that can't be right. Let me count the carbons. 1: CH2=, 2: CH-, 3: CH(CH3)-, 4: CH2-, 5: CH3. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, but wait again. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C3 are a methyl group and two CH2 groups. Does that create any stereogenic centers? No, because the structure is symmetric. Let me check: C3 is attached to CH(CH3), so wait, no, wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me think again. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the pentene has five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C3 are a methyl group and two CH2 groups. Wait, so C3 is connected to C2 (which is CH2 from the double bond) and another CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, the molecule is: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Let me count again. Pentene has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I mixed up the numbering.

Wait, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So adding a methyl group on C3 would give CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait that's five carbons. Because, CH2=CH is C1 and C2, then C3 is CH(CH3), C4 is CH2, C5 is CH3? No, wait, that's five carbons? CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 would be six carbons. Oh wait, no. I'm getting confused here. Let me write it step by step.

Numbering from the double bond (position 1 and 2):

1: CH2= 
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH2
5: CH3

Wait, that's five carbons. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. No, wait, that would have six carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this properly. Let me think again. Pentene is five carbons with a double bond. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is (CH2)2C=CHCH2CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So if we have a methyl group on C3, that would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But wait, that's six carbons, right? So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would have five carbons in the main chain, with a methyl branch on C3. Wait, but the main chain would be five carbons, so that can't be. Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the nomenclature. Perhaps it's (CH2)2C=CHCH2CH3? No, that's 3-methylhex-1-ene.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. The formula would be C6H10. Because pentene is C5H10, and adding a methyl group adds another carbon, making it C6H10.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that would be longer. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's move on for a moment. The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the molecule has a double bond and is chiral. Wait, but is it chiral? Because if the double bond is in a position where the substituents are not the same on either side, it might have geometric isomerism, but in this case, the question is about a racemic mixture. But wait, wait. How can the starting material be racemic? Because a racemic mixture refers to a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But that's only possible if the molecule has a chiral center. But if the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene, is there a chiral center?

Wait, in 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. So maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Let me try again. Perhaps it's 3-methylpent-1-ene as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that would be five carbons in the main chain? Wait, maybe the main chain is four carbons. So if it's pent-1-ene, the main chain is five carbons, double bond at position 1. Then the substituents: a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be five carbons in the main chain (positions 1-5), with a methyl on C3. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But that makes the molecule symmetrical. Because the substituents on C2 and C3 would be: C2 is CH2=CH and CH(CH3), while C3 is CH(CH3) and CH2CH3. Wait, but is there a plane of symmetry here?

Wait, looking at the structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So from the double bond, C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, connected to C3 which is CH(CH3), which is connected to CH2CH3. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but in that case, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me see: if I mirror it, would it look the same? Let's imagine the central part is C3. The groups attached to C3 are CH2=CH- (from C2), a CH3, and a CH2CH3. So, if I mirror the molecule, would the groups be the same? No, because on one side, the substituent is a CH2=CH- group, and on the other, a CH2CH3. So maybe the molecule is chiral, hence the racemate.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a double bond, can it have a chiral center? Because to have a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents. Let's look at C3. The substituents are:

- CH2=CH- group (from C2)
- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2CH3 (ethyl)
- And the fourth substituent would be the rest of the molecule, which is CH2CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So C3 is connected to:

- C2: which is CH2=CH-
- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2CH3 (ethyl), which is connected to C4 and C5.

Wait, but wait. C3 is CH(CH3). So the substituents are:

- CH2=CH- group (from C2)
- CH3 (methyl)
- Two CH2 groups? No, because C3 is attached to two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me clarify the structure again. Okay, perhaps I'm getting stuck here, so let's move forward.

The problem states that the starting material is racemic. So it's a 50-50 mix of two enantiomers. So the molecule must have a chiral center. So, which carbon is the chiral center?

Looking at the molecule again: in 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then C3 is CH(CH3), and attached to C4 (CH2) and C5 (CH3). Wait, so C3 has the substituents:

- Two CH2 groups (one from C2 and one from C4?), but that's not correct because C2 is CH2=CH-. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me approach this differently. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is C6H10. Let's write the structure again.

Pent-1-ene has five carbons, with the double bond at position 1. So, CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons, so CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Adding a methyl group on C3 would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, that's six carbons. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the positions. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2C=CHCH2CH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, but that would make it 2-pentene, not 1-pentene. So I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the molecule as having a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C3.

Wait, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Let me check the substituents on C3. So C3 is connected to:

- C2: which is CH2=CH-
- CH3 (methyl)
- CH2CH3 (from C4)
- And the C4: which is CH2- connected to CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps C3 is connected to C2 (CH2=CH-), CH3, CH2CH3, and another CH2 group? That can't be, as that would be four substituents, but I'm not sure if they're all different.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 is bonded to:

- CH2=CH- (from C2)
- CH3
- CH2CH3 (from C4)
- Another CH2 group? Or perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, perhaps the right way is to think of the molecule as having a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl branch on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Now, looking at C3, the substituents are:

- CH2=CH- (from C2)
- CH3
- CH2CH3 (from C4)
- And another CH2 group? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should model the molecule as:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

So, the groups attached to C3 are: CH2=CH-, CH3, CH2CH3, and the other CH2- from C4. But wait, that would mean C3 has four different substituents: CH2=CH-, CH3, CH2CH3, and a CH2 group (since C3 is connected to C4 via a single bond, which is CH2CH3). Wait, but the CH2 group from C4 would actually be CH2-CH3, so the substituent is CH2CH3. Thus, the substituents on C3 are:

- CH2=CH- (group)
- CH3
- CH2CH3
- And the fourth substituent is another CH2 group? No, because C3 is connected to C4 via a single bond, which is CH2CH3. So the groups attached to C3 are:

1. CH2=CH- (from C2)
2. CH3 (methyl)
3. CH2CH3 (ethyl)
4. A CH2 group that's part of the main chain? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the fourth substituent is a hydrogen. Because wait, CH(CH3) would have a CH3, and the other groups. Wait, no, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, then C3 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are CH2=CH- (from C2), CH3 (methyl), CH2CH3 (from C4), and a hydrogen? No, because CH(CH3) would have three substituents: CH2=CH-, CH3, and the other two bonds. Wait, perhaps this is getting me confused. Maybe the molecule is actually not chiral, but I thought the question said it's racemic, implying it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps I need to accept that the molecule is chiral and proceed. So, when Grubbs catalyst is used, what happens? Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst used for olefin metathesis. It typically causes the breaking and reforming of double bonds, leading to the exchange of alkyl groups between the catalyst and the olefin.

In the case of ring-closing metathesis, it's used to form rings. But in this case, we're starting with an acyclic molecule. Wait, but maybe it's a cross-metathesis, but since there's only one alkene, perhaps it's a ring-closing.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has a structure that could undergo ring-closing metathesis. Let me think: the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So if metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bond and reorganize the ends.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would take one end (like the CH2 from C1) and another end (perhaps the CH2CH3 from C4) and form a new double bond, connecting them to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst would cause the molecule to form a ring by connecting the two ends. Let me think about the possible products.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

If metathesis occurs between the double bond and the CH2CH3 group, perhaps two new alkenes are formed, and a ring is formed.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the possible products. Grubbs catalyst would break the double bond and reorganize the ends. So in this case, the possible products could be a ring and some smaller alkenes, but the question states to exclude ethene, which is the smallest alkene (ethene is C2H4).

Wait, but perhaps the major product is a ring formation. Let me think: the molecule has five carbons (maybe I was wrong about the structure, but assuming that the main chain is five carbons, perhaps). But in any case, when 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes metathesis, it can form a ring. The possible rings that can form would depend on which ends are connected.

Wait, but wait. In the molecule, the ends are CH2 groups. Let me think, if the catalyst breaks the double bond and connects the CH2 from the left end (C1) with the CH2CH3 group on the right end (C5), perhaps forming a five-membered ring. Alternatively, maybe a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a bicyclic compound, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the catalyst would cause the formation of a new alkene, rearranging the substituents.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible outcomes of the metathesis. In olefin metathesis, the catalyst breaks the double bond and connects the ends in a way that exchanges the substituents.

In this case, the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the catalyst could break the double bond and allow the alkenyl groups to swap, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps the catalyst would cause the two ends of the double bond to swap partners, leading to different alkenes. So the CH2 group from C1 could combine with the CH2CH3 group from C5, and the CH- from C2 would combine with CH(CH3) from C3.

But I'm not very confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst would cause the formation of a new double bond in the molecule, leading to a ring structure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a ring by connecting the CH2 from the left (C1) to the CH(CH3) group on C3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in cross-metathesis, if there's another alkene present, but in this case, it's just the starting material, so it's a ring-closing metathesis.

Wait, in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst would connect two ends of the same molecule to form a ring, releasing ethylene as a byproduct.

So the starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Let's imagine that during metathesis, the catalyst would break the double bond and form new bonds between the CH2 group at C1 and the CH2CH3 group at C5, releasing ethylene.

If that happens, the product would be a four-membered ring? Because the chain is four carbons long between C1 and C5? Wait, no, the chain from C1 to C5 is longer. Let me count the carbons between the ends.

Wait, from C1 (CH2=) to C5 (CH3), the chain is C1, C2, C3, C4, C5. But that would be a five-carbon chain. So if the catalyst connects the ends, the ring formed would be a five-membered ring. Because the two ends are C1 and C5. So the ring would be five-membered.

So the product would be cyclopentane derivative. Let me think about the structure. The ring would be formed by connecting C1 and C5. So the new double bond would be between C2 and C3, perhaps, and between C4 and C5, depending on where the catalyst breaks.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopentene derivative. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to the formation of two different possible products, depending on where the catalyst breaks the bonds. But considering that the starting material is racemic, perhaps each enantiomer would produce a different product.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is racemic, meaning it's a 50-50 mix of two enantiomers. Each enantiomer would, upon metathesis, produce a different product. So the number of possible products would be based on the number of stereoisomers formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to more than one product. Let me think about possible products.

Wait, maybe the reaction produces a mix of different alkenes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a ring structure and some smaller alkenes, but the question says to exclude ethene, so ethene (ethene) is not counted.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible products of ring-closing metathesis of 3-methylpent-1-ene.

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. If the catalyst causes the CH2 from C1 to bond with the CH2CH3 from C5, releasing ethylene (which we exclude), the ring formed would connect C1 and C5.

Wait, but what's the structure of the ring? Let me count the atoms between C1 and C5: C1, C2, C3, C4, C5. So the chain is four bonds long, so the ring would have five members (since four single bonds would form a five-membered ring when connected).

Wait, but when the catalyst breaks the double bond, it would form two new double bonds. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the ring would have a double bond within it.

Wait, so the ring would be cyclopentene or a substituted cyclopentene.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is exo or endo depending on where the groups are placed. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a transposition of substituents, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cycloalkene with substituents. So, for example, cyclopentene with a methyl group.

But how many possible products would that give?

Wait, considering the starting material is racemic. Each enantiomer would produce a different product upon metathesis. So if the product has a chiral center, each enantiomer would form a different diastereomer, perhaps.

Wait, but let's think about the possible products. If the starting material is a racemic mixture, then each enantiomer (say, R and S configurations) would undergo the same metathesis reaction, but perhaps producing different products.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces the same product regardless of the starting enantiomer, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple products due to different possible ring sizes.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can form different rings depending on which ends are connected. For instance, connecting C1 to C4, C1 to C5, etc. But I'm not sure what's possible.

Wait, but with 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible rings formed could be either a four-membered ring (if the ends are C1 and C4) or a five-membered ring (C1 and C5). But four-membered rings are less favorable due to ring strain, so perhaps the five-membered ring is the major product.

So, the major product would be a five-membered ring, specifically cyclopentene with a substituent. Let me think about the substituents.

The original molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. When the ring forms by connecting C1 and C5, the structure would be a cyclopentene ring. Specifically, the ring would be formed with the double bond between C2 and C3, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the ring would have the double bond where the original double bond was, but that might not be possible because the original double bond is broken in the metathesis.

Hmm, perhaps the ring would have a new double bond. So, the product would be a substituted cyclopentene.

Wait, but I'm not exactly certain about the structure. Perhaps I should think about the possible products in terms of the number of different alkenes formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis doesn't form a ring but instead rearranges the substituents, leading to different alkenes.

Wait, another approach: when Grubbs catalyst is used on an alkene, it can cause different types of metathesis. If the starting alkene is symmetric, the product would be a single product. But if it's unsymmetric, it can lead to multiple products.

In this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C2 are a CH2 group and a CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group. So the molecule may be unsymmetric, leading to different products upon metathesis.

Wait, Grubbs catalyst typically induces olefin metathesis, which can be ring-closing or cross-metathesis. Since we're starting with a single compound, it's likely a ring-closing metathesis.

In ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst will connect two ends of the molecule, breaking the double bond and forming a new ring. The position where the connection occurs determines the size of the ring formed.

In 3-methylpent-1-ene, the possible ring sizes are four or five. Connecting C1 and C4 would form a four-membered ring, while connecting C1 and C5 would form a five-membered ring. Five-membered rings are more favorable, so perhaps that's the major product.

But wait, can the catalyst form a five-membered ring? Let me count the atoms between C1 and C5. The chain from C1 to C5 is:

C1 (CH2=) → C2 (CH-) → C3 (CH(CH3)) → C4 (CH2) → C5 (CH3)

So the chain is four bonds long (C1 to C5), so connecting them would form a five-membered ring (since a ring requires at least three atoms, but in this case, it's C1 to C5, which is five atoms, leading to a five-membered ring).

So, the product would be a cyclopentene ring with substituents.

Now, considering the substituents, how many possible products are there?

The starting material is a racemic mixture, which implies it has a chiral center. But when the ring forms, does the product have any chiral centers?

Suppose the product is a substituted cyclopentene. The substituents would depend on where the original groups are attached.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. The ring would be a five-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents would be a methyl group and an ethyl group (from CH2CH3) attached to the ring.

But when the ring forms, where do these substituents end up?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents' positions on the ring would vary based on the starting enantiomer, leading to different products.

Wait, but since the starting material is racemic, each enantiomer would form a different diastereomer in the product, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is not chiral, leading to only one product.

Wait, but let me think about the possible structures.

When the ring forms, the substituents (like the methyl group) could be in different positions relative to the ring's double bond.

For example, if the ring is cyclopentene with a substituent (like a methyl group) on one carbon and an ethyl group on another, the substituents' positions would determine the product.

But perhaps each enantiomer would form a different product, leading to two possible products.

But wait, the question is about possible products excluding ethene. So if the reaction forms ethene as a byproduct, which we exclude, we only count the other products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms multiple products, depending on the positions where the catalyst breaks the bonds.

Wait, another thought: Grubbs catalyst can cause different types of ring formation, such as forming rings of different sizes if possible. But in this case, perhaps the main product is a five-membered ring and another product from a different bond breaking.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the metathesis leads to a bicyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring-closing metathesis leads to a single product, but considering the starting material's stereochemistry, it could lead to two different products.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the number of products.

Assuming that the ring-closing metathesis leads to a single product, but because the starting material is racemic, the product could have two enantiomers, leading to two products. But if the product is achiral, then it would be a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a new chiral center, leading to two enantiomers, so two products.

But wait, I'm not certain about whether the product is chiral.

Let me think: the product is a substituted cyclopentene. Let's imagine the structure is cyclopentene with a methyl group and an ethyl group attached. If these substituents are on adjacent carbons, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, for example, if the substituents are on adjacent carbons in the ring, there could be a possibility of a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are across from each other, making the molecule symmetrical and hence achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the product is achiral, leading to a single product.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single product, so the number of possible products is one. But the options don't have that. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the possibility of multiple metathesis pathways.

Another possibility: the starting material could undergo different types of metathesis, such as ring-opening or cross-metathesis, but in this case, since it's a single compound, it's more likely ring-closing.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule can form more than one ring, depending on where the catalyst breaks the bonds.

Wait, for example, the molecule could form a four-membered ring by connecting C1 and C4, and a five-membered ring by connecting C1 and C5. But four-membered rings are less favorable, so perhaps the major product is the five-membered ring, but the question asks for possible products, so both might be possible, leading to two products.

But wait, the starting material is a racemic mixture. Each enantiomer would form a different product when forming a four-membered or five-membered ring. So, 4-membered would be two products, 5-membered would be two products, leading to four products in total. But I'm not sure if both ring sizes are possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the five-membered ring is the only product, leading to two possible products (each from the racemic enantiomers), but the product itself is a pair of enantiomers, so it's just one product.

Wait, but in terms of counting the number of products, each enantiomer would produce a product, but if the products are enantiomers, they're still considered the same product in terms of structure, but different in terms of stereochemistry.

But the question asks for the number of possible products, excluding ethene. So, perhaps the product is a single compound, but considering the starting material's stereochemistry, it could form two products.

Alternatively, if the product has a new chiral center, each enantiomer of the starting material would produce a different enantiomer of the product, leading to two possible products.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of three different products, but that doesn't fit any of the options.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible products when 3-methylpent-1-ene undergoes ring-closing metathesis with Grubbs catalyst.

The starting molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Upon metathesis, the catalyst could form a ring by connecting the CH2 from C1 with the CH2CH3 from C5, leading to a cyclopentene ring.

The product would be a cyclopentene with substituents.

The substituents would be the groups that were attached to C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the product is (3R)-methylcyclopentene and (3S)-methylcyclopentene, depending on the starting material's configuration.

But wait, the starting material is a racemic mixture, so each enantiomer would produce a different product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single product, but because the starting material is racemic, it forms a racemic mixture of the product.

But I'm still not sure.

Wait, perhaps the metathesis leads to a new alkene. Let me think: the starting material is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

If the catalyst causes a shift in the double bond, perhaps moving it from C1-C2 to a different position.

But in that case, the product would be an isomer of the starting material, but that seems unlikely if the metathesis is happening.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diene, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a ring but instead forms a new alkene in a different position, but that would be a different product.

Wait, but the problem states to exclude ethene. So, ethene isn't counted, but other alkenes are.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the possible alkenes that can form.

Wait, another possibility: the metathesis could break the double bond and form new alkenes by combining different ends.

In this case, perhaps the product would be a mixture of 1-methylcyclopentene and another isomer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms two different alkenes, each with different substituents, leading to two products.

But then, considering the starting material is racemic, each enantiomer would form a different product, leading to a total of four products.

But the options don't have four except option A)4.

Alternatively, perhaps each enantiomer forms two products, leading to four products in total.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the Grubbs catalyst leads to more than one product due to different possible reaction pathways.

Wait, but without knowing the exact mechanism, it's challenging to determine.

But perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when a racemic starting material undergoes a reaction that can produce stereoisomers, the number of possible products depends on the reaction's outcome.

In this case, perhaps each enantiomer produces a different product, leading to two products.

But the options have D)2 as an option.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single product, regardless of the starting material's configuration.

In that case, only one product would form, but the options don't have one.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two possible products, each from one enantiomer of the starting material.

So the answer would be D)2.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to four products, considering the possible diastereomers and enantiomers.

But I'm getting stuck. Another approach: think about the number of possible products.

If the reaction leads to the formation of a cyclopentene ring, and the substituents can be arranged in two different ways (endo or exo), perhaps leading to two products.

But considering the starting material's stereochemistry, each would produce a different product, leading to four.

But without knowing for sure, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)2, as each enantiomer of the starting material would produce a distinct product, leading to two possible products.


The problem involves treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst, which facilitates olefin metathesis. Grubbs catalyst typically breaks and reforms double bonds, leading to the redistribution of alkyl groups. The starting material, 3-methylpent-1-ene, has the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH₂CH₃. This molecule is racemic, meaning it is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers, implying the presence of a chiral center.

The reaction likely proceeds via ring-closing metathesis, where the catalyst connects two ends of the molecule to form a ring, releasing ethene as a byproduct (which is excluded from the count). The possible ring sizes depend on which carbons are connected. Connecting C1 and C5 would form a five-membered ring (cyclopentene), while connecting C1 and C4 would form a four-membered ring. However, four-membered rings are less favorable due to ring strain, so the five-membered ring is the major product.

The product is a substituted cyclopentene. The substituents (methyl and ethyl groups) on the ring depend on the starting material's stereochemistry. Since the starting material is racemic, each enantiomer would produce a different diastereomer of the product. This results in two possible products, corresponding to the two enantiomers of the starting material.

Thus, the number of possible products (excluding ethene) is **2**.

Answer: D
