Okay, I'm trying to figure out which compound X is based on the given NMR data after the reaction. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the reaction conditions: Compound X reacts with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Wait, no, actually, Sharpless uses a different catalyst, like a titanium-based one with a chiral ligand. Oh wait, maybe it's related to epoxidation. Epoxidation typically converts alkenes into epoxides. So, the reaction is probably an epoxidation of a double bond in compound X. So, the product would be an epoxide.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlets, each integrating to 3H. So, two methyl groups. One is maybe attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or part of a substituent.
- Then, there are signals in the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So, this looks like a substituted styrene system. Let me think: two doublets each integrating to 2H and 1H. Hmm, perhaps a coupling between substituents on a benzene ring.

The 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7 ppm, which is a strong indicator of an epoxide (epoxide carbons are around 55-70 ppm, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 197.7 is high. Maybe a carbonyl group? Or an ester? Wait, no, epoxides don't have carbonyls. Oh wait, maybe a ketone? Or maybe I'm confusing. Wait, 197.7 is a carbonyl. So, could there be a ketone in the product? Wait, but the reaction is an epoxidation, which adds an oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound had a double bond, and the epoxidation added an oxygen, creating an epoxide. So, the product would have an epoxide group. Let me think about the NMR signals.

Epoxide protons can appear around δ 3-4, but in the given 1H NMR, I don't see signals in that region. Oh wait, maybe they're deshielded or perhaps the epoxide is part of a more substituted system. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is in a rigid structure, making the protons exchange or not show as split.

Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is part of a structure that's causing the neighboring protons to split in a certain way. But looking at the H NMR, the only signals are at 2.28, 2.31 (methyls), and the aromatic signals. So, perhaps the epoxide protons are not appearing as separate signals, maybe because they're exchanging, or perhaps the epoxide is part of a conjugated system where the protons are not split.

Wait, another thought: maybe the epoxide is part of a six-membered ring, making the epoxide protons equivalent and perhaps as a singlet? But that's not matching the data here. Alternatively, the epoxide may have protons that are not observed because they're part of a different environment, perhaps in a very deshielded region, but I don't see any other peaks. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the product, the epoxide is formed, but the structure is such that the epoxide protons are not split into multiple peaks or are in a region that's not shown. Wait, but the 1H NMR given only shows the listed peaks. So maybe the epoxide's protons are not present because they are in another region? Or perhaps they're not there because the epoxide is part of a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait a minute, let's think about the options given. The options are A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane, C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, D) 2-styrylepoxide.

Wait, all these options are oxirane derivatives, meaning they have an epoxide ring. So, the product is an epoxide. So, the starting material X is a diene or another structure that upon epoxidation forms one of these.

But wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I think that's the base used in some epoxidations, but I'm not exactly
