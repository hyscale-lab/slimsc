Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see. The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and I need to choose the correct major products from the given options.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, which usually implies an elimination reaction or maybe a conjugate addition in some cases. Wait, but ethyl acrylate is an ester with a double bond. Oh, right! So perhaps this is a Michael addition. I think the cyclohexanone is acting as a nucleophile because the base deprotonates it, making it enolate, which then attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester (ethyl acrylate) in a conjugate addition.

So the enolate would attack the beta position of the ethyl acrylate. Let me visualize the structure. The starting compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The ketone is at position 1, so the numbering is a bit tricky. Let me draw it mentally. The cyclohexane ring has the ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl, but wait, no: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl, and position 6 has another methyl? Or wait, maybe it's 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Or perhaps the structure is where the ring has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). Wait, maybe I should number them: positions 1 (ketone), 2 (ethyl and methyl), and 6 (methyl).

When the base deprotonates the ketone, the enolate forms. The most substituted position would be the most stable. So where are the alpha hydrogens? The alpha carbons are adjacent to the ketone. So for cyclohexanone, the alpha positions are at positions 2 and 6. But in the given compound, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl, so perhaps the substituents are arranged such that there's more steric hindrance at position 2, making it harder to form the enolate there. Alternatively, the enolate might form at position 3 or another position? Wait, no, the enolate in cyclohexanone typically forms at the alpha positions, which are adjacent to the ketone (so position 2 and position 6, maybe). But with substituents, the more substituted enolate is more favorable. So if the cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2 and 6, the enolate could form at either, but perhaps position 2 is more substituted.

Wait, the starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there are substituents: an ethyl and a methyl. At position 6, another methyl. So when the enolate forms, the base would abstract a proton either from position 2 or position 6. But position 2 has more substituents (ethyl and methyl), so maybe the enolate forms at position 6 because it's less hindered? Or wait, maybe it's more substituted. Alternatively, maybe the major enolate is the more substituted one for stability. So in 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone, the alpha hydrogens are at C2 and C6.

Wait, the structure would be:

Positions 1: ketone,

Position 2: ethyl and methyl (so substituents at 2 and 2?), wait no. Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. At position 6, a methyl group. So the substitu
