Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O). So the molecule must have an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the aromatic protons would split into two sets. So maybe the substituents are in a para or ortho arrangement. Wait, in a para substitution, each aromatic proton is equivalent, so maybe only one peak for all four H. But wait, the question says two signals. Hmm, maybe they are in an ortho arrangement, but that can give two sets. Or perhaps the substituents are such that there are two different environments for the aromatic protons.

Wait, wait. Di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would be all equivalent, so one peak. If in the meta, perhaps similar? Or in the ortho, but that would lead to two sets of protons, maybe two peaks. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that's not symmetrical, causing the aromatic protons to split into two different signals. So two signals for aromatic H makes me think of a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are not symmetrical, leading to two sets of aromatic protons.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring, but in this case, since it's an ester, perhaps part of a substituent group like an ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, esters usually are R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, esters are more like R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the substituent on the benzene is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, but that might not have vinyl H. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached, like maybe an acrylate group. So for example, something like -CO-O-CH2-CH2- might not have vinyl H, but if it's an ester with a double bond, then the vinyl H would be present.

Wait, another thought: the two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, which suggests coupling with one neighbor. The other is a doublet of quartets, which is more complex. What kind of structures have vinyl H that split into such patterns? Perhaps adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems.

3. Two signals for -CH3 groups. So there are two different methyl groups in the molecule. Since the substituents are on the benzene, maybe each substituent has a methyl group, but they're in different environments.

And importantly, there are no signals for -CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene (-CH2-) groups. That might suggest that any substituents don't have two adjacent CH2 groups, perhaps they're either terminal or connected to other substituents.

So putting this together, the molecule is a di-substituted benzene with two ester groups? Wait, no, the ester group is a functional group, so perhaps each substituent is an ester, or maybe one substituent is an ester and another is something else.

Wait, wait. The FTIR shows an ester group. So the molecule must have at least one ester group. Could it have two ester groups? That's possible, but let's see. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else.

But let me think about the NMR again. The six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two methyl. Let's outline possible structures.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is part of the ester.

Wait, another angle: the est
