Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each a sequence of reactions, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, let's see. The target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 2, 1, and 3 respectively, which I think translates to positions 1, 2, and 3 in the numbering. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering might be important here. Let me sketch it out mentally. So the nitro group is in position 3, tert-butyl in 2, and ethoxy in 1? Or maybe I should think about the order in which these groups are added to the benzene ring.

In synthesis, the directing effects of substituents matter a lot. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the existing groups. If a group is activating, it directs incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Deactivating groups do the opposite.

The target molecule has nitro (a strong meta director), ethoxy (ortho/para director, activating), and tert-butyl (a bulky group, but since it's an alkyl group, it's ortho/para directing and activating). Wait, but wait: nitro is meta-directing, while ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating and o/p-directing.

So, the order in which these groups are added will determine the positions of each substituent. Let me plan the steps.

Benzene is the starting material. The first substituent we add will determine the positions of the next substituents.

Optionally, perhaps adding the nitro group first. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Once nitro is attached, the next substituent will be directed by the nitro.

Wait, but I'm looking at the target molecule: the nitro is in position 3, ethoxy in 1, and tert-butyl in 2. Hmm, maybe the sequence is adding nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl? Or perhaps adding tert-butyl first, then nitro.

Wait, but let's think about each step:

1. Let's say the first substituent is the tert-butyl group. AlCl3 is a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So if we start by adding the tert-butyl group using AlCl3 and tert-butyl chloride, benzene would get the tert-butyl group. Since tert-butyl is a bulky group, the next substituent would be directed meta or para relative to it.

Wait, but after adding tert-butyl, if the next step is adding nitro, which is a strong deactivating group. So after adding the tert-butyl, the next substituent would be directed by it. Since the tert-butyl is a meta director? No, wait: alkyl groups are activating and ortho/para directors. So the nitro group would be added in either ortho or para positions relative to tert-butyl. But in the target, the nitro is in position 3, which is meta relative to the tert-butyl in position 2. Wait, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the first substituent is the nitro group. Then, when adding the ethoxy group, it would go in a position directed by the nitro.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Add tert-butyl group (Friedel-Crafts alkylation).
2. Add nitro group in the meta position relative to tert-butyl.
3. Then add ethoxy group, which is an activating group, but since nitro is deactivating, perhaps the ethoxy is added in a position influenced by both substituents.

Wait, but nitro is a strong deactivating group, so after adding nitro, the ring is less reactive. If you then try to add ethoxy, which is activating, but where?

Wait, perhaps I should look for the sequence of reactions in the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. So benzene becomes nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: probably a reduction step, but wait, Fe/HCl is used in the nitro reduction (like to amine?), but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a demethylation or something else. Hmm, maybe after nitration, they try to add another group.

But wait, if the first step is nitration, you get nitrobenzene. The next step is Fe and HCl. Wait, nitrobenzene is meta directing. If you do something with Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a substitution? Wait, Fe/HCl is also a catalyst for some reactions. Alternatively, maybe a Birch reduction? Or perhaps it's a step to prepare something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitro group being reduced to amine, but then what's next?

Option D's step iii) is tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3. So Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, nitro groups are deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not work because the ring is deactivated. Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups to direct electrophiles. So if the ring has a nitro group, can Friedel-Crafts occur? I don't think so because the ring is deactivated. So maybe option D is not correct because after nitration, you can't do Friedel-Crafts.

Hmm. Let's think again. Maybe the first substituent is the tert-butyl, then nitro, then ethoxy.

So first, Friedel-Crafts to add tert-butyl. Then, nitration. Since tert-butyl is activating and ortho/para directing, the nitro group would go either ortho or para to it. Let's say para. Then, where would the ethoxy go?

Wait, the target has ethoxy in position 1, nitro in 3, and tert-butyl in 2. So maybe the substituents are arranged in such a way that each is in the correct position based on the order of addition.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are: first add ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Or perhaps another order.

Wait, another approach: looking at the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So if we imagine the benzene ring with three substituents around it, each is at adjacent positions? Because 1,2,3 are consecutive. So perhaps the substituents are added in a way that each is added in a position directed by the previous groups.

Let me think about the order:

Option 1: Add tert-butyl first. Then, nitration occurs in the meta position relative to tert-butyl. Then, adding ethoxy.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring has two substituents: tert-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and nitro (deactivating, meta). Where would the ethoxy group go?

Wait, when there are multiple substituents, the most deactivating group usually directs the incoming electrophile. Or the strongest director.

Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So when adding the ethoxy group, the nitro group would dominate the direction.

So, the ethoxy would enter meta to the nitro group. But if the nitro is already in position 3 relative to the tert-butyl, then adding ethoxy as meta to nitro would place it in position 5 or something. Hmm, maybe not matching the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added before the nitro, but that might not be possible because ethoxy is activating, so nitration would be directed by ethoxy.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: add tert-butyl to benzene.

2. Then, add ethoxy group via another Friedel-Crafts? Wait, no, because ethoxy is an ether group. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should look at all the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: add tert-butyl.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration. So benzene becomes nitrobenzene, but wait, no, first substituent is tert-butyl. So after step i, you have tert-butylbenzene.

Then, nitration: since tert-butyl is ortho/para directing, the nitro group could go in para or ortho positions relative to tert-butyl.

Let's say para. Then, in step iii: Fe/HCl. Hmm, what's that for? Maybe reduction of nitro to amine? Not sure. Then step iv: HNO3 again? That would be another nitration, but the target has only one nitro group.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Option B's steps:
