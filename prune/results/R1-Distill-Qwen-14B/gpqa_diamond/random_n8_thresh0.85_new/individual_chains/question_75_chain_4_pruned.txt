Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the setup: The researcher wants to overexpress GADD45G in mice to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They modified the gene to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But the protein isn't overexpressing as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to find the issue. Let's think about how the construct is designed. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it should be one of the first amino acids. I'll look for the start codon and see if there's any issue around it.

The sequence starts with 5' ATG, which is the methionine start codon. That's correct. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but the HA tag sequence is supposed to be added before the GADD45G coding sequence. Oh, but maybe I should check if the HA tag is correctly incorporated.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, right? Its coding sequence would be something like YPYDVPDYA. The DNA sequence for that would start after the ATG. Let me check the given sequence.

The first few codons after ATG are TAC (TYR), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (TYR) again. Hmm, wait. The HA tag's DNA sequence is usually something like ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, let me think. The HA epitope is usually encoded by the sequence: TAC CCA TAC GAT GAT GAC GAC. Wait, let's break it down. The HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA, so each amino acid translates from DNA:

Y -> TAC
P -> CCA
Y -> TAC
D -> GAT
V -> GTA
P -> CCA
D -> GAT
Y -> TAC
A -> GCT?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the exact sequence wrong, but let's see the beginning of the provided sequence. After ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y). So the HA tag's first three codons are there. That seems correct. Then next is GAT (D), GAT (D), GAT (D) again? Wait, the provided sequence has TAC CCA TAC GAT GAT GAT. Hmm, but that would be Y, P, Y, D, D, D... That doesn't look right. Wait, maybe the HA tag is intended to be YPYDVPDYA, which would translate to the DNA sequence: TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT GTA CCA TAC GCT.

Wait, maybe the issue is that the HA tag isn't properly followed by the correct sequence. Let me think: the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, so the construct should have the HA coding sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. If there's a problem in the HA sequence, maybe it's causing issues with translation.

Wait, looking at the given DNA sequence, after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GAT (D), GAT (D), TCC (S), etc. So the HA tag would be Y-P-Y-D-D-D-S... Wait, that doesn't seem right. The HA epitope is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. So the DNA sequence for that would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT GTA CCA TAC GCT.

Wait, so in the given sequence, after the initial ATG, the codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT,
