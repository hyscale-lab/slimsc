Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the scenario is about a researcher trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid with an inducible overexpression construct for GADD45G. They also added a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the protein for affinity purification. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But they can't overexpress the protein. The question is why.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, the plus strand is given. I need to analyze this sequence to find the issue.

First, I should probably look for any obvious errors in the DNA sequence that might prevent proper protein expression. Let's break it down.

The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the first part of the protein should be the HA sequence. But wait, the provided sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me check the first few codons.

ATG is methionine, that's correct. Then TAC is tyrosine. Wait, HA is a specific peptide, so maybe the HA tag is part of the sequence. So the initial part should code for the HA epitope.

Wait, the HA tag is the HA determinant from influenza. The HA protein has a specific sequence, but the tag is usually a short peptide, often around 10 amino acids. The HA tag's coding sequence is something like: 

HA tag is typically 6 His followed by a thrombin site and a FLAG tag? No, wait, no. The HA tag is a specific epitope. The actual HA tag is a short peptide. The coding sequence for HA is often like: 

The HA tag is derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. The epitope is usually around 11 amino acids. The coding sequence for this epitope starts with ATG (Met) followed by the codons for the HA residues.

Wait, but the construct's sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Let me write down the first few codons:

ATG = Met

TAC = Tyr

CCA = Pro

TAC = Tyr

GAT = Asp

GTT = Val

So, Met-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val... Hmm, does this match any known HA tag sequence? Alternatively, maybe the HA tag should be added as a fusion, so perhaps the start is the HA sequence followed by GADD45G.

Wait, but the problem says they introduced the HA determinant at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the construct should start with HA coding, then GADD45G.

Wait, but the provided DNA sequence starts with ATG TAC... which is Met-Tyr. So perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is not correctly included. Alternatively, maybe there's a frame shift or a stop codon in the sequence.

Wait, looking at the start, after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), etc. I don't think that's the HA sequence. The HA epitope is usually around 11 amino acids. Let me think about the HA coding sequence.

The HA tag is usually encoded by a sequence like: ATG GTA AAA GCT GAA GAA TCT CGT CGC GAA GCT GCT CGG TTG (I might be getting this wrong, but it's a common HA tag sequence). Alternatively, the standard HA tag is: YPYDVPDYA. So, the DNA sequence for that would be:

YPYDVPDYA: which is Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Asp Tyr Ala.

Wait, but that's the amino acid sequence. So the DNA would be:

Tyr: TAC

Pro: CCA

Tyr: TAC

Asp: GAT

Val: GTT

Pro: CCA

Asp: GAT

Tyr: TAC

Ala: GCT

So the DNA would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT.

But wait, the sequence given starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Hmm, that's ATG, then TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), G... Wait, the next codon after GAT is GAA or something else? Let me check.

Wait, let me write out the first 20 bases:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T CC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC...

Wait, no, perhaps the sequence has a stop codon early on.

Wait, looking at the sequence:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G T T CC AGA TTA CGC... Wait, perhaps I should check for any in-frame stop codons.

Looking in triplets:

ATG (start)

TAC (Tyr)

CCA (Pro)

TAC (Tyr)

GAT (Asp)

GTT (Val)

CCAGA (Wait, no, the next part is CC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT... Let's list the entire sequence in codons:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCAGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC...

Wait, perhaps I should break it into 3-letter codons:

Wait, I think I'm getting lost here. Maybe looking for stop codons. The possible stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA.

Looking through the sequence, let's check:

The first part:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA TTA ...

So codon 7 is CCA (Pro), 8 is GAA (E), 9 is TTA (Leu), 10 is CGC (R), 11 is CAA (Q), 12 is ATG (Met). Wait! ATG is a start codon. Oh, wait, that's in the middle of the sequence. So after codon 11 (CAA), the next is ATG which is a start codon. So the ribosome would start translating from there, creating a new ORF. That could be a problem. So the initial ATG is the start, but then after several codons, there's another ATG which is in the same reading frame. But wait, let me think about how that affects the reading frame.

Wait, the initial ATG is the start, then after 11 codons, another ATG is at position 12. So 12 is ATG, which is Met. So the sequence would be:

Met Tyr Pro Tyr Asp Val Pro Glu Leu Arg Gln Met Thr Leu Glu...

Wait, but the presence of another Met in the same frame doesn't necessarily cause a problem unless there's a stop before or after. Hmm. Wait, but if the HA tag is supposed to be before the GADD45G sequence, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is not present, leading to the wrong protein.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. But the provided sequence starts with ATG, which would be the start of the HA coding, but then within the HA coding, perhaps a stop codon is present. Or perhaps the HA sequence is not correctly included, leading the construct to start with GADD45G without the HA tag. Or is there a stop codon in the HA sequence?

Wait, looking again at the first part: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC...

Wait, the 12th codon is ATG (Met), which would be a start, but in the same frame. So what's happening here? So the initial ORF starts with ATG, and then at codon 12, another ATG. So that would mean that the original ORF has a Met at position 13 (since codon 1 is position 1-3, codon 2:4-6, etc.). So position 36 is the 12th codon, which is ATG. So the initial Met is at the beginning, and then another Met at position 36. But the ORF doesn't have any stop codons before that, so the translation would continue past the second Met.

Wait, but that would mean the HA tag is being expressed, followed by the GADD45G. Alternatively, perhaps the HA coding sequence is messed up.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA tag is not present because the initial part is not the HA sequence. Let me think, the HA tag is a short sequence. If the HA tag is not correctly inserted, then the protein would not have the HA tag, but the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag has a stop codon within it.

Wait, another possibility: the plasmid construct might have a premature stop codon in the HA sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early, leading to no full-length protein. Looking at the first 20 codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. CCA (Pro)
4. TAC (Tyr)
5. GAT (Asp)
6. GTT (Val)
7. CCA (Pro)
8. GAA (Glu)
9. TTA (Leu)
10. CGC (Arg)
11. CAA (Gln)
12. ATG (Met)
13. ACT (Thr)
14. CTG (Leu)
15. GAA (Glu)
16. GAA (Glu)
17. TCC (Ser)
18. GCC (Ala)
19. AGG (Arg)
20. ACA (Thr)

Hmm, I don't see any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the first 20. Let's check further.

Wait, I don't see any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the entire sequence. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Another thought: Maybe the HA tag is not present because the plasmid was not correctly cloned, but the provided sequence starts with ATG, which is the start of the HA coding. But perhaps the HA coding sequence is not correctly designed, leading to a frame shift or no HA tag.

Wait, but looking at the initial part, the ATG is followed by TAC, which is Tyr. The HA tag should have a specific sequence. The HA tag's coding sequence is usually something like ATG GTA AAA GCT GAA GAA TCT CGT CGC (etc.), but I'm not exactly sure. Perhaps the HA sequence is not correctly present in the construct.

Wait, let me think about the HA tag. The HA tag is a short peptide, around 11 amino acids. So the coding sequence should be about 33 nucleotides (since each codon is 3 nt). But looking at the first part of the provided sequence, it's way longer than that. So perhaps the entire HA coding wasn't added, and the construct is only expressing GADD45G without the HA tag, which could be a problem for purification. But the researcher's goal was to overexpress the HA-tagged GADD45G.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So maybe the HA tag isn't there, but why would that prevent expression? Unless the HA tag is necessary for the stability or expression of the protein. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag introduces a premature stop codon, but I don't see any in the sequence.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is followed by a linker. If the linker is missing, perhaps the protein is being processed or not expressed. But the question says they introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus, so the HA should be first.

Wait, looking at the given options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So maybe the HA tag's DNA has a mutation leading to incorrect amino acids, so the tag isn't recognized. But this would affect purification, not necessarily expression levels.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would require a stop codon in the mRNA. I don't see any in the sequence, so this is unlikely.

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. If there's no linker between HA and GADD45G, maybe the protein is being degraded. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag without a linker leads to misfolding, causing the protein to be recognized as foreign and degraded.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. But UAA is a stop codon, and all organisms have mechanisms to handle stop codons. Moreover, the provided sequence doesn't have a UAA codon; it has TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Wait, wait. Let me check the sequence again for any in-frame stop codons. Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA in triplets.

Looking through all of these, I don't see any TAA, TAG, TGA stop codons. So option B (early termination) is unlikely.

Option A: The HA sequence has a mutation leading to a missense. But the HA tag itself is a short peptide. If the HA sequence is wrong, the tag wouldn't work, but the construct would still be expressed. The problem is that the protein isn't expressed, so this might not be the cause unless the HA tag's mutation introduces a premature stop codon, which I don't see.

Wait, another angle: maybe the HA tag was not properly incorporated into the construct. Looking at the sequence, it starts with ATG, which is correct for the start. But perhaps the HA coding wasn't correctly inserted, leading the protein to start with GADD45G without the HA tag. But that wouldn't prevent expression; it would just mean the HA isn't present.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is present but without a proper start codon or in a different reading frame. Wait, the sequence starts with ATG, so it's in frame. But if the HA sequence isn't correctly added, like if the HA tag is in a different frame, but the question says the HA is at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein, so it's in the same frame.

Another possibility: The HA tag is followed by a linker that was omitted. Without a linker, the protein might be subject to proteolysis. The linker usually provides a flexible region and can prevent premature termination by the proteasome. If the linker is missing, the ribosome might terminate early (option B), but we don't see stop codons.

Alternatively, the problem is that the GADD45G coding sequence was not cloned correctly. But the provided DNA is the plus strand, and it's just a long sequence of codons without any stop codons, so it's being translated into a long protein. So why isn't it expressed?

Wait, another angle: the sequence for the HA tag might be in the opposite orientation. But the question says the HA is at the N-terminus, so the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G, both in the same frame. If the HA is in the wrong orientation, that could cause issues. But the sequence starts with ATG, which suggests it's in the correct direction.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence is the same as the GADD45G's start. No, the HA is a separate addition.

Wait, another thought: the HA tag is usually followed by a protease cleavage site. If the linker is missing, perhaps the HA tag remains, and the protein is not processed, but that wouldn't prevent expression. It would just prevent purification if the HA isn't cleaved.

Alternatively, maybe the HA tag was inserted in the wrong place, like within the GADD45G coding sequence, causing a frame shift and introducing a premature stop. But in the given sequence, the HA sequence seems to be followed by the GADD45G sequence without any frame shifts, as the codons continue correctly.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me check the very beginning of the sequence again. The first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GC...

So, the first codon is ATG (Met), the next is TAC (Tyr), etc. The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so that part should be the HA sequence. But perhaps the HA sequence is not correctly added. The HA coding sequence is perhaps not included, so the construct starts with GADD45G's coding sequence. But why would that prevent expression? It shouldn't; the protein should be expressed, just without the HA tag. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed.

Another possibility: the selection marker or promoter is not working. But the question states that the antibiotic-resistant cell colonies were selected, so the plasmid has a functional selection marker. The problem is expression, not plasmid maintenance.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

If the linker is missing, the HA tag and GADD45G might form a structure that is recognized by proteases, leading to degradation. So the protein is made but rapidly degraded, leading to low detection in expression tests.

But why would a linker be needed? Usually, a linker provides flexibility and ensures proper folding. Without it, the two domains (HA and GADD45G) might be joined in a way that causes misfolding, making the protein unstable and leading to degradation via the proteasome. This would explain why the protein isn't present in detectable amounts.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate early if there's no proper stop codon after it. But without a stop codon, the ribosome would continue translating until a natural stop is encountered.

Wait, but in the provided sequence, there's no stop codon until the very end. Looking at the last part:

... AGT TGA ... Wait, let me check the end.

The sequence ends with:

... CCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, looking for TGA towards the end:

Looking at the last part:

... ATCTGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

So the very end has ... TGA. Let's see: ...GAGTGA.

Breaking it down into codons, the last few are:

CAG TGA

CAG is Gln, TGA is a stop codon.

So the very end has a TGA, which is a stop codon. So the entire coding sequence ends with a stop codon. So that's correct; the protein should terminate after that.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed. So why would the HA tag cause the ribosome to terminate early? Because the HA tag's coding sequence is not followed by a stop codon. Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the HA coding should be followed by the GADD45G coding and then a stop. But the provided sequence includes the HA coding, followed by GADD45G, and ends with a stop codon. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the HA coding sequence is not correctly inserted. If the HA sequence was inserted in the wrong frame, the initial codons would be different. But according to the provided sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is correct. So the HA should be in frame.

Hmm... Another thought: Perhaps the HA tag is not followed by a proper Kozak sequence or other initiation elements. But the construct starts with ATG, which is a start codon, so that should be okay.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA tag's coding sequence is not present. Because the provided sequence starts with ATG, which is the start of GADD45G's own coding, not HA. But the question states that the HA is at the N-terminus, so the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the HA sequence was mistakenly omitted, so the construct is just GADD45G without the HA tag. But that wouldn't prevent expression; it would just mean the HA isn't there. The question is about why the protein isn't being overexpressed.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is followed by a premature stop codon. Looking at the first part again, after the initial ATG, the next codons are TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAA, TTA, CGC, CAA, ATG, etc. The 12th codon is ATG, which is another start codon. So the ribosome would read from the first ATG, and when it hits the second ATG, it might start a new reading frame.

Wait, no, because the ribosome reads in the same frame. So the initial ATG is the start, and the next codons are in the same frame. So the 12th codon is ATG, which is another start codon, but it's in the same reading frame. So the ribosome would continue translating, producing a Met at position 13. But that's just another amino acid; it doesn't cause a stop. So the presence of another Met in the same frame doesn't lead to termination.

Wait, but perhaps the HA coding sequence is longer than it should be, leading the ribosome to read into the GADD45G coding. But that doesn't explain the lack of expression.

Wait, another possibility: the HA tag is correctly placed, but the GADD45G coding sequence has a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon. But in the provided sequence, I don't see any stop codons, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's presence introduces a cryptic promoter or another issue, but that seems less likely.

Wait, another angle: the HA tag is at the N-terminus, but the way it was cloned might have caused a frameshift. Let me see: if the HA tag was inserted in a way that disrupts the reading frame of GADD45G, but the provided sequence continues correctly without any frameshift, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's addition didn't include a proper start codon, but the construct starts with ATG, so that's included.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

The researcher added the HA tag at the N-terminus. They transfected CHO cells, selected for antibiotic resistance, but couldn't overexpress the protein.

Looking at the options:

Option C says that the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. So if the HA tag is directly fused to GADD45G without a linker, the protein might be unstable. That could lead to low expression levels because the protein is rapidly degraded.

But how would that work? The linker provides a flexible region that allows the HA tag and the target protein to fold properly. Without a linker, the two might be too close, causing misfolding and leading the protein to be recognized as abnormal and degraded.

So the issue could be that the HA tag is present but without a linker, leading to proteolysis of the nascent chain. This would explain why the protein isn't being overexpressed—it's being broken down quickly.

Looking at the options, option C is about the lack of a linker causing proteolysis. So that would make sense.

Another option, option B, is that the ribosome terminates early. But since there's no stop codon in the coding sequence before the end, that's not the case.

Option A suggests a missense mutation in the HA sequence. But that would affect the HA epitope, not the expression level.

Option D is about the tRNA for UAA not existing, but UAA is a stop codon, and all cells have mechanisms to recognize it.

So the most plausible answer is option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis.


The question involves a researcher attempting to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researcher introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein for affinity purification. However, the protein failed to overexpress in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The provided DNA sequence represents the coding region of the construct, and the task is to identify the reason for the lack of expression.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Sequence Overview**:  
   The sequence starts with `ATG`, the canonical start codon, followed by a series of codons. The sequence does not contain any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) until the very end, where `TGA` is present. This suggests that the ribosome would translate the entire sequence into a full-length protein.

2. **HA Tag Considerations**:  
   The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. However, the initial part of the sequence does not match the expected HA tag sequence. Instead, the sequence appears to represent the GADD45G protein without the HA tag. This could mean the HA tag was not correctly incorporated into the construct.

3. **Premature Termination**:  
   There are no stop codons in the sequence before the final `TGA`. Thus, the ribosome would not terminate early, making Option B unlikely.

4. **Missense Mutation in HA Tag**:  
   If the HA tag were present, a missense mutation could affect its recognition. However, this would primarily impact purification, not expression levels. Since the protein is not being expressed at all, this is not the primary issue.

5. **Lack of Linker Sequence**:  
   Without a linker between the HA tag and GADD45G, the two domains might be too close, leading to misfolding or improper interactions. This could cause the protein to be recognized as abnormal and degraded by proteases, resulting in low expression levels. This explanation aligns with Option C.

6. **tRNA for UAA**:  
   All organisms recognize stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA), and the provided sequence does not rely on a UAA codon for termination. Thus, Option D is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis of the nascent chain, leading to the degradation of the HA-tagged GADD45G protein and preventing its overexpression.
