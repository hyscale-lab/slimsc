Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, they're both in circular orbits. 

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but their radii are the same. So for both stars, radius R is the same.

I need to find out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. So the probability of transit depends on the orbital configuration—specifically, the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight.

The formula for the probability of a transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (a√(1-e² + ... ))), but wait, for circular orbits (e=0), the probability simplifies. Wait, no, the transit probability formula I recall is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (a√(1 - (R_p/a)^2))) )? Or maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, no. The probability is actually the ratio of the size of the star to the distance, or something like that. Let me think. The probability (P) that a planet transits is given by P = (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 + (M_p sin i)/(M_s))) ), but wait, no, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is more about the orbital geometry. The probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, is aligned such that it transits the star. The formula is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by something else, but I think the main factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit.

Wait, another approach: the probability of a transit is given by (R_s + R_p)^2 / (a
