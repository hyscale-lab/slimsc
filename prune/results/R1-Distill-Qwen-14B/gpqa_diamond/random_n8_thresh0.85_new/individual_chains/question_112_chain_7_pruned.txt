Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states in the z-basis. So probably, the first thing I need to do is normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, but the actual question is about an operator with a specific matrix representation. The operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so for a 2x2 matrix since it's dealing with spin-1/2 particles. So let me write that matrix out. 

In a 2x2 system, the matrix would be:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Because when i ≠ j, the elements are ħ/2, and diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. So this operator looks like it's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, that's exactly it. So this operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, no. Wait, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, right. So the operator A is (ħ/2) * σ_x. Because σ_x has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal. So A would be:

A = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x, but scaled by ħ/2. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be ± ħ/2.

But wait, the question is asking about the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate of operator A. So I need to find the eigenstates of A, express |alpha> in that basis, and then find the probabilities. Or perhaps more accurately, since A is diagonal in its own eigenbasis, the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate.

Wait, but maybe I should approach it step by step.

First, let me write down the state |alpha>.

Given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So I should normalize this state. Let's compute the normalization factor.

The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|(1+i)|^2 + |2 -i|^2). Let's compute each modulus squared.

|1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2.

|2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Got it.

Now, the operator A has matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So as I thought, it's (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So its eigenstates are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of A as well, since A is a scaled version of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the eigenstates of A are the same, because scaling a matrix by a scalar doesn't change its eigenvectors, only the eigenvalues.

So let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+> and |->, where:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),

|-> = (|up
