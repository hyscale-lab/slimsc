Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like a mass on a spring. But wait, this is relativistic, which means I probably have to consider special relativity effects.

The problem states: It's a 1-dimensional system, mass m, maximum amplitude A, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. We're supposed to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh right, the options are given, but I need to think through the steps.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², right? Then the kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², so v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) which is option C. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. Here, it's relativistic, so option C is probably not the correct answer.

In relativity, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it's the total energy. The total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the potential energy in this case is still (1/2)kx², but when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential.

Wait, no, wait. At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest in terms of velocity, so actually, the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic. But wait, no, no. Wait, for a harmonic oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies oscillate. So at x=0, the speed is maximum, so the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential is zero. So actually, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum KE is when the speed is maximum.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. It's actually gamma mc² minus m c². Because relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc².

So, let me think. The total energy E of the oscillator should be the same everywhere. At maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero (since the velocity is zero there). So E = (1/2)kA² + 0, but also E = gamma mc². So, (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

Wait, but that can't be right because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and all the energy is in potential form. So E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, is the potential energy still (1/2)kx²? I think that's the case because the force is still F = -kx, so the potential is the integral of F, which would be (1/2)kx². So yes.

So when the oscillator is at x = A, v=0,
