Okay, I've got a chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I need to think through it carefully.

The problem states that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions usually involve an acid and a base reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for these reactions is typically exothermic, which is why the options are all negative values—since exothermic reactions release heat.

First, I think I should figure out how much of each acid and base we're dealing with. Because when they mix, the acids (HCl and H2SO4) will react with the base (Ba(OH)2).

Wait, but how do these react? I know that HCl is a strong acid and will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, the second dissociation is weaker. But for neutralization purposes, especially with strong bases, I think both H+ ions are available. So H2SO4 will contribute 2 H+ ions per molecule.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and will dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^- ions, right? Because the formula is Ba(OH)2, so for each mole, there are 2 moles of OH^-.

So, the reaction will be between H+ ions from the acids and OH^- ions from the base. The total H+ from both acids will react with the OH^- from the base. But I need to determine which one is in excess because the neutralization depends on the limiting reagent.

Let's calculate the moles of each.

Starting with HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 500 mL = 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is HCl → H+ + Cl^-, so 0.1 moles H+.

Then H2SO4: 0.3 M, 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so 0.09 *2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2, 0.5 M, 200 mL = 0.2 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^-, that's 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH^-.

So, the H+ is 0.28 moles, OH^- is 0.2 moles. Which one is in excess?

The reaction is H+ + OH^- → H2O. So the OH^- will react with H+.

Since OH^- is 0.2 moles, it can react with 0.2 moles of H+. Then, the remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. So, H+ is in excess.

Wait, that means the reaction will proceed until OH^- is consumed. So the neutralization is based on the available OH^-.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ reacting with OH^-.

Each mole of H+ reacting releases a certain amount of energy. For strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ/mol (but wait, is it per mole of H+ or per mole of reaction? I think it's per mole of H+ reacting).

Wait, no. Let me think. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH^- from a base to form water. So, for a monoprotic acid and a base like NaOH, the enthalpy is about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

But here, one of the acids is diprotic (H2SO4). So, each mole of H2SO4 contributes two moles of H+.

Wait, but when calculating the neutralization, each H+ reacts with an OH^-.

So, the total amount of H+ is 0.28 moles, and OH^- is 0.2 moles. So, 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles of OH^-.

So the number of moles of neutralization is 0.2.

Each mole of H+ reacting releases about 57 kJ, but since the reaction is exothermic, the enthalpy change would be negative.

Wait, but wait. The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH^-), right? So for each mole of H+ reacting, it's -57 kJ.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would release 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. Hmm, but the options don't have that exactly. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. Another thought: maybe the enthalpy is per mole of reaction, and for a diprotic acid, the second H+ doesn't release as much because it's a weaker acid or something. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ should dissociate completely.

Wait, but in the case of H2SO4, when it reacts with a base, the first H+ is as strong as HCl, the second is weaker but in this case, perhaps both are considered strong enough to contribute fully. So for the neutralization, each H+ contributes 57 kJ.

Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy is per mole of acid reacting. For HCl, it's 1 H+, so 57 kJ per mole of HCl. For H2SO4, because it's diprotic, each mole contributes 2 H+ → 2 * 57 = 114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

But I'm a little confused now. Let me think again.

The way I approached before: the reaction is H+ + OH^- → H2O. Each mole of H+ gives -57 kJ.

So, the limiting reagent here is OH^-; there's 0.2 moles, so the neutralization is 0.2 moles.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is close to -11.4 kJ but in kilocalories.

Wait, but wait—this is a critical point. Are the units in kJ or kcal?

The question says "enthalpy of neutralization", which is usually given in kJ/mol, but sometimes in kcal/mol. Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of reaction), but sometimes it's given as -28.4 kcal per mole (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 57 kJ ≈ 13.6 kcal). Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 1 cal = 4.184 J. So 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is equal to about 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

Wait, wait, no. 57 kJ is 57,000 J. To convert to kcal: 57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.6 kcal.

Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me calculate:

57,000 J = 57 kJ.

1 kcal = 4184 J.

57,000 J / 4184 J/kcal ≈ 13.61 kcal.

So 57 kJ ≈ 13.61 kcal. So each mole of H+ contributes approx -13.6 kcal.

Wait, but the options list B as -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.8 kJ (since 11.42 kcal *4.184 kJ/kcal ≈ 47.8 kJ). Hmm, but we have 0.2 moles reacting. So 0.2 * 13.6 kcal = 2.72 kcal. Wait, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I had the wrong approach earlier.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid, not per mole of H+.

Wait, for a monoprotic acid, like HCl, the enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of HCl. For H2SO4, which is diprotic, but in the first dissociation is strong. The second H+ is weaker, but when neutralizing, both are available.

But wait, in the first neutralization (monobasic), the H+ from H2SO4 is as strong as HCl, but the second H+ is weaker. So for the first mole of H2SO4, the enthalpy is about -57 kJ, but the second (since it's a weaker acid) might have a different value. Wait, no, because for H2SO4, the first H+ is very strong, the second is also strong but not as much. So I think the enthalpy for the first H+ is around -57 kJ, and the second is about -13.7 kJ (since the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 (second H+) is about half, but not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps the standard enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4's first H+ is about -57 kJ/mol, and the second is approximately -13.7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is simplified, assuming that all H+ ions contribute equally, regardless of the source. So each mole of H+ gives -57 kJ.

So, in our case, the total moles of H+ from HCl is 0.1, and from H2SO4 is 0.18. So 0.28 moles. But the OH- is 0.2 moles. So only 0.2 moles of H+ will neutralize.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, there's option D) -16.0 kJ, but that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 * 4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ? No, that's not correct. Wait, no, wait: if the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ, and the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.5 kJ, which is not matching.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the units. Oh wait, the problem might be using calories instead of kilojoules.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol, which is about -13.6 kcal/mol (since 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.6).

So, per mole of H+ reacting, it's -13.6 kcal.

In our problem, 0.2 moles of H+ react. So 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. Which is option A.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because earlier I thought the enthalpy was per mole of H+. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

But earlier when I thought in kJ, I had -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. Because 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J, which is 11,400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

Wait, that makes sense. So the total enthalpy is -2.72 kcal.

So that's option A.

But wait, another thought: when calculating the neutralization enthalpy, perhaps it's per mole of reaction, regardless of H+ ions. So for the overall reaction, how many moles of H+ are involved?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the total enthalpy change for the reaction, regardless of the source. Let me think about the overall reaction equation.

Wait, the problem is mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So, the reaction is the sum of each acid reacting with the base.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will react with both HCl and H2SO4.

Hmm, perhaps I should write the balanced equations.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + H2O.

Wait, but let me balance these.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Because Ba(OH)2 has two OH^- ions. Each HCl provides one H+. So for Ba(OH)2, which has two OH^-, you need two H+ (from two HCl molecules) to neutralize both OH^-.

So the reaction is:

2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 is diprotic. So each H2SO4 can provide two H+ ions. So when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, each Ba(OH)2 (which provides two OH^-) can react with one H2SO4.

Wait, no. Because H2SO4 gives two H+, and Ba(OH)2 gives two OH^-. So the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, let me check that. H2SO4 is H+ rich. Each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+, and Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^-.

So 2 H+ + 2 OH^- → 2 H2O. So the equation is:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of H2SO4 neutralizes one mole of Ba(OH)2.

Now, considering the moles of each reactant.

Moles of HCl: 0.1 mol.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

The reactions would be:

1) HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2 in a 2:1 ratio (from the equation 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → ...).

So each mole of Ba(OH)2 requires 2 moles of HCl.

So, how much HCl is needed per mole of Ba(OH)2? 2 moles.

Available HCl: 0.1 mol.

So, for 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2, we need 0.2 mol HCl.

But we only have 0.1 mol HCl. So HCl is the limiting reagent here for this reaction.

So, all 0.1 mol HCl reacts, requiring 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 (since 2 HCl :1 Ba(OH)2).

So, Ba(OH)2 used: 0.05 mol. Remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Now, the remaining Ba(OH)2 (0.05 mol) will react with H2SO4.

The reaction is 1:1 (H2SO4 : Ba(OH)2).

So, moles of H2SO4 needed: 0.05 mol.

We have 0.09 mol H2SO4. So after reaction, remaining H2SO4: 0.09 -0.05 = 0.04 mol.

Now, in this scenario, after both reactions, we have:

HCl: 0 (all used).

Ba(OH)2: 0.05 mol remaining.

H2SO4: 0.04 mol remaining.

Wait, no, because when H2SO4 reacts, it's a 1:1 ratio. So 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 reacts with 0.05 mol H2SO4.

So H2SO4 left is 0.09 -0.05=0.04 mol.

So the neutralization involves:

1) 0.1 mol HCl reacting with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.05 mol BaCl2 and 0.1 mol H2O.

2) 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 reacting with 0.05 mol H2SO4, producing 0.05 mol BaSO4 and 0.1 mol H2O.

So total moles of H+ neutralized are 0.1 (from HCl) + (0.05 * 2) (from H2SO4) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 moles. Which matches our earlier calculation.

Each mole of H+ contributes about -57 kJ (or -13.6 kcal). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given as -57 kJ per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. So for HCl, each mole contributes -57 kJ, and for H2SO4, each mole contributes 2 * (-57 kJ) = -114 kJ.

Wait, but that would be a different approach. So in this case, let's recalculate.

HCl: 0.1 moles. Each mole → -57 kJ. So 0.1 * (-57) = -5.7 kJ.

H2SO4: 0.05 moles (since it only reacted 0.05 moles, as per the reaction above). Each mole contributes -114 kJ. So 0.05 * (-114) = -5.7 kJ.

Total enthalpy change: -5.7 + (-5.7) = -11.4 kJ.

Again, same result.

But the options don't have -11.4 kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ.

Hmm, maybe the problem is using a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Sometimes, the value is given as -57 kJ per mole of H+ for the first H+ and -13.6 kJ for the second H+ (since the second H+ in H2SO4 is less strong). But I'm not sure.

Wait, no. For the second H+ in H2SO4, the enthalpy of neutralization is about -13.7 kJ per mole. So if the reaction uses 0.05 moles of H2SO4, that's 0.1 moles of H+ (since each H2SO4 gives 2 H+). So the first 0.05 from HCl (each H+ is -57) and 0.1 from H2SO4 (each H+ is -57 for the first and -13.7 for the second).

Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the total neutralization is 0.2 moles of H+ (from HCl and H2SO4), each contributing -57 kJ. So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -26.8 kcal (because 11.4 *4.184 ≈ 47.8 kJ, which is about 11.42 kcal). Wait, no. Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11.4 * (1/4.184) ≈ 2.72 kcal.

Wait, so 0.2 moles of H+ → 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ → which is -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that would be the answer.

But wait, the problem is asking for the enthalpy of neutralization when all three are mixed. So the total is -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available.

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl dissociates completely, contributing 1 H⁺ per molecule.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of HCl} = 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   Thus, moles of H⁺ from HCl = 0.1 mol.

2. **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a strong acid, with the first dissociation being complete and the second dissociation also significant for neutralization. Each molecule of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 H⁺ ions.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   Thus, moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Total moles of H⁺**:  
   \[
   \text{Total H⁺} = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, contributing 2 OH⁻ ions per molecule.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   Thus, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Limiting reagent**:  
   The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \). Since there are 0.28 moles of H⁺ and 0.2 moles of OH⁻, OH⁻ is the limiting reagent. Only 0.2 moles of H⁺ will react with 0.2 moles of OH⁻.

6. **Enthalpy of neutralization**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺.  
   \[
   \text{Enthalpy change} = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
   \]  
   Converting to kilocalories (1 kJ = 0.239 kcal):  
   \[
   -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
   \]

7. **Final answer**:  
   The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to option A.

**Answer: A**
