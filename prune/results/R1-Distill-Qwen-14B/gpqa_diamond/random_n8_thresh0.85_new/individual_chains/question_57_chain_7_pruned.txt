Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, the phase shifts are given, and I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by something involving the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l +1) (δ_l) P_l(cosθ) ), where δ_l are the phase shifts, P_l are the Legendre polynomials, and k is the wave number. But wait, because in this case, the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0 degrees.

Wait, no, the incident beam direction is usually along the z-axis, so θ=0, right? So I need to evaluate f(0) and find its imaginary part. Also, since the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4, I guess we only consider the given δ0 to δ4.

But wait, what's the general form of the scattering amplitude? I think it's f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} - 1] P_l(cosθ) ). Because the phase shift contributes as e^{2iδ_l}, and subtracting 1 gives the exponential part. Then, the amplitude is separated into real and imaginary parts based on that.

Since we're interested in the imaginary part, I should focus on the imaginary components of each term. The imaginary part of e^{2iδ_l} is sin(2δ_l), because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So the imaginary part of each term would be (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ) / k.

Wait, but only the terms where P_l(1) is non-zero contribute at θ=0. Because cos0=1, and P_l(1)=1 for all l. Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1 for any l. So each term in the sum contributes when l is considered.

So for each given δ_l, I need to compute (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l) and sum them all, then multiply by 1/k.

Wait, no, the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l) multiplied by P_l(1), which is 1. So the imaginary part is (1/k) * Σ ( (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) for l=0 to 4.

But what's k? Oh, k is the wave number, which is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ. Wait, the electrons have energy 50 MeV. Hmm, but wait, for non-relativistic particles, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), but electrons at 50 MeV are actually relativistic. Oh, but I think the problem expects me to use the non-relativistic formula for k. Let me think: the energy E is given as 50 MeV. So I need to compute
