Okay, let's see. I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, an electron's state is given, and I need to calculate probabilities and the average value of a certain operator. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

So, the state is |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's not necessarily normalized, right? So first thing I should probably do is normalize this state because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes, and without normalization, the probabilities won't add up to 1.

The given state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin. So, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). To find the normalization factor, I'll compute the inner product of the state with itself.

Calculating the normalization factor:
The state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2-i).

The squared magnitude for a is |a|^2 = (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2.
Similarly, |b|^2 = (2-i)(2+i) = 4 +1 =5.
The cross terms: a*b* is (1+i)(2-i) and b*a* is (2-i)(1-i). But since they're cross terms, they'll have a factor of 2 in the inner product. Wait, no, when you compute |a + b|^2, it's a*a† + a*b† + b*a† + b*b†. Wait, no, more accurately, |alpha|^2 = a a* + b b* + a b† + b a†.

Wait, maybe I should just compute the inner product correctly. Let me write it out:

<alpha|alpha> = |a|^2 + |b|^2 + a*b† + b*a†.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, |alpha> is a|up> + b|down>, so <alpha| is a* <up| + b* <down|.

So <alpha|alpha> = a* a <up|up> + a* b <up|down> + b* a <down|up> + b* b <down|down>.

Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner products are zero when different and 1 when same. So this simplifies to |a|^2 + |b|^2.

So |a|^2 is |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. |b|^2 is |2 -i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total is 2+5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator whose matrix is A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's an off-diagonal matrix. Let me think about the dimensions. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because it's spin-1/2), the states are |up> and |down>, so i and j can be 1 and 2. So A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2.

So matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. Hmm, that's interesting. So this operator is ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix, except with a factor of 1/2? Wait, the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if I have [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], that's (ħ/2) * X, where X is the Pauli matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is proportional to sigma_x. So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator.

Wait, but the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of operator A. So, the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, right? Because the Pauli X operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, or something like that.

So if I can find the eigenstates of A, I can express the state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator A has eigenvalues ±ħ/2? Wait no, let me think. The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2
