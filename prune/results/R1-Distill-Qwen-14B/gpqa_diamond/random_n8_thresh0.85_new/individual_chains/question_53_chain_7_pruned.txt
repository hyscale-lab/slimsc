Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a try. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, a six-membered ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), and their IR typically shows strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹. So that's one clue.

Now, the 1H NMR spectrum gives some more details. There are six signals in total. Let's break down what each part means.

First, two signals correspond to aromatic protons. Since the ring is di-substituted, the substituents can be in positions that create different environments for the aromatic hydrogens. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic Hs might split into two sets due to symmetry. Or maybe they're meta or ortho, but either way, two signals imply that the protons are in two different environments with different chemical shifts.

Next, there are two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are those attached to double bonds, like in an alkene group. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet suggests that each proton is coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets might mean each proton is splitting into four peaks due to coupling with two sets of protons. Wait, maybe it's a more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is adjacent to some substituents which cause splitting. Maybe it's part of an ester group, like an ethyl ester?

Then, there are two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. So there are two sets of methyl groups. Since there are two signals, these methyl groups are in different environments, meaning they're attached to different parts of the molecule. No signals for –CH2 groups, so there are no methylene groups in the structure. That's interesting.

Putting it all together, the molecule has an aromatic ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester group (from the IR), and possibly some other groups that contribute to the NMR signals. The two methyl groups could be part of the ester, maybe as an ethyl ester (O-CO-O-ethyl), but wait, an ethyl ester would have a CH2CH3 group, which would have its own signals. But in the NMR, there are no CH2 signals, so maybe it's not an ethyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is part of a benzyl group or something else without CH2.

Wait, the other substituent on the ring might be something like a vinyl group. Like a styrene group (vinyl benzene) or something similar. But let's think: the vinyl-H signals would come from a group like CH2=CH-. But in that case, each proton on the CH2 would be a quartet if coupled with each other, but the problem says one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Maybe it's a different arrangement, like a substituted vinyl group.

Let me think about the substituents. The aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester group (O-CO-O-R), and the other might be a vinyl group or another group that includes CH3 groups.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the ester is part of a larger substituent. For example, maybe the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, but that might not explain the vinyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester group and an acetyl group or something similar. No, acetyl is a carbonyl too but doesn't have the ester oxygen.

Wait, the two substituents on the ring would influence the NMR signals. Let's try to visualize the structure.

So, the aromatic ring is 6-membered, and it's di-substituted. Let's assume the substituents are at the para positions for maximum symmetry, but wait, if they're para, the aromatic protons might be in two sets (like two doublets), which would fit the two aromatic signals. Or perhaps they're in the ortho and para positions relative to each other, leading to different environments.

But the key is to figure out the structure that fits all the NMR and IR data.

The presence of an ester group suggests that the molecule has a structure where an oxygen is connected to a carbonyl, which is connected to an OR group. For example, the substituent could be a carbonyloxy group attached to an R group, like O-CO-O-R.

But the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So perhaps the ester is something like O-CO-OCH2CH3 (ethyl ester), but wait, that would have a –O–CO–O–CH2CH3 group. Then the ethyl group would have a CH3 at the end. But in the NMR, the ethyl group would show a triplet for the CH2 and a quartet for the CH3. But the problem states that there are no CH2 signals. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is a methyl ester, like O-CO-OCH3. But then there would be only one CH3 group, but the problem says two. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group and another group that has two CH3. Let me think: if one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other is a vinyl group, but where are the CH3 groups?

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R, where R is a methyl group), but that again would only give one CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a methyl group. But then, the NMR would show more signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are a vinyl group and another group that has two methyl groups.

Wait, another thought: maybe the substituents are an ester group and a propenyl group (like CH2CH2CH3?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again.

Six signals:

- 2 aromatic H
- 2 vinyl H (one doublet, one doublet of quartets)
- 2 CH3 groups

So, two vinyl H's and two CH3. So perhaps there are two different methyl groups in the molecule.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group, and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. Like, perhaps, a phenyl group attached to a vinyl methyl ester or something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a di-substituted benzene ring where one substituent is an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a methyl group. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is more complex. Another possibility is that the substituent is a carbonyl group, like an acetyl group, but that wouldn't account for the ester's IR.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group (O-CO-O-R) and a vinyl group attached to another oxygen, like a methoxy group. Wait, but that would lead to more signals.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group (like an ester) and another group that has a vinyl and a methyl group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach this systematically.

First, the molecular formula options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O
