Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers have limited time, so they want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets are already detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. They also have circular orbits. 

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. However, both host stars have the same radii. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but that doesn't change the radius, so maybe it's a main sequence star compared to a slightly larger one? Or wait, no, the radii are same. So, same size stars, but different masses.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The options give different ratios, so I need to calculate the probability for each.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I think is P = (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / (a_planet / R_star)), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the transit probability is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a_p), but that seems a bit off. Let me think again.

No, wait. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet to the area of the star, multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. But wait, that's not exactly right. The exact probability formula for a transit is P = (R_p / R_s) * ( (R_s) / (a_p) ) ), because the chance depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit relative to the star's size. Or wait, maybe it's P = (R_p / R_s) * (R_s / a_p) * something else.

Wait, I might be confusing some terms. Let me try to recall. The probability of a transit
