Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed (v_rel) and the total energy (E). The options are A to D.

First, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. If you're in one frame and another object is moving, you can't just subtract their speeds directly. I think you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula, if I recall correctly, is:

v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²))

Wait, wait, let me think. Oh right, because from the perspective of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), the second one is moving at 0.5c. So I need to compute the relative speed from the first astronaut's frame.

Wait, no, actually, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Since B is moving slower than A, the relative speed would be (0.6c -0.5c) divided by some factor due to relativity.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because in relativity, you can't just subtract the velocities. Let me get the formula right. The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²))

Where u is the velocity of the object as measured in the original frame (S), and v is the velocity of the frame S' (which is moving at velocity v relative to S). So in this case, the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) at 0.5c. So from the frame of the first astronaut, the velocity of the second is (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify the frames. Let
