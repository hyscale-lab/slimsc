Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Alright, I'll read the question again and see what it's asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, do their masses matter for this problem? The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. Maybe the masses are a red herring, or perhaps they relate to the star's evolution, but the question seems more about elemental abundances.

The data given are the elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width method. The numbers are in dex, which means decimal exponents. The values given are:

For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) or maybe (n_Si,2 / n_Si,1)? The wording says "ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2", which I think is Star_1 divided by Star_2.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So let me calculate the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H].

Wait, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. Since for the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5, that means log(nFe/nH)_sun = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH)_sun is 7 -12 = -5.

Wait, but let me think: the notation is [X/Y]_star = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So Star_1 has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun, meaning [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So nFe,1 / nH,1 = nFe, sun / nH, sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → log(nMg/nH)_2 = log(nMg/nH)_sun. So nMg,2/nH,2 = nMg,sun/nH,sun.

Now, the [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3. So log(nSi,1/(nFe,1)) = log(nSi,sun/nFe,sun) +0.3.

Since for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, nFe,1/nH,1 = nFe,sun/nH,sun. So nFe,1 = (nFe,sun / nH,sun) * nH,1.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of the sun's values.

Let me start by calculating what each element's abundance is in each star.

First, the Sun:

nFe/nH = 10^( (7.5) - 12 ) =10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

nMg/nH =10^(7 -12) =10^(-5) = 1e-5.

But wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5. So log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5. Same for Mg: log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Now, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe,1/nH,1 = nFe,sun/nH,sun. So same as the Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi, sun/nFe, sun) +0.3.

What's nSi, sun /nFe, sun? Let me see. In the Sun, [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe)_sun. Wait, but the problem doesn't give [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Hmm, maybe I can express Si in terms of Mg or something else.

Wait, but perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun using the given data for Star_2?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] isn't provided, but I might need to make some assumptions about the solar composition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of hydrogen, since [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

But nFe,1 = nFe_sun * (nH,1 / nH_sun) → because [Fe/H]
