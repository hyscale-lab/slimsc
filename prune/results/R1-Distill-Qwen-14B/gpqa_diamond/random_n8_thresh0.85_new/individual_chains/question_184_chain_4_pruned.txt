Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which reaction sequence will give me the desired product. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target compound. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, numbering might be a bit tricky here. Let's imagine the benzene ring positions: when numbering, the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. Or maybe I should think of it as positions 1, 2, and 3 in a specific arrangement.

Wait, actually, the numbering would probably be such that the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, but I need to visualize that. Let me draw it mentally: the ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at position 3 (since 3 is meta to 1?), and tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the substituents as 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So on the benzene ring, substituents are in the ortho, meta positions relative to each other.

So the synthesis starts with benzene. We need to add these substituents in the correct order. The key here is the directing effects of each substituent and the order of addition.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the directing effect of a substituent determines where the next substituent will attach. Electron-donating groups (like OCH2CH3, ethoxy) are ortho/para directors, while electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) are meta directors.

But wait, if we have multiple substituents, the order in which they are added will influence where the next one goes. So let's think about the steps needed.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's consider their positions. If we have ethoxy (OCH2CH3) at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2, then how do they arrange?

Wait, maybe it's 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. That would mean the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is 1-nitro, 2-ethoxy, 3-tert-butyl, but that depends on the order of substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that each new substituent is added based on the directing effects of the existing ones.

I think the problem requires adding the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position, considering the directing effects of the existing groups.

Let me think about the substituents:

- tert-butyl is a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group, an electron donor via +I effect). It's an ortho/para director.

- Ethoxy is also an activating group (electron-donating via lone pairs) and is an ortho/para director.

- Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

So, when adding substituents, if I add a meta-directing group after an ortho/para director, the next group might go into a specific position.

Wait, but if I have multiple substituents, the order of addition matters. Let's think: perhaps the nitro group is added first, but nitro is meta-directing, which might complicate adding the other groups. Alternatively, adding the tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, perhaps it's better to add the nitro group last because once nitro is present, it directs meta, and perhaps we've already placed the other groups in positions where the nitro can be added correctly.

Wait, but let's think about each possible option and see which sequence makes sense.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering from the ethoxy (position 1), the substituents are at positions 2 (tert-butyl) and 3 (nitro). Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is at position 3 relative to ethoxy, making it meta.

Wait, perhaps I should number the ring with ethoxy in position 1. Then, the tert-butyl is in position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro is in position 3 (meta to ethoxy and perhaps adjacent to tert-butyl? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is in the meta position relative to ethoxy, making it position 3, and tert-butyl is in position 2, which is ortho to ethoxy and adjacent to nitro.

Hmm, maybe that's the arrangement.

So, the substituents would be:

Position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH3)

Position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3)

Position 3: nitro (NO2)

So, the order of addition would need to place each group in the correct position, considering the directing effects.

Let me think about the possible reaction sequences.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each has a sequence of reactions, and I need to figure out which one would give the correct substituents in the right positions.

Let's consider each option.

Option A:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts alkylation)

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration)

iii) SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation)

iv) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization)

v) dilute H2SO4 (heating for decomposition?)

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat (hydrolysis?)

vii) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxy group, maybe via Williamson)

viii) Fe/HCl (Fe in HCl? Maybe acid workup or something else.)

ix) HNO3/H2SO4 (another nitration?)

Wait, but the product needs three substituents, so the reactions should add each substituent.

Wait, but let's think: starting with benzene.

First step in option A is Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So that adds a tert-butyl group to benzene. The t-butyl is a strong activating group, ortho/para director.

Then nitration (ii) would add nitro group. Since the ring is activated, the nitration would occur. Where? The tert-butyl directs ortho and para. So nitro could go ortho or para to t-butyl. Let's say the nitro is added para to t-butyl. Then, after that, other steps.

But then step iii is sulfonation. Sulfonic acid groups are strong deactivating, meta directors. So adding a sulfonic acid group would direct incoming substituents to meta positions. But wait, the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So why would sulfonation be a step? Unless maybe it's part of some protection or directing.

But the target has ethoxy, not sulfonic acid. So perhaps option A is incorrect because it introduces a sulfonic acid group which isn't part of the target.

Alternatively, maybe the sulfonation is part of
