Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds can rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms—usually carbons—bonded to four different groups. Right, so the question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit this kind of isomerism.

The question lists four compounds (1 to 4), and I need to figure out which ones show optical isomerism. The options are groups A to D, each containing some numbers.

Let me take each compound one by one.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, that's a mouthful. So, it's a biphenyl structure with substituents. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'. The structure—biphenyl rings connected with single bonds. Wait, but are there any chiral centers here? Each of the substituents is in specific positions. Let's think about the connectivity. Each ring is connected at 1 and 1', so the substituents are on 2 and 2', and 6 and 6'. Now, are any of the carbon atoms attached to four different groups? For the ester groups, the oxygen is connected to a methyl and the carbonyl. But the carbons in the ester (like the one attached to OMe) would have three substituents: the ester oxygen, the carbonyl, and two others? Wait, no—each ester group is OMe. The carbonyl is at the center. Wait, perhaps the biphenyl itself. The central carbon where the two rings are connected—since it's a biphenyl, the connecting carbon is single-bonded. So, if the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6. Are there any chiral centers in the biphenyl part? The substituents are on the same ring, so perhaps the central carbon is connected to two rings and two substituents? Wait, no, each ring is attached to the central carbon. So, the central carbon (the one connecting the two rings) is bonded to two phenyl groups and two more substituents (the nitro and carboxylate groups). Wait, no. Let me visualize. The central carbon (position 1 and 1') is connected to two phenyl rings (maybe each ring is attached to the central carbon in the biphenyl structure). So, each ring is attached to the central carbon. Now, the substituents on the rings: 6 and 6' have nitro groups, 2 and 2' have ester groups. So, perhaps the central carbon is connected to two identical phenyl groups, a nitro group, and a carboxylate group? Wait, no. Each substituent is on each ring. So the central carbon is attached to two benzene rings, each of which has substituents. But that doesn't mean the central carbon is a chiral center. Because the two phenyl rings are identical, so if the substituents on each ring are the same? Wait, in this compound, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at positions 6 and 2, respectively. So each ring is symmetric in that sense. So, the central carbon (where the two rings are connected) would be bonded to two identical phenyl groups, a nitro group, and a carboxylate group? Wait, no, each ring is connected to the central carbon. So, the central carbon is bonded to two phenyl rings (each with substituents), and then the substituents on each phenyl ring. Wait, no—each phenyl ring is connected to the central carbon and has its own substituents. So the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, each with their own substituents. Are the substituents on each phenyl ring in such a way that the groups attached to the central carbon are all different? Let me think: the central carbon is connected
