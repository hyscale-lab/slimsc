Okay, so I'm looking at this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I know that these are the standard basis states for the spin-1/2 system.

Next, we have an operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij. The rule is that Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, that would make the diagonal elements zero and the off-diagonal elements hbar/2. So the matrix looks like this:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Oh, right, because when i≠j, Aij is hbar/2, else zero.

The question asks us to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The norm squared is the inner product of the state with itself.

Calculating the inner product: (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i).

Wait, because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. So the inner product would be (1+i)(1-i)*1 + (2-i)(2+i)*1.

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2-i)(2+i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7). Therefore, the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) because it's proportional to that.

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator's matrix is given as A. Since the matrix is 2x2 with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere, that looks familiar. I think this operator is related to the Pauli matrices. Let me recall: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A would be (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X has 1s on the off-diagonal, and zeros on diagonal, so scaling by hbar/2 gives the matrix for A.

Yes, so A = (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the operator A as well, since A is just a scalar multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. But wait, wait, no: actually, the eigenstates for σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) with eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) with eigenvalue -1. So, because A is (hbar/2)σ_x, the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1). So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> with eigenvalues
