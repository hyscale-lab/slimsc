Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but let me try to think it through. The problem is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

Hmm, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second, in quantum mechanics, the wave function has to satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the probability of finding the particle somewhere has to be normalized, meaning the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, the problem states that when we measure the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 and x > 3. So that means the wave function must be zero outside this interval, but wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, because in the given wave function, is it zero outside 1 to 3? Or does the wave function as given apply only within x=1 to x=3? Oh, the problem says "in a part of space where it can exist", so I think the wave function is zero outside that part. So the given expression is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. So the absolute square would be the square of the modulus. Let me recall, for a complex number z = z_real + z_imag * i, the modulus squared is z_real^2 + z_imag^2.

So the wave function ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = A - Bi, where A is a real term (a/sqrt(1+x)) and B is 0.5.

Wait, but wait, if the wave function is given only between x=1 and x=3, then the normalization integral should be from x=1 to x=3. Because outside, the wave function is zero, which doesn't contribute to the integral.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². 

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i.

The modulus squared is (a / sqrt(1+x)) )^2 + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Therefore, the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

So let's split the integral into two parts:

Integral [ a²/(1+x) ] dx from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), and ln(2) is ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the sum of both integrals is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. But if the wave function is ψ(x) = A(x) + B(x)i, then the modulus squared is |A(x)|² + |B(x)|². In this case, A(x) is a real function (a/sqrt(1+x)), and B(x) is 0.5. So the modulus squared is [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5)^2. Which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but hold on. Is B(x) a constant here? Because in the given wave function, it's -0.5i, which suggests that the imaginary part is a constant, 0.5 (since i is sqrt(-1)). So B(x) is 0.5 for all x in 1 to 3, and zero outside. So yes, the modulus squared is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Putting it all together, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So solving for a²: a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is the square root of that. Sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the probability density is the modulus squared of the wave function:
