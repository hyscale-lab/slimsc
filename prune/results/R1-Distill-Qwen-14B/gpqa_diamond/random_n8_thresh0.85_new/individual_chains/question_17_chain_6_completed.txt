Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA complexes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that has 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex properly. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects the calculations. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Wait, I remember that the formation constant (or stability constant) K is a measure of how much the metal and EDTA will form the complex. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. So, in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is very stable because K is 5e10, which is a big number.

Since the solution is stoichiometric, that means the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1. So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I think the formula for the complex is something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4− ion.

I think the dissociation of the complex can be written as:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The formation constant K is given by [Ca²+][Y^4−]/[CaY²−], right? Oh wait, wait. Let me get that formula right. The formation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− → CaEDTA²− 

So the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Oh, right, that's the correct expression. So Kf = [complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But in this problem, we're dealing with the dissociation of the complex. So the reverse of the formation, meaning K for the dissociation would be 1/Kf. Because if K for forming the complex is Kf, then Kd (dissociation) is 1/Kf.

Wait, but in the problem statement, they probably give us the K for the complex as K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5e10. So that's Kf, the formation constant.

So when the complex dissociates, the K for that reverse reaction is Kd = 1/(Kf) = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

But wait, in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. When it dissociates, some of it breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

Let me denote the change. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ and Y^4− produced from the dissociation. So:

At equilibrium:
[CaY²−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since Kd is small, x will be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

Wait, but the EDTA in solution can come from the dissociation of the complex, right? But if the solution is stoichiometric, does that mean the initial EDTA is all in the complex? Or is there free EDTA?

Wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think that implies that initially, all the EDTA is in the complex. Because stoichiometric ratio is 1:1. So if the complex is 0.02 M, then the free EDTA would be very low, but I'll have to see.

So the dissociation equation is:

CaY²− ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4−

The Kd is ( [Ca²+][Y^4−] ) / [CaY²−] ) = 2e-11.

But since Kd is very small, the dissociation will be minimal, so x is much smaller than 0.02, so [CaY²−] ≈ 0.02 M.

So plugging into Kd:

x * x / 0.02 = 2e-11

Which is x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, so square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is ~6.32e-7.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That's one of the choices.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. Another approach: the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it's in equilibrium with Ca²+ and EDTA.

So, K = [Ca²+][EDTA] / [CaY^2-]

We can rearrange this to [Ca²+] = K * [CaY^2-] / [EDTA]

But wait, in the problem, the complex is 0.02 M, but what about the EDTA? Well, in the solution, the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. So, [EDTA] = x, and [Ca²+] = x. So [Ca²+] = sqrt( K * [CaY^2-] )

Wait, no, let me think again. K is 5e10 for the formation. So for the dissociation, Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, [Ca²+][EDTA] = Kd * [CaY^2−]

Assuming [Ca²+] = [EDTA] = x, and [CaY^2−] = 0.02.

So x^2 = Kd * 0.02

x^2 = (2e-11)(0.02) = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7.

Yes, that's correct. So the concentration of Ca²+ is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) are equal, denoted as \( x \), and the concentration of the complex \(\text{CaY}^{2-}\) is approximately \( 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since \( K_d \) is very small, the dissociation is minimal). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting \( [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x \) and \( [\text{CaY}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \), we get:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
