Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and with multiple bridgehead carbons. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons.

First step: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with a base, they usually undergo elimination reactions, like E2. Wait, but since it's a dihalide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. So two elimination steps here, perhaps leading to the formation of a diene or an alkyne?

Wait, but wait, the product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. Hmm, what functional groups absorb around 1720? That's usually a carbonyl, like ketone or ester or maybe an aldehyde. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, which isn't here. Let me think, maybe a ketone. But wait, the product is formed from elimination of HBr from dibromide. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. If there are two bromines, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, but in adamantane, which is a bridge structure, eliminating two HBr molecules would form two double bonds? No, wait, that would require each elimination. Oh wait, no, each elimination forms one double bond. So starting with two bromines, perhaps two eliminations happen, forming two double bonds. But wait, if each bromine is on a bridgehead, maybe they're adjacent? Let me visualize adamantane. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads, perhaps.

So when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and each elimination forms a double bond. But wait, each elimination would form a double bond, so maybe the product is a diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic compound with some conjugated double bonds.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. That's confusing. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Wait, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. But KOH is not a good nucleophile for substitution in such rigid structures. Wait, but maybe it's an epoxide formation? No, that usually involves peracids. Or maybe a Hofmann elimination, but that's more for amines.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't a diene. Let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That could be an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide, but wait, no, because epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group. If it's a ketone, the protons would be adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, wait, no, the H at 4.79 would be adjacent to something electronegative. Maybe it's an ether? Or perhaps it's a geminal diol, but that would have a different NMR.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If it's elimination, each Br could be removed with H from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond. But if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a double bond. Wait, but if they're on opposite bridgeheads, perhaps they're not adjacent. So maybe each Br is on a different bridgehead, and elimination would form two double bonds in a conjugated system. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann-type elimination, but that's more for esters.

Wait, maybe the product is a cycloalkene. Let me think: KOH could cause each Br to leave, and each elimination would create a double bond. But if the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene. But adamantane is highly strained (not really, adamantane is a diamondoid, so it's actually quite rigid and not as strained as, say, cyclopropane), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. How could elimination of HBr from a dibromide lead to a carbonyl? Oh wait, maybe it's a oxidation? No, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates something else.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but as I thought earlier, that doesn't fit the IR. Or maybe it's a ketone. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but I'm stuck on the IR.

Wait another angle: maybe the product is bromoalkene? No, but the IR would show a different peak. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound with a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe the elimination leads to a ketone. Let me think: perhaps each elimination forms a double bond, but maybe the structure rearranges to form a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to a conjugated diene. But why the IR would show a carbonyl? Unless there's an oxidation step, but KOH doesn't oxidize.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Wait, but how would elimination of HBr from a dibromide lead to a diketone? That doesn't seem straightforward.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexanone derivative. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone because of some kind of ring-opening. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that's when two hydroxyl groups are on the same carbon, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the IR. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, likely a ketone or an ester. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). 4.79 is a bit upfield for an aromatic proton, but more likely, this is adjacent to an electronegative atom. For a ketone, the adjacent CH2 would be around 2.1-2.5 ppm, but here, 4.79 is higher. That suggests perhaps an ether or an ester.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a diketone. So two carbonyl groups. But then the NMR would show some peaks for the carbonyl protons, but wait, ketones don't have protons. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with adjacent protons.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexenone. Let's say that after elimination, the structure becomes a cyclohexenone derivative. Then, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be around 2.1-2.5 ppm. But in the NMR, the 4.79 peak is higher. So not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide, but the IR doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows 2H at 4.79. Maybe these are two protons on an oxygen-bearing group, like an OCH2O group in an epoxide. But the coupling would look different.

Wait, maybe KOH is causing the formation of a ketone via some kind of elimination and rearrangement. Let me think: perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a double bond, but with some ring opening that forms a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more of a substitution. Wait, another possibility: if the base (KOH) abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond, but with two such eliminations, maybe forming a conjugated diene. But then the IR doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Brs on bridgeheads. Eliminating both could form a structure where a ring is opened, leading to a ketone. For example, maybe the bridge between the two bridgeheads breaks, forming a carbonyl group. But I'm not exactly visualizing that.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone, but that would require two carbonyl groups, which I don't see in the NMR.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a bridgehead diol. But that would require substitution, which is unlikely with KOH. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxide, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track. Let me think about the IR peak again. 1720 cm-1 is definitely a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

Wait, could it be a ketone formed via some kind of rearrangement after elimination? Like a pinacol rearrangement? But pinacol rearrangement is for 1,2-diols eliminating water to form ketones. Not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, but the reaction is with KOH, which is a base. So perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, and then that double bond undergoes some further reaction, like oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe the product is a conjugated diene that is then ozonized later, but that's in a later step.

Wait, the first step's product isn't ozonized yet; that's step three.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the NMR data.

At 4.79 ppm, a doublet for 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. For example, an epoxide's CH2 would be around 3-4 ppm, so 4.79 is a bit high for that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl adjacent CH2. For example, in a ketone, the adjacent CH2 would be around 2.2-2.5 ppm. But 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's another scenario.

Wait, maybe the 4.79 is a CH2 connected to an oxygen with another group. For example, an ether's CH2 would be around 3-4.5 ppm. So 4.79 is possible if the group is more electronegative, but not sure.

Wait, maybe the product is an alcohol. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Wait, unless it's a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the product is a conjugated diene, but the IR doesn't match. So I'm stuck on the first step. Let me try to think of the product structure.

Wait, maybe the heating with KOH leads to the formation of adamantane-1,3-diol. But no, that would be substitution, which is unlikely as adamantane is not very reactive. Plus, the IR doesn't show OH stretch, but the product is a solid, maybe it's an oxide.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a bicyclic ether, like a diepoxide, but that again doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let me imagine that the elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane leads to a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, maybe each elimination forms a carbonyl. But that doesn't make sense, because elimination of HBr from a dibromide would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Unless there's a rearrangement. For example, perhaps one elimination forms a double bond, and the other leads to a carbonyl via some kind of peroxide effect, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. But that usually involves carbocation shifts. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexenone. For example, if two adjacent Brs are eliminated, forming a double bond, and then some kind of ring contraction or expansion forms a carbonyl.

I think I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should think about the subsequent steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But the substrate here is product 1, which has a carbonyl group. So perhaps product 1 is an acyl chloride, but no, because the first step was with KOH, which would not form an acyl chloride. Alternatively, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed via some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 2 is then subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, let me think again. Product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound. When product 1 is treated with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Friedel-Crafts acylation, but product 1 would need to be an acyl chloride, which it isn't. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an acylium ion or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide could form a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: product 1 could be a diene. Then, when treated with a Lewis acid like Al isopropoxide, perhaps it forms a dienol ether or undergoes some cycloaddition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: let's think about the IR and NMR of product 1 again. The IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl. The NMR shows a 2H at 4.79. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. The 4.79 ppm could be the vinylic protons. For example, in a conjugated dienone, the vinylic protons are around 5-6 ppm. Hmm, but 4.79 is lower than that. Maybe it's an allylic position.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a structure like CH2-C(O)-R, the CH2 protons would be around 2.5 ppm. But wait, the 4.79 is higher, so maybe it's an OCH2 group. Like in an ester: OCH2COOR or something, but then the ester carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1. So that fits the IR.

Ah! So if product 1 is an ester, then the IR makes sense. Let me think: how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane react with KOH to form an ester? Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's a diketone. Let's imagine product 1 is a diketone, with two carbonyl groups. Then the NMR would have some peaks corresponding to that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single carbonyl group. Let me think of the NMR again. The 4.79 ppm is a doublet for 2H. Maybe these are the protons adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps in a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. So, for example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-O-R', but that's more like an ester. Alternatively, R-CO-CH2-CH2-R.

Wait, but if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R, the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2.3-2.5 ppm, which doesn't match the 4.79 peak. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 peak is a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. For example, an epoxide ring would have CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen, which would have protons around 3-4 ppm. So 4.79 is a bit high for that.

Wait, another structure: maybe the product is a benzene ring with a ketone substituent and some substituents. But I don't see how the starting material would lead to that.

Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the reaction conditions again.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH in excess. KOH is a strong base. So it's likely an elimination reaction. So from each Br, an H is abstracted, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since there are two Brs, perhaps two double bonds form, making a diene.

Wait, but dienes would show different NMR and IR. The IR would show C=C absorption around 1650 cm-1, but the problem says the IR has a peak at 1720, which is higher, pointing to a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe the product is an enone, a conjugated dienone. So a conjugated diene with a ketone. That would explain the 1720 cm-1 peak. The NMR would then show the protons adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps as a doublet.

Wait, for an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone), the vinylic protons would be around 5-6 ppm, but the 4.79 is a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted double bond, so the protons are less deshielded.

Alternatively, maybe the structure isn't an enone but a cyclic ketone with a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is cyclohexenone. Then, NMR would show a triplet or something for the CH2 groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a bridged ketone, like bicyclo structure with a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to draw the structure based on the NMR.

The NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely from methyl or methylene groups adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a ketone, the adjacent CH2 groups would split into a multiplet around 2.2-2.4 ppm. The 10H suggests five CH2 groups, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, it's a set of methylenes adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, the 10H could also be from bridged or ring structures. For example, in adamantane, each bridgehead has two CH2 groups. So perhaps the 10H is from five CH2 groups, each giving two H.

Wait, but that's 5 CH2 groups, which is 10H. Then the 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2, perhaps in a different environment.

The 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a diester, but the IR doesn't show that.

Wait, maybe the product is a geminal diester, but that's speculative.

I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should move to the next step and see if that gives any clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess Al isopropoxide. Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide to form product 3.

Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Therefore, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

So product 2 has a double bond. But product 1 doesn't have a double bond, unless product 2 is a diene. Wait, but product 1's NMR doesn't show peaks that would suggest a double bond, unless the protons are in a different region.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a diene formed via some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, but product 1 is a solid formed via KOH and heating. If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is formed by treatment with a Lewis acid, perhaps inducing some kind of elimination to form a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, making an enone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alcohol, and product 2 is an ether or an acetal.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether. Then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond in the enol ether.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think again: product 3 is formed after ozonolysis. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

In ozonolysis, a double bond is cleaved into two carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, product 3 will have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, or a vinylic proton if any.

Wait, but ozonolysis typically breaks the double bond into two carbonyls. So any protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear around 2.1-2.5 ppm as CH2 groups.

But the question is about the coupling pattern. Let me think about the possible structure after ozonolysis.

Suppose product 2 is an enone (conjugated dienone), like CH2=CH-CO-R. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyls, maybe forming something like O=CH- and R-CO-CH2-OH, but that's in the presence of water. Wait, but in the question, after ozonolysis, dimethylsulfide is added, which is a reductive work-up, preventing the formation of peroxides and instead forming aldehydes/ketones.

Wait, but if product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is a cyclohexene derivative, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls, creating a diketone or dialdehyde.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure.

Wait, let's think about the first step again. Product 1's IR is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So it's a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. Considering the reaction conditions, it's more likely a ketone because KOH is a base, and aldehydes are usually more reactive but might not form under these conditions.

So if product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is formed by treating with Al isopropoxide. I'm not sure what reaction that would be, but perhaps it's an elimination to form a double bond, making an enone.

So product 2 would have a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl, making an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Then, ozonolysis would cleave this double bond.

But wait, ozonolysis of an enone would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is CH2=C-CO-R, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls: O=CH2 and CO-R. But wait, that's a bit simplistic.

Wait, another example: If the structure is something like (CH2)2C=CH-CO-R, ozonolysis would cleave into two carbonyl compounds.

But perhaps in this case, the product 3 will have two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded H would be adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps as a CH2 group.

But the question is about the coupling pattern. Let me think, in product 3, after ozonolysis, each carbonyl group would be connected to some CH2 groups. The most deshielded Hs would be near the carbonyl.

For instance, suppose after ozonolysis, a CH2 group is next to a carbonyl. The Hs on that CH2 would be split by neighboring groups. If each CH2 is next to another CH2, they might form a triplet.

Alternatively, if
