Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target compound. Benzene has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. So, positions 1, 2, and 3 each have a substituent. Wait, no, wait. Let me visualize the benzene ring. The numbering would be such that the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that's possible. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so substituents at 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent in a meta arrangement. Wait, maybe the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions as in adjacent positions, but that might not be possible because benzene can't have three substituents all adjacent in that way. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the numbering. Let me think: the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So, if I imagine benzene with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3, that would form a kind of isosceles triangle arrangement. But perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So, the numbering would have ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. That arrangement might allow for certain directing effects.

Now, the goal is to find the correct sequence of reactions starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of steps. Each step involves a specific reagent, so I need to figure out which order of functional group additions and substitutions will give the desired product.

I remember that benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions. The order in which substituents are added will affect the positions where subsequent groups attach because substituents can be activating or deactivating and can direct incoming groups to certain positions (ortho, meta, para).

Let me start by considering each substituent and their directing effects.

1. tert-Butyl group: This is a bulky alkyl group. Alkyl groups are activating (since they're electron-donating via the inductive effect) and are ortho/para directors. So when adding a substituent after an alkyl group, the incoming group will go to ortho or para positions relative to the alkyl.

2. Nitro group: This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So if the nitro is added after something else, it will direct incoming groups to the meta positions relative to itself.

3. Ethoxy group: The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para director. But wait, wait. Wait, the ethoxy group is an ether, right? So OCH2CH3. Since it's an activating group, it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But wait, the problem is that if we add the ethoxy group after another substituent, the directing depends on the previous substituents.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. So perhaps the order in which substituents are added is important.

Another thing to consider is the possibility of using nitrating and sulfonating agents, which are commonly used in such syntheses.

Let me outline what each step does in the options:

Option A:
i) tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene would get a tert-butyl group. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires the activating group. Benzene can undergo this, but it's more common to do it after activating groups, but since benzene is activated enough (though not as much as with a substituent), but wait, wait. Friedel-Crafts alkylation on benzene is possible but may require more forcing conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butyl chloride is used in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I've heard that bulky alkyl groups like tert-butyl are more challenging because of carbocation rearrangements. Hmm, perhaps it's better done via a different method, but I'll proceed.

After adding the tert-butyl group, the next step is ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration. So the nitration occurs after the tert-butyl is attached. Nitration is a meta director, but since the benzene already has a substituent (tert-butyl, an activating group), the nitro group will enter in the meta position relative to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but the initial substituent is the tert-butyl. So after that comes nitration. So the nitro group will be in the meta position relative to the tert-butyl.

Then step iii) SO3/H2SO4: That's sulfonation. Sulfonic acid groups are strong deactivating, meta directors. But wait, when you sulfonate a benzene ring that already has substituents, the position depends on the directing of the existing groups. But wait, in the target molecule, there's no sulfonic acid group. Wait, the target molecule has an ethoxy group, not a sulfonic acid. So if step iii is sulfonation, that would add a -SO3H group. But the target molecule has an ethoxy group. So perhaps this is a wrong option because introducing a sulfonic acid group isn't part of the target.

Hmm, so option A's step iii is adding a sulfonic acid group, which isn't wanted in the target. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Option B:

i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation, adds tert-butyl group.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4: Nitration. So now, benzene has a tert-butyl and a nitro group.

Wait, but when you have a benzene ring with two substituents, the positions of the new substituent depend on the combined directing effects.

The tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para director. The nitro group is deactivating, meta director. So which effect is stronger? The nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so it's a meta director, but the substituent that's present first may have a more significant influence on the position where the next group enters.

Wait, but in this case, the second substituent is the nitro, added after the tert-butyl. So the benzene first gets tert-butyl at position X (let's say position 1). Then, when nitrated, the nitro group would be added in the meta position relative to the tert-butyl. So nitro at position 4 (if tert-butyl is 1), but wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let's imagine the tert-butyl is at position 1. Nitration would occur at position 4 (meta to 1), or maybe positions 3 or 5? Wait, for a meta director, the incoming group would be in the meta position relative to the existing substituent. So if the existing substituent is at position 1, the nitro would go to position 4? Wait, no. Because in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The meta position from 1 would be 4. Hmm, maybe I should sketch this. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group would go into position 4, but that depends on the directing of the substituents.

Wait, but wait, the nitro group is a meta director. So when you nitrate a benzene ring that already has a substituent (like tert-butyl), the nitro would enter in the meta position relative to the substituent. So if the substituent is at position 1, the nitro would be at position 4. But that's a possibility, but I'm
