Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, the pion is at rest, right? So it's a decay process where the pion, which is stationary, decays into a muon and a neutrino. I remember that in such decay processes, energy and momentum must be conserved, but since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta to maintain that.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think the muon has a rest mass of around 105.7 MeV and the pion is 139.6 MeV. Oh, right, the masses are given in the question. So the pion is heavier than the muon, which makes sense for decay because the daughter particles must have less mass than the parent.

Since the pion is at rest, the total energy available is its rest mass energy. But wait, the rest energy of the pion is converted into the rest mass of the muon and the kinetic energies of the products. Also, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so we can probably treat it as massless for this problem.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + KE_mu, and E_nu = KE_nu (since m_nu is negligible). So E_initial = E_mu + E_nu.

But we also have to consider momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. So, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Then the neutrino's momentum must be -p. But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy is E_nu = |p| c.

For the muon, its energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). So, E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

Putting it all together:

139.6 MeV = sqrt( p² c^4 + (105.7 MeV)^2 ) + |p| c

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Wait, but that would involve some algebra. Alternatively, I can let x = p c, then the equation becomes:

139.6 = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x

Let me write that as:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (13
