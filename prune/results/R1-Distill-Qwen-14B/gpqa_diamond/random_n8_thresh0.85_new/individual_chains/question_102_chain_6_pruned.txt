Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit involved, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the setup is that someone has identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, I think from the cytomegalovirus, but wait, no, CBA is a chicken beta-actin promoter with an enhancer. It's often used for strong expression in various cells. Then, upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so it can drive the expression of the downstream ORF in a translational internal ribosome entry site-dependent manner, which is useful for co-expressing two genes in a single vector.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh, right, so these stop cassettes are under the control of loxP sites. So using Cre recombinase, these can be excised. LoxP is the standard site for Cre to recombine, and lox2272 is a variant that Cre can also act on, but sometimes only in certain conditions. 

They also raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte cultures. The blot showed signals proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed correctly. Because if the loading is consistent, the signals should correlate with the presence of the proteins.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression under the control of the SOX10 promoter, meaning Cre is active in neural crest derivatives, like in the cells of interest here.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for fluorescence. The problem is that there's no green signal. eGFP is green, so they're expecting the receptor to be expressed and eGFP to fluoresce. But they didn't see it.

So the question is why there's no green signal. The options are A to D.

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that relate to expression in the mouse? The construct is in the same cell, so if they're expressing both, the ligand would activate the receptor on the same cell. Unless the ligand is secreted, but I'm not sure how this affects the Western blot or the eGFP expression. Also, the Western blot showed that the proteins are expressed, so this might not be the issue.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor is stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't reach the cell surface, so eGFP wouldn't be visible. But why would Cre cause this? Wait, wait. Wait, the construct uses IRES between the receptor and eGFP. IRES allows for the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed, as the ribosome can bypass the stop codon and translate the eGFP. But if the receptor is properly processed, it should be at the cell surface. If it's stuck in Golgi, maybe the eGFP wouldn't be properly expressed either. But the initial Western blot in the astrocyte culture showed that the proteins were expressed. So maybe this isn't the issue in the mouse.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. Both are under the CBA promoter? Wait, no. The ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. The CBA promoter is strong, so the ligand is likely expressed. For the receptor, the IRES would allow for its expression. But IRES elements can sometimes require certain conditions. But the Western blot showed that the proteins are expressed when transfected. So maybe in the mouse, something's wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the CBA promoter isn't active in the cells where the Cre is active. But the SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, and the CBA promoter is strong and constitutive. So maybe the enhancers are not present. Wait, the question says the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. Hmm, not sure.

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. Oh, wait, the construct for the receptor is fused to eGFP. If the ORF is in frame, they'll be expressed as a single protein. If not, the eGFP won't be correctly translated. So if the stop codon is not in frame, the eGFP might be truncated or not expressed. But wait, the vector has a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) between receptor and eGFP. So in the absence of Cre, the stop codon is present, which would terminate translation at the receptor ORF. So in the presence of Cre, the stop is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed. But in the mouse, is the Cre active? They crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stop between receptor and eGFP would be removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed alongside the receptor. If the eGFP is in frame, it would fluoresce. If not, it wouldn't. So perhaps the fusion isn't in frame, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the initial Western blot
