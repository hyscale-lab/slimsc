Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me start by understanding the scenario. Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, below 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron beam, right?

But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, so it depends on factors like pressure and temperature.

Then, when Mike turns on the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. But the temperature stayed the same. Hmm, why would that happen?

Wait, mean free path is usually given by the formula λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. Or another version I've heard is λ = (1)/(sqrt(2)*n*σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. Since the temperature is the same, T doesn't change. Pressure is also the same because the vacuum level hasn't changed—so pressure P is the same.

Wait, but wait a minute. The presence of the electron beam might affect things. The electrons are moving at high speeds, right? The electron beam could cause the gas molecules to move or even ionize them. Oh, wait, but the mean free path is about the movement of the gas molecules themselves, not the electrons. Or is it about how the electrons interact with the gas.

Wait, in an electron microscope, the electron beam can interact with the gas molecules. If there are gas particles, the electrons can scatter off them. So when the beam is off, the gas has a certain mean free path based on their collisions with each other. But when the beam is on, the electrons are another source of collisions for the gas molecules. So the gas molecules now have another way to collide—not just with each other but also with the electrons.

So the electrons would act as another type of 'collider' for the gas molecules. That would increase the effective number of collisions the gas molecules undergo. Because before the beam was on, the gas molecules were only colliding with each other. Now, each gas molecule might also collide with the electrons, which could be moving at a different speed.

Wait, but the mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So if the electrons are causing additional collisions, that would reduce the mean free path. Because the gas molecules are colliding more frequently—so λ2 should be less than λ1.

Let me think about how the mean free path is calculated. The usual formula for gas mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where P is pressure. But when there are other particles (like the electrons) present, their presence would change the effective pressure or the effective number density.

Alternatively, the scattering of electrons by gas molecules would involve the electron's cross-section with the gas. The electrons are much lighter and moving faster than the gas molecules, I think. So each gas molecule presents a target for the electrons, but in this case, we're considering the gas's mean free path based on their own collisions.

Wait no, actually, in this scenario, the mean free path λ2 is the mean free path of the gas molecules, but now considering collisions with the electron beam. Wait, no, maybe it's the electrons that are colliding with the gas, but the question is about the gas's mean free path. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the question says that upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observed that the mean free path of the gas molecules changed. So the gas molecules' mean free path is now λ2 instead of λ1. But why?

Wait, when the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized or excited by the electrons. But more likely, the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules, which would cause the electrons to change direction. But how does that affect the gas's mean free path?

Alternatively, maybe the gas molecules are being bombarded by the electrons, which could cause them to move more, perhaps increasing the effective temperature? But the problem states that the sample compartment's temperature remained the same, so that can't be it.

Wait, so the initial mean free path λ1 was calculated based on the gas molecules' self-collisions. But when the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules now have another source of collision: the electrons. So the mean free path for the gas molecules would decrease because they're colliding more often—either with other gas molecules or with the electrons.

Wait, but in the mean free path formula, collisions can be due to other gas molecules or any particles in the system. So if the beam introduces more particles (or more scattering events), then the effective number of collisions increases, which reduces the mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path is from the gas's perspective. So the gas molecules are moving and colliding with other gas molecules. The electrons are moving, too, and perhaps colliding with the gas molecules as well. But in this case, the electrons are part of the environment, so the gas molecules' mean free path would be affected by both their own kind of collisions and collisions with electrons.

Wait, but how do electrons affect the gas's mean free path? Electrons are much lighter and perhaps moving faster. So a gas molecule's mean free path would be the distance it travels before colliding with anything—be it another gas molecule or an electron.

So in the initial state, λ1 is the mean free path considering only collisions between gas molecules. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can also collide with electrons. So the effective cross-section for collisions increases because each electron contributes to possible collisions. So the mean free path would be shorter because the gas molecules are now colliding more often—either with each other or with the electrons.

So λ2 should be less than λ1. So looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be the correct choice.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike achieved an ultra-high vacuum (< 10^-9 Torr) in the sample compartment to minimize gas molecules for improved imaging. Despite this, some gas particles remained, and Mike calculated their mean free path as λ1 based on factors like pressure and temperature. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the mean free path to λ2, even though the temperature remained constant.

The mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Initially, λ1 was determined based on collisions between gas molecules alone. However, when the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules now have an additional source of collisions: the electrons in the beam. The electron beam introduces more frequent collisions for the gas molecules, reducing their mean free path. This is because the effective number of collisions increases due to interactions with the electrons, in addition to collisions between gas molecules.

Since the mean free path depends on the rate of collisions, the presence of the electron beam effectively reduces the mean free path of the gas molecules. Therefore, λ2, the mean free path under these new conditions, is less than λ1.

Answer: C
