Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question asks about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, right, neutralization reactions usually involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is the heat change when one mole of acid reacts with one mole of base.

Wait, but these are three different solutions. So I need to figure out how they react when mixed. Let me list out what each solution is.

First, we have HCl. That's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. HCl → H+ + Cl-.

Then there's H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, it can donate two H+ ions. So in solution, it would dissociate into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

The third solution is Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. But wait, mixing all three might complicate things because multiple H+ sources are present.

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution.

Let's compute the moles for each:

1. HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since each HCl gives one H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4: volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, so H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Ba(OH)2: volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so OH- moles = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, let's sum up all H+ and OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles.

So the H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, but neutralization reactions are between H+ and OH-. So the limiting reactant here is OH- because there's only 0.2 moles of OH- available to react with the H+.

So let's see:

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this is usually around -57.3 kJ per mole (but wait, the options have kcal and kJ, so I need to be careful with units).

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually about -57.3 kJ/mol, but sometimes it's given per mole of H+ or per mole of OH-.

But wait, let me think about the exact value. Oh right, the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is typically the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form water. So each mole of H+ neutralization releases 57.3 kJ (or about -57.3 kJ because it's exothermic).

So in this case, we have 0.2 moles of OH-, so the maximum possible reaction is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

But wait, the H+ available is 0.28 moles. So only 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles OH-.

So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * 57.3 kJ/mol.

Calculating that: 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. But since it's exothermic, the ΔH is negative, so -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kJ and kcal
