Okay, so I've got this problem about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... right, that's when the incident particles (in this case, electrons) are scattered without any loss of energy. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in the direction of the incident beam.

Wait, phase shifts are involved here. I remember that in scattering theory, especially in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The formula I think is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum over l of (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) * [something with Legendre polynomials? Oh right, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ)].

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So, along the beam direction, the scattering angle θ is zero degrees, right? Because the beam is the original direction, and the scattered particles are moving in the same line as the incident beam. So θ = 0°, which is along the original direction.

Wait, when θ is zero, what happens to the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ)? Because cos(0) is 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l, I think. Because Legendre polynomials at 1 are always 1. Oh yeah, for each l, P_l(1)=1, so that's a simplification.

So the scattering amplitude f(θ=0) would then be (1/k) sum over l of (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) * 1. So f(0) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, but they give me δ_0, δ_1, δ_2, δ_3, δ_4. Oh, so I need to consider l=0,1,2,3,4.

So the scattering amplitude f is given by f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Hmm, but we're only asked for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So let's think about that.

The imaginary part of f, Im(f), would be (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) Im( e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ) ).

Wait, e^{i δ_l} is cos δ_l + i sin δ_l. So e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l = sin δ_l * (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l) = sin δ_l cos δ_l + i (sin^2 δ_l).

So the imaginary part is sin^2 δ_l.

So, Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) (sin^2 δ_l).

So I need to calculate the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) * sin^2 δ_l, then multiply by 1/k.

But wait, what's k? Because the scattering amplitude has units of inverse momentum, I think. So k is the magnitude of the wave vector.

Wait, electrons with energy 50 MeV. Let's see, we can compute k from the electron's momentum.

The energy of the electron is given as 50 MeV. Since electrons are relativistic, but perhaps for nonrelativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). But wait, 50 MeV is a pretty high energy. Let me think about how to compute k.

The relation between momentum (p) and energy (E) for relativistic particles is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. But electrons have a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV/c². So 50 MeV is much larger than 0.511 MeV, so we can approximate that E ≈ pc, since (pc) would be about 50 MeV, and (m c²) is negligible compared to that.

So, p ≈ E / c = 50 MeV / c.

Wait, but we need to find k. Since k = p / ħ. So, I'll need to compute p in terms of kg·m/s, then divide by Planck's constant over 2π to get k in 1/m.

Wait, let's get the units straight.

First, let's compute p in kg·m/s.

E = 50 MeV = 50 × 1e6 × 1.602e-13 J (since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 MeV is 1e6 eV → 1.602e-13 J). So 50 MeV is 50e6 * 1.602e-13 J =
