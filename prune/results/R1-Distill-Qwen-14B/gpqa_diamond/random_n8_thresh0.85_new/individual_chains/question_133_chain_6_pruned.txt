Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate would be PO4^3- I think. 

So the problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid, you get a buffer solution. So in this case, KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 probably form a buffer. 

Wait, let's think about the salts. KH2PO4 is the potassium salt of H2PO4^- (which is the dihydrogen phosphate ion). Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate. So Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So the two components here are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The species in solution might include H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But since we're dealing with a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the relevant Ka is Ka2 because that's the one governing the dissociation between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The first dissociation (Ka1) is H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-.
The second (Ka2) is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.
The third (Ka3) is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

So if we have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, that's a buffer system with the second dissociation. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

Now, since we have a buffer solution, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). 

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So [base] is the concentration of HPO4^2-, and [acid] is the concentration of H2PO4^-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which
