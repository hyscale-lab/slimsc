Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, right? Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the wave function of a particle in a tube, and we need to find the normalization constant 'a'. 

Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. So, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should be 1.

The given wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, no, wait, is it? Let me read it again. Oh, wait, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So, ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i. Wait, but the way it's written might be a bit ambiguous. Oh, no, I think actually, the entire (a/sqrt(1+x)) is multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but no, the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Hmm, perhaps it's a sum of two terms? Wait, no, probably it's (a divided by the sqrt(1+x)) minus (0.5 times i). So, ψ(x) is a complex function: the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, but I think I might have misread that. Let me check: the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, it's a complex function where the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So, ψ(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (-0.5i).

Wait, but that would imply that the imaginary part is a constant, which is interesting. So, the wave function can be written as ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i. So, the real part depends on x, and the imaginary part is constant.

Now, to normalize this wave function, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must be 1. Because the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, and nowhere else,
