Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar chemistry, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I don't think the masses directly affect the ratio of silicon we're looking for. The key data are the elemental abundances determined using the EW method under LTE.

The given abundances are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of (X/Y ratio) relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun )

For Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, which means Fe/H ratio is same as Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (Fe/H)_1 = 10^0 = 1 → Fe in Star_1 is same as Sun. Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0 → Mg in Star_2 same as Sun.

We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 photospheres, [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2]?

Wait, no. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So Si_1 / Si_2.

Hmm. Let's think about each star's silicon abundance.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, Fe in Star_1 is same as Sun. The Sun's Fe abundance is known. So [Si/Fe] is Si/Fe ratio compared to the Sun.

Wait, [X/Y] = log10( (X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun )

So for Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 2 times that of the Sun.

But the Sun's Fe is known. Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Wait, no, the Sun's nFe/nH is given as 10^(-4.5),
