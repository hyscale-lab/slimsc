Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their orbits are circular.

The host stars are interesting. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Oh, wait—Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but their radii are equal. So, same size stars, different masses.

The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

Transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, more accurately, it's about the alignment. The probability is roughly (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by the geometric probability, which is actually (R_star / a), but wait, no, I think the geometric probability is proportional to (R_star / a). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the formula.

The transit probability (P) is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R*)^2 * (R* / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M*) )) )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. I recall that the geometric probability is approximately (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since the RV method gives us the minimum mass, but we might not need that here because we're only given the same masses for both planets. Wait, but the mass comes into play when considering the actual mass for the transit probability? Or is it about the inclination?

Wait, I think the transit probability is mainly about the orbital geometry. For a planet to transit, its orbital plane needs to be aligned edge-on with our line of sight. The probability of this is roughly (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's the geometric probability of alignment, which is (R*/a) * (something else?).

Wait, no, the geometric probability is actually (R*/a) * (something else). Let me think again. The transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. It's given by (R*/a) times the probability of the planet's orbital plane being inclined enough. But wait, no, the formula I remember is P = (R_p + R*) / (a) * (something else?), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_p / R*)² × (R* / a) × ( (1 + cos i) / 2 )

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another source says that the transit probability (assuming random orientation) is approximately (R*/a), because for a given semi-major axis, the chance that the orbital plane is edge-on enough is proportional to (R*/a). So the higher (R*/a), the higher the probability.

So, the transit probability is proportional to (R*/a). Therefore, to find which planet has higher probability, we need to compute (R_*/a) for each and compare.

But wait, how do we get a, the semi-major axis? Because the period is given, perhaps we can use Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = (G(M_* + M_p)) / (4π²). But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate a^3 = (G M_*) (P^2)/(4π²).

But since both planets have the same mass, but their host stars have different masses, and their periods are different, the semi-major axis a will vary.

Let me write down the variables:

For Planet_1:

M1 = 2 M2 (since the star's mass is twice that of Planet_2's host)
P1 = P2 / 3 (since the period is three times shorter)

For Planet_2:

M2 = M2 (the host's mass)
P2 = P2

So let's express a1 and a2.

Using Kepler's third law, a^3 = (G M_*) (P/(2π))^2 * (something else?)

Wait, the exact formula is a^3 = (G(M_*) P^2) / (4 π²). So,

a1³ = (G * M1 * P1²) / (4 π²)
a2³ = (G * M2 * P2²) / (4 π²)

So, a1³ / a2³ = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²)

Given M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 /3, so P1² = P2² /9.

So,

a1³/a2³ = (2 M2 / M2) * ( (P2²/9) / P2² ) ) = 2 * (1/9) = 2/9

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222, cube root of that is about 0.6. Let me compute it exactly.

Cube root of 2 is about 1.26, cube root of 9 is about 2.08, so 2/9 is 0.222, cube root is (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)^(1/3) / (9)^(1/3) ≈ 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is about 0.6 times that of Planet_2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a), since R* is the same for both (given that both host stars have the same radius).

So for Planet_1: (R*/a1) = R* / (0.606 a2) ≈ (1 / 0.606) * (R*/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R*/a2)

For Planet_2: (R*/a2) = R*/a2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability because (R*/a1) is about 1.65 times (R*/a2).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compute (R*/a) for both and compare.

Wait, the formula for transit probability is P = (R_*/a) * (something else), but in the approximation, it's proportional to (R_*/a). So higher (R*/a) → higher probability.

So for Planet_1,

(R_1*/a1) = R* / a1.

Which is R* / (0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R*/a2)

So Planet_1's (R*/a) is 1.65 times that of Planet_2's (R*/a).

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of about 1.65.

Therefore, the researchers should choose Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which seems higher than what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. Let me recompute a1 in terms of a2.

We have:

a1³ = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²) * a2³.

M1 = 2 M2.

P1 = P2/3 → P1² = P2² /9.

So,

a1³ = (2) * (1/9) * a2³ → a1³ = (2/9) a2³.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

What's (2/9)^(1/3)? Let me compute it more accurately.

(2/9) is approximately 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606, as before.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Thus, R*/a1 = R*/(0.606a2) = (1/0.606) * (R*/a2) ≈ 1.648 * (R*/a2).

So the ratio is approximately 1.65.

So the transit probability of Planet_1 is about 1.65 times higher than that of Planet_2.

Therefore, the correct answer is either C or D. Option C says 1.65 times, D says 2.7 times.

Wait, did I miss something? Wait, perhaps the transit probability isn't just (R*/a), but it's (R_p / R*)^2 * (R*/a).

Wait, that's because the area blocked is (R_p/R*)^2, and the geometric probability is (R*/a), so the total probability is (R_p^2 R*) )/( R*^2 a ) ) → (R_p^2)/(R* a).

Wait, so the probability is proportional to (R_p^2) / (R* a).

But in the given question, both planets have the same mass. But that doesn't necessarily mean they have the same radius. Wait, wait, the question says they are Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are similar to Earth. But if the question doesn't specify, perhaps R_p is the same for both.

Wait, the question says "two Earth-like planets", but it doesn't state their radii are the same. But since it's Earth-like, perhaps we can assume their radii are similar, but it's not given. Hmm.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's said that they have the same masses. Oh, but Earth-like planets with the same mass would have similar radii, but not necessarily the same. But the transit probability depends on R_p, the planet's radius.

Wait, the question doesn't state that the planet radii are the same. Hmm. So perhaps the researchers can't assume that. But since the question is about the transit probability, and the planets have same mass but not necessarily same radius, but the problem doesn't provide their radii, so probably, the R_p is considered the same, as they are Earth-like.

Wait, but if the problem doesn't state that the planets have the same radius, perhaps I should think that it's not given, so I can't assume. So perhaps, I shouldn't include R_p in the calculation because it's not provided.

Wait, but the question says "the researchers have chosen to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting." So, the transit probability is given by (R_p/R* )^2 * (R*/a) = (R_p^2)/(R* a).

But since both planets are Earth-like, perhaps R_p is roughly the same for both. But the question didn't specify, so maybe we're supposed to ignore R_p and assume it's the same, or perhaps the problem considers only the (R*/a) part.

Wait, looking back, the question says both have the same masses. So, same minimum masses. But mass isn't directly the same as radius. Earth's mass and radius are related, but for exoplanets, more massive planets can be larger or smaller than Earth (like gas giants). But Earth-like implies similar size, but not necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem only wants us to consider the (R*/a) factor, ignoring the planet's radius. Because if the planet's radius isn't given, perhaps that part can't be considered, and the main factor is (R*/a).

Alternatively, perhaps in the given options, the ratio is calculated without considering R_p, but only (R*/a). Because the problem doesn't give R_p, so the only thing to compare is (R*/a).

So, if that's the case, then the earlier calculation holds: Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher (R*/a), so higher probability.

So looking at the options, option C is "Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit."

But wait, the options don't all have the same factor. Let me check the options again:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher.

So according to our calculation, option C is correct.

But wait, another thought: the transit probability also depends on the inclination. But since the RV method detects planets via their Doppler shift, which doesn't require the orbit to be edge-on, unlike the transit method. So for RV, the inclination can be any angle, but the transit requires edge-on. So, the RV method gives a minimum mass (since sin i is involved), but the actual mass could be higher if inclination is higher. However, the question states that both planets have the same masses, so perhaps their actual masses are same, meaning sin i is same? Or perhaps their masses are the same, so the same minimum mass. Hmm, perhaps this is complicating.

But in any case, the transit probability is based on the alignment, which for each planet is independent, so our earlier calculation should hold.

So the answer is option C, Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_*}{a}
\]

where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. The semi-major axis can be derived using Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M_* P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

### Given Information:
1. **Planet_1**:
   - Host star mass: \( M_1 = 2M_2 \)
   - Orbital period: \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)
   - Host star radius: \( R_* \) (same as Planet_2's host star)

2. **Planet_2**:
   - Host star mass: \( M_2 \)
   - Orbital period: \( P_2 \)
   - Host star radius: \( R_* \) (same as Planet_1's host star)

### Step 1: Compute the ratio of semi-major axes
From Kepler's third law, the ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{P_1^2}{P_2^2}
\]

Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{P_2^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus:

\[
a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2
\]

### Step 2: Compute the transit probability ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606 a_2} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 2.25.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability ratio is approximately 1.65.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Final Answer:
The researchers should prefer Planet_1, as it has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2.

**Answer: C**
