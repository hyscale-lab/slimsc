Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid with an inducible overexpression system. They added a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies to test the construct's expression. But they can't overexpress the protein. The question is why, based on the provided DNA sequence.

Looking at the DNA sequence provided, the issue is likely in the construct. Let me analyze the sequence.

First, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). That's good because it means translation should start. Then, I see the sequence continues for a while. Wait, perhaps I should check for any stop codons or other issues.

Wait, stop codons are UAA, UAG, or UGA. Since this is the plus strand, the mRNA will be complementary to this. So the mRNA will have the same sequence as the plus DNA strand, except T becomes U.

Let me look for any of these stop codons in the mRNA. Let me go through the sequence.

Looking at the sequence... Hmm, let's see. Let me break it down into triplets because mRNA is read in triplets during translation.

Wait, the given sequence is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be the same except T to U. So any in-frame stop codon in the DNA would be a stop in the mRNA.

Looking for sequences that form UAA, UAG, or UGA in the mRNA.

Starting from the beginning:

Wait, looking for UAA, UAG, UGA. Let me go through each triplet.

Looking for 'UAA' in the mRNA. Since the DNA is the plus strand, the mRNA would have the same sequence except T to U. So any 'TAA' in the DNA would be 'UAA' in the mRNA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, looking at the DNA sequence, let's see:

Looking for any 'TAA' in the DNA.
