Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of "a" given the wave function. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but that's a bit confusing because wave functions are supposed to be square-integrable, right? So they need to satisfy the normalization condition. Oh right, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

But wait, in this problem, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region, and the given function is valid between 1 and 3. So I should set up the integral from 1 to 3 of the absolute square of the wave function.

Wait, let me write down the wave function properly. It's ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. Wait a second, that might be a complex function. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave function can be complex, but the probability density is the absolute square. So the probability density is |ψ(x)|² = [a / sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2. Because when you take the absolute square of a complex number a + bi, it's (a)^2 + (b)^2, right? Wait, no, actually, it's (a + bi)(a - bi) = a² + b². So in this case, a is the real part, and 0.5i is the imaginary part. So ψ* (the complex conjugate) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply ψ by ψ*, I get [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5)^2.

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. Hmm, but wait, no, because the wave function is ψ = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I take the absolute square, I get (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, which is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait, the problem says that when they
