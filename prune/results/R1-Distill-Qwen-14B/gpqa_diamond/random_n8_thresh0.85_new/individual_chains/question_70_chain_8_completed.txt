Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of a product E. Hmm, let me read through the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

And the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

Alright, let's try to deduce what the compounds might be. Let me break it down step by step.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C. Solid A reacting with gas B, forming a bright red product C. Bright red makes me think of something like a metal oxide, maybe copper(II) oxide? Wait, but copper oxide is usually black. Oh, wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction forming a metal sulfide? Or perhaps a different kind of compound.

Wait, another thought: when a metal reacts with a halogen, especially in a high ratio, like 8 equivalents. For example, if B is a halogen, say chlorine (Cl2), and A is a metal that forms a +2 cation. So, 8 equivalents of Cl2 would mean each A is taking four Cl2 molecules, perhaps forming something like ACl4. Wait, but what produces a red product? Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal.

Alternatively, let's think of another possibility. The bright red product could be something like iron(III) oxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction forming a complex ion or a coordination compound.

Wait, another angle: the second reaction is C + 2 D → E. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents are often polar aprotic (like DMSO, DMF, etc.) or maybe something else. But D reacting with B in 1:1 to form H. If H is a solvent, maybe D is something like H2O or an alcohol? But wait, B is a gas, so it's likely a diatomic molecule. Let's think: if B is Cl2, D could be something like H2O or another gas.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2. So in the first reaction, A is a metal that reacts with Cl2 to form a chloride. So 8 equivalents would mean that each mole of A takes 8 moles of Cl2. That would imply a formula like ACl4, but wait, that's not possible because metals typically have positive charges; but 8 Cl would be 4 Cl per A, so ACl4^2- or something? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal that forms a +2 cation, and each molecule of A combines with four Cl2 molecules to form ACl4. Wait, but that would require each Cl2 molecule providing two Cl- ions. So each Cl2 gives two Cl, so 4 Cl2 would contribute 8 Cl. So A^2+ would combine with 8 Cl^- to form ACl8^2-? That seems a bit unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a coordination compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is iron metal, and B is Cl2. Then, Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But wait, FeCl3 is a solid, but the product C is bright red. Hmm. Wait, does FeCl3 have a red color? I think it's more of a yellowish-brown color when dissolved in water. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, could it be a reaction where solid A is a metal and B is O2? Like forming a metal oxide. But O2 is a gas. So A + O2 → metal oxide. But in that case, would the product be red? I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. One strong (like HCl, H2SO4) and another weak (like HCN, CH3COOH).

Wait, if C is a chloride, maybe an oxychloride. For example, perhaps C is sodium chlorate or something similar. But wait, when it reacts with water, it forms a strong acid and a weak acid. Hmm, maybe C is a metal oxychloride, like CuOCl, which upon hydrolysis produces HCl (strong acid) and another acid. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate. But that might not lead to two different acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, another angle: reaction of C with water gives a metal (A) and two acids. So maybe C is a metal chloride that's more complex. For example, if C is something like AClO3 (chlorate), which when hydrolyzed produces HClO3 (which is a strong acid?), but wait, HClO3 is a strong acid? I think it's a moderately strong acid but not as strong as HCl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal carbonate? No, because then upon hydrolysis, you'd get CO2 and H2O, and the metal hydroxide. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal chloride, like FeCl3. When FeCl3 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into Fe(OH)3 and HCl. But HCl is a strong acid, and what about the other product? Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. But the question says two acids F and G. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe C is a mixed anhydride or a complex. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate, like CuClO4. When that reacts with water, it would form Cu(OH)2 (a base) and HClO4, which is a strong acid. But the problem states two different acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7). When it reacts with water, it forms Na2CrO4 and H2Cr2O7? No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, when dichromate salts are hydrolyzed, they can form chromic acid (H2CrO4) and other products. But I'm not sure about the exact products.

Wait, another thought: if C is a nitride of a metal, like Mg3N2. When it reacts with water, it forms Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's see: the reaction C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So perhaps C is a metal sulfate? No, because sulfate usually gives H2SO4 upon hydrolysis, which is a strong acid, but then where does the weak acid come from? Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxysulfate.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the reactions in order.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C.

Second reaction: C + 2 D → E.

Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G.

Fourth reaction: D + B → H (solvent).

Let me think about the fourth reaction first. D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B are gases, and H is a liquid (solvent). So if B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, O2, or N2, and D is another gas like H2O (but H2O is a liquid at room temp). Wait, but D is a gas, so maybe D is something like CO2 or NH3? But NH3 is a gas but can be a solvent when in liquid form under pressure. Hmm.

Wait, H is a solvent, so it could be something like H2O (water), but if B is Cl2, and D is H2O, then H would be HCl? No, that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2. Then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense.

Wait, if B is O2 and D is H2, then their reaction in a 1:1 ratio would form H2O. So D is H2, B is O2, H is H2O.

Then, in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C. What solid A reacts with O2 in large amounts to form a bright-red product? Maybe iron? Iron reacts with O2 to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Fe2O3 is reddish, but is it bright red? I think it's more of a reddish-brown. Alternatively, copper might form CuO, which is black.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is sulfur. Sulfur (solid) reacts with O2 (gas) to form SO3 (which is a gas, not a solid). Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is orange, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal that forms a red-colored oxide, like cobalt oxide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I'm on the wrong track. Let's think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E. If D is H2, then 2 D would be 2 H2 molecules. So C + 2 H2 → E. What reaction would that be? Maybe a reduction reaction. For example, if C is a metal oxide, adding H2 could reduce it to the metal. But in that case, E would be the metal, but that doesn't seem right because the first reaction forms C from A (the metal) and O2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is another gas, like CO2. But then D + B (O2) would form CO, which is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2. Because Cl2 is a common diatomic gas. Then D is a gas that reacts with Cl2 in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So what gas D reacts with Cl2 to form a solvent? Maybe H2O? But H2O is not a gas under standard conditions. Or perhaps D is CH4, but CH4 + Cl2 under certain conditions can form CCl4, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, maybe D is H2O (but it's a liquid, not a gas). Wait, perhaps D is NH3? NH3 is a gas and when it reacts with Cl2, it can form NH2Cl or other products, but I'm not sure if that's a solvent.

Wait, wait. Another approach: if H is a solvent, perhaps it's something like H2O, which is a common solvent. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then H is H2O. That would fit the 1:1 ratio (since O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O). So 1 mole of O2 reacts with 2 moles of H2 to form 2 moles of H2O. But the problem states that D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit, because O2 would need 2 H2 for each O2.

Hmm, maybe the ratio is per mole. So if D is something that reacts with B 1:1. For example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O (gaseous?), but under high pressure, maybe H2O can be gaseous. Then, H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe D is O3 (ozone), but ozone is a gas and reacts with B (Cl2) in a certain ratio? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about C reacting with water to form A and two acids. So C is a compound that when hydrolyzed gives a metal (A), a strong acid (F), and a weak acid (G). For example, sodium sulfide (Na2S) when hydrolyzed gives NaOH (strong base), but that's not an acid. Hmm.

Another example: maybe C is a metal carbonyl. When hydrolyzed, it could form a metal hydroxide, CO, and maybe some acid. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Ca3N2 reacts with water to produce Ca(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to form NaOH and O2. But again, not two acids.

Alternatively, think about the products F and G. One is strong acid, the other weak. So perhaps F is HCl and G is H2CO3 (carbonic acid, weak). So C could be something like NaClO3 (chlorate). When it reacts with water, it would hydrolyze into NaOH and HClO3. Wait, but NaOH is a strong base, not an acid. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. For example, Al2(SO4)3. When it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Al^3+ and SO4^2-; but that doesn't produce two acids. Alternatively, if C is a mixed salt.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfite. For example, Na2SO3. When hydrolyzed, it forms NaOH and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). So that would give one strong base and a weak acid. Not matching the two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate salt, like KClO3. When KClO3 reacts with water, does it produce anything? I think it's stable in water, but maybe upon heating, it decomposes. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. When it reacts with water, it slightly hydrolyzes to form NaOH and CO2. CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid when dissolved in water). But again, that's one strong base and a weak acid. Not two acids.

Hmm, maybe I should think about C being a diacid or something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal dichloride, like MgCl2. When it reacts with water, it just dissolves into Mg^2+ and Cl^- ions. Doesn't produce any acid.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. E is extremely hazardous. What could E be? Maybe a highly toxic gas like sarin, or perhaps something like phosgene? Or maybe a heavy metal compound.

Alternatively, considering D reacts with B to form H, which is a solvent. Let's think about possible D and B combinations.

If B is Cl2 and D is H2O, then H would be HCl (but that's a gas, not a solvent). Alternatively, if D is H2O (as gas) and B is Cl2, then H would be HCl. But that doesn't fit because H is a solvent, which would require it to be a liquid.

Wait, another possibility: D is NH3 gas, and B is Cl2. Reacting Cl2 with NH3 in a 1:1 ratio. Cl2 + NH3 → NH2Cl + HCl. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's a stable product, and it's not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe D is CCl4, but that's a liquid already, not a gas.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then, H would be H2O, which is a solvent. So D is H2, B is O2. So in the fourth reaction, O2 + H2 → H2O (with a 1:1 ratio in terms of moles? No, because 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, so it's actually a 2:1 ratio. So this doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio given in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is per molecule. So one molecule of B reacts with one molecule of D. So if B is O2 (O=O), and D is H2 (H-H), then per molecule, O2 + H2 would form 2 H2O molecules. So 1 O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. So that's a 1:2 ratio, which doesn't fit the 1:1 given. So that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I should think of B as Cl2 and D as H2O. So Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But the ratio isn't 1:1 if considering the stoichiometry. Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. That's a 1:1 ratio, so one mole of Cl2 reacts with one mole of H2O to produce one mole each of HCl and HOCl. So H would be a mixture, but that doesn't make sense because H is supposed to be a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps H is a different product.

Wait, maybe B is another diatomic gas. Let me think about other possibilities. If B is O3 (ozone), but that's less likely. Alternatively, maybe B is N2O, but that's a gas. Hmm.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to think of E. E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of D. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous compounds? Maybe phosgene (COCl2), sarin gas, or perhaps something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but those are typically produced from different reactions.

Alternatively, if C is a chlorate (like KClO3) and D is something like H2SO4, then perhaps the reaction produces KClO4, but that's not dangerous. Alternatively, maybe it's a reduction reaction. For example, C could be a chlorate, and D could be H2, leading to the formation of Cl^- or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate. Then, when it reacts with D (maybe H2), it could form NH4NO3 or something, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide, and D is a reducing agent. For example, if D is H2, then C (oxide) + H2 → metal + H2O. But then E would be the metal, which isn't extremely hazardous unless it's something like mercury, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, if C is a high-valent metal oxide, like MnO4^- (permanganate), and D is something like H2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a heavy metal compound, like mercury(II) chloride, but I'm not sure how that would form.

Another angle: the reaction C + 2 D → E. Maybe C is a diatomic molecule, and D is another diatomic gas. For example, C is Cl2O7 (dichloride pentaoxide?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate, and D is something else. Not making much progress here.

Let me think again about the third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So if F is HCl (strong) and G is H2CO3 (weak), then C could be something like NaClCO3 (sodium chlorocarbonate?), but I'm not sure if that's a real compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed carbonate and chloride.

Wait, maybe C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2 reacts with water to form NaOH and O2. But O2 is a gas, not an acid. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. When Na2SO3 reacts with water, it doesn't hydrolyze much, but maybe under certain conditions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride salt, like Ca3N2. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base) and Ca(OH)2. Again, not acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate of a metal that forms a strong acid upon hydrolysis. For example, Al2(SO4)3. When it dissolves in water, it gives H2SO4 (strong acid) and Al(OH)3 (which is amphoteric). But Al(OH)3 isn't an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal chloride that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong acid and another acid. Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When it hydrolyzes, it produces KCl (which is neutral) and ClO3^- in water, which is not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a metal hypochlorite, like NaClO. When NaClO reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form NaOH and HOCl (hypochlorous acid, which is weak). So in that case, F would be NaOH (strong base, not acid) and G would be HOCl (weak acid). But the problem states that F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts. Not sure.

Wait, maybe F and G are not the hydrolysis products but the result of decomposition. For example, C could be a metal carbonate and a chloride. When reacted with water, it might release CO2 (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid). So C could be something like NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate), but when it reacts with water, it doesn't produce anything else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixture of salts. For example, if C is CaCl2·2H2O, which when heated produces anhydrous CaCl2 and water. But that's not relevant here.

This is getting frustrating. Maybe I should think about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. These are all point groups. So knowing the structure of E would help determine its symmetry.

D∞h is the symmetry group of a molecule with an infinite axis of rotation (like a diatomic molecule with a center of inversion and other symmetry elements). For example, O2, N2, Cl2 have D∞h symmetry.

C2 is a molecule with a single twofold axis of rotation.

D4h is a higher symmetry group, like square planar molecules (like XeF4) or octahedral with certain symmetry.

C2v is a group with a twofold axis and two vertical mirror planes.

So, if E is a diatomic molecule, it would be D∞h. If it's a linear molecule with certain symmetry, maybe.

But if E is a product of a reaction involving C and D, perhaps E is a diatomic gas. Let's think about what E could be.

Wait, another angle: the reaction C + 2 D → E. If D is H2, then E might be a metal (if C is a metal oxide). But that doesn't match the extremely hazardous part.

Alternatively, if D is Cl2, and C is something else, perhaps E is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure of O=C(Cl)2. Its molecular symmetry is D∞h because it's a linear molecule with two identical substituents on either side of the central carbon, which has a mirror plane and a center of inversion. So the symmetry group would be D∞h.

So if E is phosgene, then the symmetry group is D∞h. Let's see if the reactions fit.

Phosgene is produced from the reaction of chlorides, often from the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with a base, but I'm not sure if that fits the given reactions.

Alternatively, phosgene can be produced by the reaction of carbon disulfide with chlorine in the presence of a catalyst. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is COCl2, and D is something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chloroformate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorate. Let me think. C is formed from A and 8 B. If B is Cl2, then C could be a polychloride. For example, if A is a metal like sodium, 8 Cl2 would make NaCl8? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chlorate like Ca(ClO3)2. Then, when C reacts with D (maybe H2), it could produce something else. Not sure.

Wait, going back to the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. If B is Cl2, then 8 moles of Cl2 would react with 1 mole of A. Each Cl2 gives 2 Cl-, so 8 Cl2 gives 16 Cl-. So the formula of C would be ACl16? That seems unlikely. Metals typically form +1, +2, or +3 charges. So if A is a +2 cation, then ACl8 would be the formula (A²+ and 8 Cl^-). So C could be ACl8, which would be a solid. But what metal forms a chloride with eight chlorides?

Wait, perhaps it's not a simple metal chloride but a complex ion. Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a high oxidation state chloride. For example, if A is Ru (ruthenium), which can form RuCl8^4−. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a chloro complex. For example, [FeCl4]^- is a common complex, but that would require less Cl- per A.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that E is COCl2 (phosgene) and thus has a symmetry group of D∞h.

So the options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

If E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)₂), its structure is linear with a central carbon, so it has a D∞h symmetry.

So the correct answer would be option C) D∞h.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the identification of the molecular symmetry group of product E. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. This suggests that A is likely a metal or a compound that reacts with B in a high ratio to form a red product. A plausible candidate for B is Cl₂, as it is a common diatomic gas, and the reaction could form a chlorinated compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. This implies that E is likely a toxic compound. A highly hazardous compound fitting this description is phosgene (COCl₂), which is a linear molecule.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests that C is a compound that can hydrolyze to produce a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a chlorinated compound, it could hydrolyze to form HCl (strong acid) and another weak acid.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. If B is Cl₂, D could be H₂O, as it reacts with Cl₂ in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl (a gas) and HOCl (a weak acid). However, H is stated to be a solvent, which aligns with H₂O as a solvent under certain conditions.

5. **Symmetry Group of E**: If E is phosgene (COCl₂), its structure is linear with a central carbon atom bonded to two chlorine atoms and one oxygen atom. This linear structure has a molecular symmetry group of **D∞h**, which includes a twofold rotation axis, a center of inversion, and two vertical mirror planes.

Given the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
