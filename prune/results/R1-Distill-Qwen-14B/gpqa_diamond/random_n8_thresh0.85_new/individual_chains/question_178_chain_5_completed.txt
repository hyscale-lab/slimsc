Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ, and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism or another gauge field. So this looks like some kind of interaction term between a spinor field (like electrons) and a gauge field (like photons).

Wait, but first, what's the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian? Because the Lagrangian itself has mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions, right? Because the action is dimensionless (in natural units), and it's the integral of L, which has dimensions [L]^4. So L must have dimension 4.

The Lagrangian term here is L_int, which is part of the full Lagrangian. So each term must have dimension 4.

Let me break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's think about the dimensions of each field.

In 4 dimensions, the fields have certain mass dimensions. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2 because the action for a free Dirac field is ∫ ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ d^4x. The term iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ has to have dimension 4, so ψ has dimension 3/2 because ∂_μ has dimension 1. So ψ̄ would also have dimension 3/2.

The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from a gauge field A, which in electromagnetism is a U(1) gauge field. The field strength is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So A has dimension 1 because ∂ has dimension 1. Therefore, F^{μν} would have dimension 2, since it's two derivatives acting on A (each derivative is dimension 1, so two gives dimension 2).

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices and is antisymmetric. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Putting it all together, the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} should have dimension 4. Let's see:

Each ψ̄ and ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. σ is dimensionless, so that's still 3. Then F has dimension 2, so 3 + 2 =5. But we have κ multiplying all that. So the total dimension is [κ] + 3 +2 = [κ] +5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so [κ] +5 =4 => [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would point towards options A or C, since those have [κ]=-1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constant. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension should be non-negative. Wait, right, because in the renormalization group equations, the dimension tells you the superficial degree of divergence. If the coupling has a negative mass dimension, that means the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (UV divergences), leading to the theory being non-renormalizable.

Wait, the general rule is that a renormalizable interaction must have a coupling with mass dimension ≤4 in 4d. Wait no, more precisely, the dimension of the coupling is determined by the interaction term. For a term like L = g φ^n, the dimension of g is [g] = 4 - n*(mass dimension of φ). So if [g] ≥0, the term is renormalizable. Because if [g] is negative, the term is non-renormalizable.

Wait in this case, our coupling is κ. So [κ]=-1, which is less than zero. So the interaction is non-renormalizable. So the theory isn't renormalizable.

Looking back at the options: A says [κ]=-1, and theory is renormalizable. That's wrong. C says [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. That fits.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the fields
In 4 spacetime dimensions:
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$, derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term, being a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, is dimensionless.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. Breaking down the term:
- $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi$ has mass dimension $[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes an additional dimension of 2.
- Thus, the total dimension of $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is $[\kappa]_M + 3 + 2 = [\kappa]_M + 5$.
- Setting this equal to 4 (the required dimension of the Lagrangian), we solve $[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1$.

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constant has a non-negative mass dimension. Here, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This implies the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, leading to ultraviolet divergences. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option **C**.
