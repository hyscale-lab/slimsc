Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics yet. But I'll give it a shot. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

So the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is equal to 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Wait, but what are we calculating here? The question asks for the energy of the RHIC. I think that in colliders, the energy typically refers to the kinetic energy of the particles. But wait, sometimes people use total energy, which includes rest mass energy. I need to clarify that. The problem says "energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the kinetic energy each nucleus is accelerated to. Or, perhaps, the total energy. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed and see where it takes me.

Let me jot down the variables:

v = 0.96c
c = speed of light
m = rest mass of the nucleus X (Li-6)

First, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass of the electrons, but wait, for a nucleus, the electrons are part of the atom. Oh wait, no, in a nucleus, the electrons are separate. Wait, no, the rest mass of the nucleus X is just the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Or is there a binding energy consideration? Hmm, but since we're dealing with relativistic energies, maybe the binding energy is negligible compared to the kinetic energy. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as the sum of its nucleons' masses.

Wait, but the exact mass of Li-6, I should probably look it up, but since I don't have that luxury, perhaps I can approximate it. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the atomic mass unit (u) and convert it into energy via E=mc². Let me think about the steps.

So, first, determine the rest mass of the nucleus. Let's see: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 GeV/c² (but wait, I remember that 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c². So protons are about 1.007 u each. Wait, but maybe I should get exact numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the exact mass and just proceed with variables, but I don't think so. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think: the standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.941 g/mol, but that's for the isotope Li-7. Li-6 has a lower mass. Alternatively, maybe I can get the mass of Li-6 in terms of u.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.016 u. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.94, but that's a mix of isotopes. For Li-6, each has a mass of about 6.016 u. Yes, I think that's right.

So, the rest mass m is 6.016 u. Converting that to GeV/c². Since 1 u is approximately 0.931494 GeV/c². So m = 6.016 * 0.931494 GeV/c².

Let me compute that:

6.016 * 0.931494 ≈ Let's compute 6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964. Then, 0.016 * 0.931494 = approximately 0.0149039. So total is about 5.6038679 GeV/c². Let me double-check: 6 * 0.931494 is 5.588964, adding 0.016*0.931494=0.0149039 gives 5.6038679 GeV/c².

So m = 5.6038679 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait a second. The rest mass energy is mc², so in terms of units, when using GeV, the c² is already included because mass is in GeV/c². So when we compute the energy, E = gamma * m c². But in terms of units where c=1, E (in GeV) would be gamma * m (GeV/c²) * c² (which is (GeV/c²)*(c²) = GeV). So yes, E = gamma * m.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: The rest energy is mc², which is (5.6038679 GeV/c²) * c² = 5.6038679 GeV. So when we multiply by gamma, the total energy is gamma * 5.6038679 GeV.

But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. In colliders, the energy is usually the kinetic energy. So is the question asking for the total energy (including rest energy) or the kinetic energy? That's a crucial point. The wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." Hmm. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, and their energy is typically given as their kinetic energy. So perhaps the question is seeking the kinetic energy K.

Alternatively, sometimes the total energy (gamma * mc²) is used. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. For protons in the LHC, the energy is given as the proton's kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. No, wait, the LHC's energy is the total energy (gamma * mc²), which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But I'm a bit confused about RHIC's convention.

Wait, looking up (in my mind), I remember that in particle physics, when they say the beam energy, it's usually the kinetic energy. But sometimes, it's the total energy. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think: for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the energy given is the total energy, but I'll proceed and see which option makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total energy, so E = gamma * m c².

So, let me proceed with that approach. Let's compute gamma first.

Given v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, (v/c) = 0.96.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So, gamma = 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Hmm, let me compute that more accurately. 0.28 is 7/25, so sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(7*7/(25*25*100)) )? Wait, 0.0784 is 784 * 1e-4, so sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * (5.6038679 GeV) ≈ let's compute that.

3 * 5.6038679 = 16.8116.
0.5714 *5.6038679 ≈ Let me compute 5.6038679 * 0.5 = 2.80193, and 5.6038679 * 0.0714 ≈ approx 5.6038679 *0.07=0.392, and 5.6038679 *0.0014≈0.007845. So 0.392 + 0.007845≈0.3998. So 2.80193 + 0.3998 = 3.20173.

So total E ≈ 16.8116 + 3.20173 ≈ 20.0133 GeV.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps my approximations have errors.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6038679 more accurately.

First, 3 *5.6038679 = 16.8116037.

Then, 0.57142857 *5.6038679.

Compute 5.6038679 *0.5 = 2.80193395.

5.6038679 *0.07142857 = let's compute 5.6038679 * 0.07 = 0.392270753.

5.6038679 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.007999999 (since 5.6038679 * 0.00142857 ≈ approx 0.008).

So sum is approximately 0.392270753 + 0.008 ≈ 0.400270753.

So total 0.5 part is 2.80193395, and 0.07142857 part is 0.400270753. Adding them gives 3.2022047.

So total E = 16.8116037 + 3.2022047 ≈ 20.013808 GeV.

Wait, but the options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, 20.0138 is close to 20.014 GeV, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the mass of Li-6 again. Maybe I should be using the exact value.

Wait, the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0160293 u. Let me confirm that. So 6.0160293 u.

Converting to GeV/c²: 1 u = 0.931494 GeV/c².

So 6.0160293 * 0.931494 = ?

Let me compute that accurately.

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.0160293 * 0.931494 = let's calculate:

0.01 * 0.931494 = 0.00931494.

0.0060293 *0.931494 ≈ Let's compute 0.006 *0.931494=0.005588964, and 0.0000293*0.931494 ≈ 0.00002727.

Adding these: 0.00931494 + 0.005588964 = 0.014903904 + 0.00002727≈0.014931174.

So the total is 5.588964 + 0.014931174 ≈5.603895 GeV/c².

So m =5.603895 GeV/c².

Now, E = gamma * m = 3.57142857 *5.603895 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 is 25/7, because 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So 25/7 *5.603895.

25 *5.603895 = 140.097375.

Divide by 7: 140.097375 /7 =20.0139107 GeV.

So E ≈20.0139 GeV.

That's approximately 20.0139 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is 0.118 GeV higher. Hmm. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recheck gamma.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v=0.96c, so v²/c² = 0.96² =0.9216.

1 -0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = approx 3.57142857.

Wait, that's correct. So gamma is correct.

So where is the mistake? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Because if E is the total energy, then the answer I get is ~
