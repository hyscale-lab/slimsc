Okay, so I've got this pretty detailed question here about molecular biology techniques, specifically using loxP systems and Cre recombinase. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out.

So, the setup is that someone identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their interaction's developmental fate. They've created a bicistronic vector with lox-Cre. Wait, bicistronic means two coding regions in one vector, right? So the construct has two ORFs: one for the ligand and one for the receptor.

The vector details: ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then there's a stop cassette with loxP, so that's a stop signal between ligand and mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP, and has a stop cassette with lox2272. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element, so the promoter for the ligand probably drives both, with IRES allowing internal ribosome entry for the receptor.

They transfected this into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. Actin is a loading control. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. Cre is used for recombination. SOX10 is a transcription factor expressed in neural crest cells, so Cre would be active there.

The problem is that after the offspring are born, they looked under a confocal microscope for the fluorescent signals. They expected green (from eGFP) but didn't see it. So why no green signal?

Let me think about the possible options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the ligand is expressed by one cell and the receptor by another, would that affect the expression in the construct? The construct is bicistronic, so both should be expressed unless something is wrong with the expression cassettes. Not sure how this ties into the Western blot or the lack of GFP.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The receptor is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't get to the cell surface. So when they use Cre, maybe the construct is designed so that in the presence of Cre, the eGFP is expressed. But wait, the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection, not in the mouse. So in the mouse, perhaps the Cre is activated, which recombines the loxP and lox2272 sites. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. LoxP is the wild-type site, and lox2272 is a mutant that Cre can only recombine when it's in a certain configuration.

Wait, the vector setup: the ligand is first, with a stop in loxP-stop-loxP. The receptor is after IRES, with a stop in lox2272. So when Cre is present, it would recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stops. So in the presence of Cre, both ligand (with mCherry) and receptor (with eGFP) would be expressed.

But in the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So after Cre recombination, the constructs should be expressed. But in the Western blot after transfection, maybe the proteins were expressed. But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't showing up.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct, meaning both alleles have the loxP and lox2272 cassettes. So when they cross with SOX10-Cre, Cre should recombine the lox sites, allowing both proteins to be expressed in neural crest cells.

But in the microscopy, no green signal. Hmm. So why isn't the receptor-eGFP expressed?

Looking at the options again: option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the eGFP is not in frame, then a fusion protein wouldn't form, so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if that were the case, the Western blot might not show eGFP either. But the question states that they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on the blot. So if the eGFP isn't expressed, the Western would show no signal for it. But since the question says that the blot uses total proteins proportional to actin, maybe the proteins are expressed but not fluorescent? Not sure.

Wait, in the construct, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. So if the eGFP is not in frame, then the fusion protein isn't made, but the receptor might be expressed as a separate protein. But then, the antibodies would detect the receptor, but not the eGFP. But the question says they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, perhaps meaning both. Hmm, maybe not directly relevant.

Option B: if the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, then it's not on the cell surface, so the fluorescence wouldn't be visible. But if it's stuck, why would the eGFP not be processed? Wait, the receptor is a transmembrane protein; perhaps it's correctly processed, but the eGFP is a tag. Maybe the eGFP is causing misfolding, so it's retained in the ER or Golgi. But the question is about the presence of the signal.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES element is not working correctly. IRES allows for translation of the second ORF without the need for a second ribosome binding site. But IRES can sometimes be cell-type specific. If the astrocytes in culture are expressing the receptor, but in the mouse, perhaps the IRES isn't active, so the receptor isn't expressed. But why would the Western blot show expression?

Wait, in the Western blot, the eGFP might not be detected because the blot is for proteins, but eGFP is a fluorescent protein, not a tag that would be immunodetected unless they have an antibody against eGFP. Oh wait, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So maybe the construct includes epitope tags, like HA or FLAG, or perhaps the
