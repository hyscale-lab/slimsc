Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me try to work through this step by step.

The problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we're diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, first, I should probably figure out what's happening when we dilute the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we add water, its concentration decreases, which might affect its dissociation. But for now, let's think about the dilution first.

So the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. That makes a total volume of 40 cm³. The concentration of acetic acid after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Original concentration M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ (V2 is 40 cm³), the new concentration M2 is (0.05 *20)/(40) = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrated with NaOH (a strong base), the reaction will be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to acetate ions.

The question asks for two pH values: at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me tackle the equivalence point first because I think that's a bit simpler. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The acetate ions (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic.

But wait, how much of each solution are we using? Let me calculate moles first so I can find the equivalence volume.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.05 M, V = 0.02 L (20 cm³). Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. The reaction is 1:1, so moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 moles.

Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence: moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the problem is asking for the pH at 25% titration, which is 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, let's think about the 25% point. At this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has reacted. So, I can use the buffer equation (Henderson-Hasselbalch) here because it's a titration before the equivalence point and the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and its conjugate base.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the concentrations of the acid and conjugate base at that point.

Wait, let me calculate the moles. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH have reacted with NaOH, producing 0.00025 moles of CH3COO^-.

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining:
