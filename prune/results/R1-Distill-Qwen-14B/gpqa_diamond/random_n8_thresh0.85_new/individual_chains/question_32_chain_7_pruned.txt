Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I need to find the energy, and the options are given. Let's see how to approach this.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So natural lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that means the isotope is Li-6 because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, probably a deuteron? Wait no, deuterons are H-2. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so it's a light ion, but heavier than a proton.

RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so Li-6 would be a good candidate. Now, the question is about relativistic energy. The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula: E = γ * m * c², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

The problem states that the speed v is 0.96c. So we need to find γ when v = 0.96c. Let's recall the formula for gamma: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute that. Plugging in 0.96c:

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So γ is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. Subtracting from 1 gives 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, γ is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...

Now, the nucleus is Li-6, so its rest mass is needed. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus can be found by looking up the atomic mass. Alternatively, we can calculate the mass using the sum of protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But wait, is that right? Let me think. Oh wait, the mass of a neutron is slightly more than a proton because the binding energy is less in free neutrons. So for Li-6, it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total rest mass is 3*(mass of proton) + 3*(mass of neutron). Let me get the exact numbers. Proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, that's the mass of a
