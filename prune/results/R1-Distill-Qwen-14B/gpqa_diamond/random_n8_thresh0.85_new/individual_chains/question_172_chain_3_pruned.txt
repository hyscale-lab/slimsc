Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, no, wait. It says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level is higher in star_1. I think the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in an excited state relative to the ground state. 

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, 1.38 is Boltzmann's constant times temperature? Wait, noâ€”Boltzmann's constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, that's exactly what the energy difference is here. So delta E is k_B * something. Wait, delta E is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is k_B * T, if T is 1 K? Because k_B is 1.38e-23 J/K. So if delta E equals k_B * T, then delta E is about 1.38e-23 J for T=1 K. 

But the problem is about the ratio of the number of excited atoms in two stars. So using the Boltzmann factor, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: 

n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - delta E / (k_B T) )

Assuming that the energy levels have the same statistical weight (g), then the ratio simplifies to exp( - delta E / (k_B T) )^-1, because n_upper is proportional to exp( - delta E/(k_B T) ) when you take the lower level as the reference. Wait wait, no. Let me think again. The population ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k_B T) ). So for the same g, n2/n1 = exp( -(delta E)/(k_B T) ), where delta E is E2 - E1.

In the problem, n1 is the excited state and n2 is the ground state? Or vice versa? Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So I think n_excited in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Wait, no. Let me reread the question.

It says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Does this mean that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level? Or that the excitation is higher, so the ratio of n_upper to n_lower is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2? Oh, probably the latter. So for star_1, the excitation is higher, meaning that the ratio n_upper/n_lower is higher.

Let me denote for star_1: (
