Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Oh wait, right, because uncertainty is the square root of the variance. So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ>. Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means each component of |ψ> corresponds to an eigenstate of P_z. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z.

Looking at the matrix for P_z, it's diagonal. The eigenvalues are along the diagonal. So the first component corresponds to eigenvalue ℏ, the second to 0 (since the (2,2) entry is 0), and the third to -ℏ.

So the state |ψ> can be written as a combination of |+z>, |0z>, and |-z> states, right? Because the eigenstates of P_z are |+z>, |0z>, |-z>, with eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ respectively.

Wait, the components of |ψ> are (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So let me compute the probabilities. The first component is -1/2, so the coefficient squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. The second is 1/sqrt(2), squared is 1/2. Third is (-1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the probabilities sum to 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. That checks out.

So the expectation value <P_z> is the sum of each probability multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalue. So that's (1/4)*ℏ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ℏ) = (ℏ/4) - (ℏ/4) = 0. Oh, so <P_z> is zero.

Now I need to find <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, its square is just the squares of the eigenvalues. So the diagonal elements of P_z squared matrix are (ℏ)^2, 0^2, (-ℏ)^2, which are ℏ², 0, ℏ².

So the expectation value <P_z²> is the sum of each probability times the squared eigenvalue. So (1/4)*ℏ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ℏ² = (ℏ²/4 + ℏ²/4) = ℏ²/2.

So now, the variance is <P_z²> - <P_z>² = (ℏ²/2) - 0 = ℏ²/2. Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of that, which is sqrt(ℏ²/2) = ℏ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B
