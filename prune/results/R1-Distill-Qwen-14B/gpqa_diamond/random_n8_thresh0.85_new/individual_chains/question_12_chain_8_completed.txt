Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. It's about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies. 

The question states that a Pi(+) is stationary and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The task is to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Wait, so when a particle at rest decays, the total energy is conserved. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the Pi, since it's stationary. The products will have their rest masses plus kinetic energies. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think in particle physics, the neutrino's rest mass is often considered negligible compared to the other particles, especially in problems like this. So maybe I can approximate the neutrino's rest mass as zero. That would make things easier.

So, the decay equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The rest mass of Pi is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy would just be its kinetic energy plus any rest mass, which is almost nothing. So effectively, the neutrino's energy is approximately its kinetic energy.

Now, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must add up to zero. So the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the kinetic energy of the muon as K_mu and the neutrino as K_nu. The total energy of the muon is its rest mass plus kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. Similarly, the neutrino's total energy is E_nu = K_nu (since m_nu c² ≈ 0).

But wait, energy is conserved, so the sum of the energies of muon and neutrino equals the pion's rest mass energy. So, 139.6 MeV = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

And momentum is conserved. The momentum of the muon (p_mu) must equal the momentum of the neutrino (p_nu), but in the opposite direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

The energy-momentum relation for each particle is E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2. 

So for the muon: (E_mu)^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2.

And for the neutrino: (E_nu)^2 = (p_nu c)^2 + (m_nu c²)^2. But since m_nu is near zero, E_nu ≈ p_nu c.

But since p_mu = p_nu, let's say p. So p_mu = p_nu = p. 

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, units. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, as is common in particle physics. So E² = p² + m².

So E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ), and E_nu = p (since m_nu ≈ 0).

Now, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = m_pi = 139.6.

So substituting, sqrt( p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

This is one equation with one unknown p. Let me write it as:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now, I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

So, (sqrt(p² + 105.7²))² = (139.6 - p)^2.

Which becomes p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6*p + p².

The p² terms cancel out.

So, 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6*p.

Let me compute 105.7 squared and 139.6 squared.

105.7^2: 105 *105 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross terms 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let's compute 140^2 is 19600. 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So, substituting these numbers into the equation:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * p.

Let me compute the right-hand side:

RHS = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Bring the 19488.16 to left:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 p.

Compute 11172.49 - 19488.16:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = approximately 8315.67, so 11172.49 - 19488.16 = -8315.67.

So, -8315.67 = -279.2 p.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

p = (-8315.67) / (-279.2) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that:

279.2 * 29 = approx 279*30=8370, which is a bit higher. So 29*279.2=8096.8. 279.2*29.7=?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Well, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 = 8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2 * (30 - 0.3) = 8376 - (279.2 * 0.3) → 8376 - 83.76 = 8292.24.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29.7 = 8292.24.

Our numerator is 8315.67. 8315.67 -8292.24 = 23.43. So 23.43 / 279.2 ≈ 0.084.

So total p ≈ 29.7 + 0.084 ≈ 29.784. Let me call it approximately 29.78 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Now, we can find E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

Wait, wait, because E_nu = p c, but with c=1 in these units, so E_nu = p.

So K_nu is E_nu, because the neutrino's rest mass is zero. So K_nu ≈29.78 MeV.

But wait, the neutrino can't have more energy than the pion's rest mass minus the muon's rest mass. Let me check: 139.6 - 105.7 =33.9 MeV. So 29.78 is less than that, which makes sense.

Now, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Wait, plugging the numbers in:

E_mu = sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.78^2: approximately 886. So 29.78^2 = (30 -0.22)^2 = 900 - 2*30*0.22 + (0.22)^2 = 900 -13.2 + 0.0484 ≈ 886.848.

105.7^2 is 11172.49.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.848 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.338) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the pion's mass is 139.6 MeV. So 109.81 + 29.78 ≈ 139.59 ≈139.6, which checks out. So that's correct.

Now, the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Wait, 105.7 is the rest mass. So KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Similarly, the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon, and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino.

Looking at the options, option D is D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 'Find KE of product particles in...' So the question is, which product particles? So the products are the muon and the neutrino. So the KEs are 4.12 and 29.8, as per option D.

Wait, but wait, neutrinos have very little mass, so in reality, the neutrino's energy is almost entirely kinetic. So in our calculation, the neutrino's KE is 29.78, which is approx 29.8.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion (π⁺) into a muon (μ⁺) and a neutrino (ν). The rest masses of the π⁺ and μ⁺ are given as 139.6 MeV and 105.7 MeV, respectively. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is approximately equal to its kinetic energy. The goal is to determine the kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino.

### Conservation of Energy and Momentum
1. **Energy Conservation**: The total energy of the system is conserved. Initially, the energy is the rest energy of the pion:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]  
   Here, \(E_{\mu} = m_{\mu} c^2 + K_{\mu}\) (rest energy of the muon plus its kinetic energy), and \(E_{\nu} \approx K_{\nu}\) (since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Energy-Momentum Relation
Using the energy-momentum relation \(E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4\) (with \(c = 1\) in natural units), we write:
- For the muon:  
  \[
  E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
  \]
- For the neutrino:  
  \[
  E_{\nu} \approx p.
  \]

### Solving for \(p\)
From energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}.
\]  
Substituting \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}\), we solve for \(p\):
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Squaring both sides and simplifying:
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2(139.6)p.
\]  
Substituting \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\) and \(139.6^2 = 19488.16\), we solve for \(p\):
\[
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p.
\]  
Rearranging:
\[
p = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energies
1. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy**: Since \(E_{\nu} \approx p\),  
   \[
   K_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Muon's Kinetic Energy**: The total energy of the muon is:
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(29.78^2 = 886.848\) and \(105.7^2 = 11172.49\),  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.848 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.338} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.8 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
