Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

We've got a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, and we're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

The problem also gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, orthophosphate is the PO4^3- ion, right? So I need to compute the concentration of that in the solution.

First, I think about what each salt contributes. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium phosphate dihydrate, which I think dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in solution, these ions can undergo hydrolysis. Because the phosphate species can shift between H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- depending on the pH.

So the presence of both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 will affect the pH and the speciation of phosphate ions.

I remember that when a solution contains a weak acid and its conjugate base, it can form a buffer. So maybe this is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-?

Wait, but the problem is about PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form. So I need to find how much of the phosphate is in the PO4^3- form.

The first step should be to calculate the moles of each phosphate species in the solution.

Let me compute the moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4.

Moles of KH2PO4 = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007335 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005611 mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus the water, which doesn't contribute to the ions. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- per mole.

So, in the solution, the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005611 mol / 0.2 L ≈ 0.028055 M.

Now, these two species can interconvert via the second dissociation of H3PO4, which is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+.

The Ka2 for H3PO4 is 6.2e-8. Wait, but that's the Ka for H2PO4^- losing a proton to become HPO4^2-. So the equilibrium is H2PO4^- ⇌ HPO4^2- + H+.

So, the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- suggests this is a buffer solution. The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid.

Wait, in this case, the acid is H2PO4^- (since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-). So, the conjugate base is HPO4^2-.

Wait no, wait. Wait, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So the Henderson equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Yes, that's right. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) inverse? Wait, no. Wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(
