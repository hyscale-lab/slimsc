Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me think about what I remember about isomers, especially optical isomers.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each pairing some of the compounds. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chirality, meaning it has a non-superimposable mirror image. Chiral centers are key here; a molecule with at least one chiral center can be a candidate.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism because of the rotation around the central bond. Wait, but biphenyls usually don't have free rotation, right? Oh wait, wait. Biphenyls can have E and Z isomerism if there are substituents on each phenyl ring in such a way that the arrangement around the single bond can be different. But wait, optical isomerism is about chirality, not just geometric isomerism. So for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center or some kind of element that makes it non-superimposable.

In this case, the molecule is a dimethyl ester with substituents on each phenyl. The structure would have two ester groups and two nitro groups. Let me imagine the structure. The two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond. Each ring has an ester group at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6.

Wait, but the central single bond between the two benzene rings might allow for some kind of stereoisomerism. Like, if the substituents on each ring are in a specific arrangement that creates non-superimposable mirror images. Alternatively, maybe each ring has a chiral center?

Wait, the ester groups are OMe, so each is attached to the phenyl. The substituents on each ring are 2-COOCH3 and 6-NO2. Are any of the carbons in the biphenyl system chiral?

Wait, maybe the central C-C bond. If the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetric, could that lead to a chiral center? Or perhaps the ester groups are in positions that make the molecule chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system itself is a chiral center. Oh wait, biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when there's a restricted rotation around a single bond, causing the two substituents on each side to be in different configurations. For example, if each phenyl has two different substituents, then the arrangement around the single bond could lead to enantiomers.

So in this compound, each phenyl has a nitro group and an ester group. Let's see: each ring has a NO2 at position 6 and a COOCH3 at position 2. So each ring has two substituents. The central bond is between the two rings, and perhaps the arrangement of substituents on each ring leads to axial chirality.

Wait, but in biphenyls, axial chirality arises when the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule isn't flat or symmetric. So if both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, maybe the molecule is symmetric. But here, each ring has two substituents, but perhaps their arrangement leads to asymmetry.

Alternatively, maybe each ester group is connected to a carbon that could be chiral. Wait, the ester groups are in the 2 position of each phenyl. The structure is something like:

Phenyl-(C6H4)-COOCH3 and another phenyl-(C6H4)-NO2 at the 6 position. Hmm, perhaps each ester is attached to a carbon that's part of the aromatic ring, which isn't a chiral center. So maybe the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, but could have axial chirality.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Axial chirality refers to the arrangement of groups around a single bond. For biphenyls to have axial chirality, the two substituents on each ring must be different, and the arrangement must lead to non-superimposable mirror images.

In this case, each phenyl ring has two substituents: a nitro and an ester group. So the two substituents on each ring are in the 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So perhaps the two substituents on each ring are in the para positions relative to each other.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the substituents on each ring are in positions that allow the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are symmetric across the central bond, then the molecule might not be chiral. But if the substituents create an asymmetric arrangement, then axial chirality is possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry because both rings are identical in substitution. So if both rings have the same substituents (like each has NO2 at 6 and COOCH3 at 2), then the molecule is symmetric, and thus not chiral. So no optical isomerism here.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident about this, but maybe 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw that structure. The formula would be CH2(COOCH3)OH. Wait, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is (CH3CO)OCH2OH? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but in ester form, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, let me think again. The structure is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3. So the ester group is at the end, and the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the molecule would have a central carbon with OCH3 (from ester), OH, and two CH2 groups perhaps? Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the molecule would be:

The central carbon is the one attached to the hydroxyl and the ester. So the carbon chain is CH2-OH-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COO- with the methyl ester. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (the second carbon) has CH2OH and CH2COOCH3 attached. Wait, perhaps I'm
