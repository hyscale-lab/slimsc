Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Let me think.

Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance in parsecs (d) is the reciprocal of the parallax in arcseconds (plx), so d = 1/plx. Right, so as plx increases, the distance decreases because the star is closer.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would there be in that range.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their spatial density is uniform. So volume per unit volume is the same everywhere. So the number of stars depends on the volume of space a certain distance away.

Let me think about spherical shells. If I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dr. Since the distribution is uniform, the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume. So N ∝ 4πd² dr.

But the question is about parallax, so I need to express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dr is the change in distance, which would translate to a change in plx.

Wait, let me compute dr in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because as plx increases, d decreases. So the minus sign just indicates the direction, but for the volume, I think I can ignore the sign and focus on the magnitude.

So, substituting d = 1/plx into the volume expression. The volume of the shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is in terms of plx. Since dr = (1/plx²) dplx, but wait wait, no. Let me think of plx as a function of d. So plx = 1/d. So dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So solving for dd: dd = -d² dplx.

So the volume is 4π d² dr. But dr is a small change in d, which is from d to d + dr. Wait, no, the shell's volume is 4π d² dr, where dr is the thickness in distance.

But in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, the thickness dr would be expressed as a change in plx. Let me express the volume in terms of plx.

Given d = 1/plx, dr is the change in d, which is the same as the change in plx. Wait, no, because plx is 1/d, so if plx increases by dplx, then d decreases by (d^2) dplx. Wait, let me clarify.

Let me think in terms of differentials. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, d d = - (1/plx²) dplx. So d d = -(1/plx²) dplx. So, the change in d (dr) is equal to -(1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but the volume element is 4π d² dr. So substituting dr, the volume becomes 4π d² * ( -(1/plx²) dplx ). But since plx is positive, and d is positive, and the negative sign just indicates the direction (as plx increases, d decreases), but for the number of stars, we're concerned with the magnitude. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr (in distance) is proportional to d² dr. But in terms of plx, we can write that as d² ( -(1/plx²) dplx ), but since we're considering positive ranges, we can ignore the negative sign.

Wait, substituting d = 1/plx into d² dr: d² dr = (1/plx)^2 * (1/(plx^2)) dplx, because dr is (1/plx²) dplx?

Wait, no, earlier I found that dr = -(1/plx²) dplx. So substituting into d² dr gives (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx ). So that's (1/plx^4) dplx, but negative. So the magnitude is (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but that seems a bit conflicting. Let me try to re-examine.

The number of stars in a thin shell (at distance d) with thickness dr in distance is N = n * 4π d² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume). Since the distribution is uniform, n is a constant.

But we want the
