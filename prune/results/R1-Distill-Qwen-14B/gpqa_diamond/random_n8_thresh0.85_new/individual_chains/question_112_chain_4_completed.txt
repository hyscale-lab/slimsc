Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first thing, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the square of the amplitudes, and without normalization, the probabilities won't add up to 1.

Wait, the question says it's proportional, so I probably need to find the normalization constant. The state vector is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal eigenstates of the spin-z operator. So, the normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients' magnitudes.

Let me denote the coefficients: for |up> it's (1+i), and for |down> it's (2-i). The magnitude squared of each coefficient is |1+i|² and |2−i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: that's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. And |2−i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the question asks about the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix representation is A_ij. The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So, let me figure out what this operator looks like.

Wait, it's a 2x2 matrix because the state is two-dimensional (|up> and |down>). So in the computational basis (|up>, |down>), the matrix A is:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Because for i=j, it's 0, and for i≠j, it's ħ/2. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal.

Hmm, what's the significance of this matrix? It looks familiar. Oh, right! The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix. Because if I multiply the Pauli X matrix by ħ/2, I get exactly the A matrix given.

But wait, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are the states |+> and |->, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of the Pauli X matrix, just scaled by a factor.

So the operator in question is A = (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, which are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, the eigenstates of A are |+> and |->.

Wait, but to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the probability without diagonalizing, but I think expressing |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A is the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvectors of A and then project |alpha> onto them. Since A is proportional to σ_x, the eigenstates are the same as σ_x's.

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->. Let me compute the coefficients.

First, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed in terms of |+> and |->, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So, let me write |alpha> as a combination:

|alpha> = a |+> + b |->

To find a and b, I can take the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

a = < + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2))( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So,

a = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2-i)/sqrt(7) ) ) ]

Wait, because ( <up| + <down| ) acting on |up> is 1, and on |down> is 1. So,

a = (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i) + (2-i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Simplify numerator: (1+i +2-i) = 3. So,

a = (3) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, b = < - | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2))( <up| - <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

So,

b = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) - (2-i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1+i) -2 +i = (-1 + 2i)

Wait, let me compute (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) +2i.

So,

b = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

So now, a and b are the coefficients. The probability of measuring |+> is |a|^2, and |-> is |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. So that would be the probability for |+>.

Compute |b|^2: the numerator is (-1 +2i). The magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So |b|^2 is 5/(14) ≈0.357.

Wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357. So the probabilities are about 0.643 and 0.357.

Now, looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36. That seems to match. But wait, the options might have more precise numbers. Let me compute them exactly.

Compute 9/14: 14 is 14, 9/14 is exactly 0.6428571428... So approximately 0.643. Similarly, 5/14 is about 0.357.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. Hmm, close but not exact. Option D is 0.61, 0.29—no. Option B: 0.54, 0.46—no. Option C: 0.28, 0.72—no. So perhaps the first part is option A, but the other parts? Wait the question also asks for the average value of the operator.

So to find the expectation value of operator A, which is (ħ/2) σ_x.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (ħ/2) <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

Alternatively, since σ_x is represented by the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], we can compute <alpha| σ_x |alpha>.

Another approach: Since the expectation value of σ_x is (a b* - a* b) / something. Alternatively, since |alpha> is normalized, <σ_x> is 2 Re( a b* ), but wait, perhaps I should compute it more directly.

Alternatively, let me write |alpha> as a column vector. Since the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>, the vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2−i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, to compute <σ_x>, it's the expectation value of σ_x, which is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by σ_x multiplied by |alpha>.

Alternatively, compute it as the sum over the components:

<σ_x> = (alpha_up* alpha_down) + (alpha_down* alpha_up).

Because when you multiply the vector by σ_x, you swap the components, so when you take the inner product, the off-diagonal terms contribute.

Wait, let me think: |alpha> is [a; b], where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2−i)/sqrt(7).

σ_x is [[0 1],[1 0]], so σ_x |alpha> is [b; a].

Then, <sigma_x> = [a*, b*] [b; a] = a* b + b* a.

So, compute a* and b*:

a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7)
b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7)

So,

a* b = [(1 -i)/sqrt(7)] * [(2 -i)/sqrt(7)] = ( (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) ) /7

Wait, let me calculate numerator: (1)(2) =2, (1)(-i) =-i, (-i)(2)= -2i, (-i)(-i)=i²= -1.

So numerator: 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-i -2i) = 1 -3i.

Then, a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, b* a = [(2 +i)/sqrt(7)] * [(1 +i)/sqrt(7)] = [ (2)(1) + (2)(i) + i(1) +i(i) ] /7.

Compute numerator: 2 + 2i +i +i². i squared is -1. So 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So, b* a = (1 +3i)/7.

So, <sigma_x> = (1-3i)/7 + (1+3i)/7 = [ (1+1) + (-3i +3i) ] /7 = 2/7.

So, <sigma_x> is 2/7.

Therefore, the expectation value of A is (ħ/2) * (2/7) = ħ/7.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the average value is ħ/7.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option A: probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

So that matches what I got. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the probabilities. Because |a|² is 9/14 ≈0.642857, which is approximately 0.64, and |b|² is 5/14≈0.357, which is about 0.36 when rounded. So that matches option A.

Wait, but another thought: The operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. The expectation value is (ħ/2)(2/7) = ħ/7. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Alternatively, the expectation value could be computed using the original state. Let me see.

Alternatively, matrix representation of A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. So the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Expressed in component form:

alpha_up = (1+i)/sqrt(7)
alpha_down = (2−i)/sqrt(7)

So,

< A > = (alpha_up* alpha_down) * (ħ/2) + (alpha_down* alpha_up) * (ħ/2)
= (ħ/2) [ alpha_up* alpha_down + alpha_down* alpha_up ]

Which is the same as before. So same result.

So, putting it all together, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.643 and 5/14≈0.357, which would round to 0.64 and 0.36. And the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. So that's correct.


The problem involves an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize this state, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), with magnitudes squared |1+i|² = 2 and |2-i|² = 5. The total squared magnitude is 2 + 5 = 7, so the normalization factor is 1/√7. The normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down\rangle.
\]

The operator in question has a matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and 0 otherwise. This corresponds to \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), given by:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|up\rangle + |down\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|up\rangle - |down\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), the state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed in terms of these eigenstates. The coefficients \( a \) and \( b \) of \( |\alpha\rangle = a|+\rangle + b|-\rangle \) are calculated as:

\[
a = \langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
b = \langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the magnitudes squared of these coefficients:

\[
|a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Next, the expectation value of \( A \) is calculated. Since \( A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \alpha | \sigma_x | \alpha \rangle = a^* b + b^* a.
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \), we find:

\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(-1+2i)}{14} = \frac{1-3i}{14}, \quad b^* a = \frac{(2+i)(3)}{14} = \frac{1+3i}{14}.
\]

Adding these gives:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{1-3i}{14} + \frac{1+3i}{14} = \frac{2}{14} = \frac{1}{7}.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \sigma_x \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, the probabilities \( |a|^2 \approx 0.64 \) and \( |b|^2 \approx 0.36 \), along with the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \), match the values in option A.

**Answer: A**
