Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with Compound A. The goal is to figure out what Compound D is. Let's break it down.

First, looking at Compound A's proton NMR. It shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, what structures have such NMR signals?

A triplet for 6H at low ppm (0.9) usually suggests something like a methyl group adjacent to another CH2. Because in an NMR, splitting like a triplet would come from coupling with two neighboring protons. Also, 6H is a lot—maybe two methyl groups each attached to a CH2.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet suggests each of these protons is next to three others. Wait, no, the splitting depends on neighboring H's. If a quartet, each H is next to three equivalent H's. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like, if you have a -CH2-CH2- structure, the end CH2 would split into a triplet, and the middle would be a quartet?

Wait, but in the NMR, the quartet is for 4H. So maybe two sets of two CH2 groups. So perhaps the structure is something like (CH2CH2)₂ connected in a way that each CH2 is next to another.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a di-substituted cyclohexane or something similar. But let's think in terms of possible structures.

Wait, another approach. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests two methyl groups (each with 3H) attached to something that causes them to split into triplets. So they are adjacent to a CH2 group. Because a methyl group next to a CH2 would split into a triplet. Because each H in the CH2 would couple with the methyl's Hs.

Yes, so that makes sense. So if you have two methyl groups attached to a CH2, each would be a triplet. So the structure could be something like (CH2CH3)₂ connected in a way that the CH2s are next to each other.

Wait, perhaps it's more like a diethyl group. No, wait, diethyl would have more Hs. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to another ethyl group? No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is neopentyl or something else. Wait, no, neopentyl is (CH2C(CH3)3), but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative? Not sure. Let me think about the quartet again.

A quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So that's four Hs in a quartet. So each of these Hs is next to three equivalent Hs. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2 that's part of a larger structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)₂CH₂. No, that would be longer. Alternatively, maybe it's a 2-pentene structure or something else.

Wait, another thought: the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H is likely a pair of two CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is CH2CH2 adjacent to another CH2CH2? Or perhaps it's part of a ring.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the NMR. Let me think again. For the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H), maybe it's two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Each CH3 would be next to a CH2, which has two Hs. So the CH3 would be a triplet because each H in the adjacent CH2 would split the signal into a triplet. So each CH3 is next to a CH2 group.

So the structure could be (CH2CH3)₂X, where X is something else. Wait, but how does that fit with the quartet?

Alternatively, perhaps the two CH3 groups are connected to a central CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group. So like CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't sum up the Hs right.

Wait, maybe it's (CH2CH3)₂CH₂. Wait, that would have the middle CH2. The two CH2CH3 groups would each have their CH3 as triplets, and the middle CH2 would be split by adjacent groups.

Wait, let's think about the NMR data again. The triplet is for 6H, which is two CH3 groups. Each CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two Hs, so each CH3 becomes a triplet. So that fits.

The quartet is for 4H. So four Hs in a quartet. That suggests a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group. Because each CH2 in the middle would split into
