Okay, so I've got this science question here about the distribution of stars in the sky and how their number per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm. I'm a bit confused, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax of a star is the reciprocal of its distance in parsecs. So if a star's parallax is plx, then distance d = 1/plx. That makes sense.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. I'm not entirely sure what that implies for their positions. Uniform in what way? Oh, wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars in a given volume is the same everywhere. So if you consider a sphere of radius r, the number of stars inside it would depend on the volume. Since volume increases with the cube of the radius, the number of stars would go up with r^3. But wait, in this case, we’re dealing with parallax, not radius.

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance again. So plx = 1/d. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density of stars (stars per unit volume) is constant, say n. But wait, I'm not sure if uniform distribution in the sky means uniform in volume or something else. Oh, wait, no. If stars are uniformly distributed in the universe (assuming a large enough volume), then the number of stars in a spherical shell between distance d and d + dd would be n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dd.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So the parallax plx is 1/d. Let's make a substitution: d = 1/plx. So, if I have a thin shell in parallax space, like plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding change in d? Since d = 1/plx, the change in d (dd) would be the derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx. The derivative of 1/plx is -1/(plx)^2. So dd = -dplx/(plx)^2. Since d is positive, maybe I should take the absolute value, so dd = dplx/(plx)^2.

Now, the volume element in terms of parallax would be 4π d² dd. Substituting d =1/plx and dd = dplx/(plx^2), let's see:

d² = (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx².

So d² * dd = (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx would be n * 4π * (d² dd) ) = n *4π (dplx / plx^4).

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, per unit dplx, the number would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. The number per unit parallax range (dplx) would be n*4π (d² dd)/dplx, but I'm not sure I did that correctly. Or maybe the number per unit of plx is the density in terms of plx space. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the differential number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx.

So, considering the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² dd. But since d =1/plx, and dd = dplx/(plx^2), replacing gives N = n *4π (1/plx^2) (dplx / plx^2) ) = n 4π dplx / plx^4.

So the number per unit dplx would be N/dplx = 4π n / plx^4. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would suggest the number decreases as plx increases,
