Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an organic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, the base structure is probably something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an OCOOR group or something similar. So, esters have a carbonyl group, which would show a strong peak around 1700 cm-1 in IR. That's a key point.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Two are aromatic H's. Wait, so the aromatic ring has two substituents, but each substituent is probably influencing the neighboring H's. The question says two signals, which might mean that the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets of environments. Like maybe para-substituted, but wait, di-substituted could be para, meta, or ortho. But if it's para, the aromatic protons might be symmetrical, resulting in fewer signals. Wait, no. If it's para, the two substituents are opposite each other. Then, each substituent is next to two H's. But in that case, perhaps the aromatic protons would split into two groups. Like, each substituent is adjacent to two H's, but on either side. Hmm. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that make the ring have two different types of aromatic H's. But wait, in the case of para substitution, wouldn't the ring be symmetric, leading to equivalent H's? No, wait, perhaps the substituents are such that each is attached to the ring, but their positions cause the H's to split into two sets. For example, maybe each substituent is an ester group. Oh, but wait, no, the ring could be substituted with two ester groups, but maybe each is in a different position. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and another is something else, but the question says di-substituted, so two groups attached.

Wait, but the IR shows an ester group, so probably at least one ester substituent. But wait, maybe both substituents are esters? Or perhaps one is an ester and the other is another group. Hmm.

The NMR also has two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl H's are from double bonds. So, maybe there's an ester group attached to a vinyl group. Like an allyl ester or something. Wait, an ester is RCOOR', so if R has a vinyl group, then the protons on the vinyl would show up as specific signals.

The two –CH3 groups would come from, perhaps, the ester groups. Like, maybe each ester has a methyl group. Wait, but the options have varying numbers of carbons. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, let's imagine the structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents, which are both ester groups. So, perhaps something like two ester groups attached to the ring. Or maybe one ester and another group.

Wait, but the ester group is OCOOR. So, for each ester, the R could be a methyl group, which would give a –CH3 in the NMR. So if there are two ester groups, each with a methyl group attached, that would account for two –CH3 signals in the NMR. But wait, the NMR says two signals for –CH3, so perhaps they are equivalent. Hmm, but if they are attached to different environments, the –CH3 groups might be different. Or maybe they're the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Like, a substituent could be OCOCH2CH2CH3, but that's a longer chain. Wait, but the –CH3's in the NMR come from, perhaps, the ester's R groups. So if each ester has a methyl group, but if the substituents are the same, their –CH3's would be the same, so only one signal. But the NMR shows two signals for –CH3. So maybe the two substituents have different R groups in the ester, each with a methyl. Wait, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a methyl ester, and the other substituent is something else, like a vinyl group. No, wait, but the question says di-substituted, so two substituents, and the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. Each substituent would contribute its own sets of protons. So, if one substituent is an ester with a methyl group (like OCOCH3), and another substituent is a vinyl group attached to another ester, perhaps. But that seems a bit complicated.

Wait, let's think about the substituents in terms of their structure. For example, the substituents could be ester groups, each with a different R group. Let's say one substituent is OCOCH3 (methyl ester) and another is OCOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester). Then, the –CH3 from the methyl ester would be a singlet in the NMR, and the –CH2 from the ethyl would split into something else, but the problem says no –CH2 signals. Wait, the question says there are no –CH2 groups, so perhaps the substituents don’t have –CH2. So maybe each substituent's R is a methyl group. But that would lead to two –CH3 groups, but if both are the same, perhaps they are equivalent, leading to a single peak. But the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that each substituent is a methyl group attached in a way that causes their –CH3 to be different. But that doesn't make sense because methyl groups are usually equivalent in symmetric situations.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not both esters. Let me think. If one substituent is an ester and another is a vinyl group. But the vinyl would have –CH2–CH2–? No, the vinyl is a double bond, so maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached. Like, maybe the ester is part of a vinyl group.

Wait, let me consider the NMR signals again. There are two vinyl H signals: one doublet and another doublet of quartets. Vinyl H's in a trans configuration might show as doublets if adjacent to another group. Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl is part of a substituent.

Another approach: Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. For the formula, each degree is either a ring or a double bond. The aromatic ring gives three degrees (three double bonds in benzene? No, benzene has three double bonds, so three degrees). Wait, actually, each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene (C6H6) has 6C +6H, but the formula is C6H6, so the degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14-6)/2=4. So 4 degrees: three from the ring (each double bond is one) and one for the ring itself? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Actually, benzene has three double bonds and one ring, but that's a total of three double bonds (each is a degree) and the ring is another degree? No, no. Wait, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For benzene (C6H6): (12+2-6)/2 =8/2=4. Each double bond and each ring contribute one. So benzene has three double bonds and one ring, but that's four degrees. Wait, but how? Because a ring is like a double bond in terms of degree. So each ring or pi bond is a degree.

So the compound given is di-substituted, so the ring is already in the structure. Let's think about the substituents. The substituents could contribute more degrees of unsaturation. For example, an ester group (RCOOR') has a carbonyl group (a double bond), so that's one degree. So each ester substituent adds one degree. If there are two ester substituents, that's two more degrees, making a total of 6 (aromatic ring 4, two substituents each adding 1: 4+2=6). Let's see if that holds.

Wait, but the formula would have to have that number. The options are C11H12O2, etc. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Take option D: C11H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2*11 +2 -12)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So 6 degrees. The aromatic ring contributes 4 (3 from the ring, 1 from each substituent?), wait, no. Wait, the aromatic ring itself has 4 degrees (as benzene), and each substituent with a double bond (like an ester's carbonyl) adds another. So, if the compound has two substituents each with a double bond (like two ester groups), that would give 4 (ring) + 2 (substituents) =6. So the degrees of unsaturation match.

So the formula must have 6 degrees. Let's check each option:

A) C11H14O2: (2*11+2-14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. So 5 degrees. But we need 6. So A is out.

B) C12H14O2: (2*12+2-14)/2= (26-14)/2=6. So B has 6 degrees. Possible.

C) C12H12O2: (24+2-12)/2=14/2=7. So 7 degrees.

D) C11H12O2: as before, 6 degrees.

So the options B and D have 6 degrees. So the correct formula must be either B or D.

Now, let's think about the structure.

The aromatic ring is di-substituted, with two substituents that are ester groups. So each substituent is OCOOR. The R groups here would add to the molecular formula.

Each ester group is OCOOR. So each substituent adds (O2C-O-R). Wait, no, each ester is RCOOR', so each is R-O-CO-O-R'? No, the ester is RCOOR', so for each substituent, the formula would be OCOOR'.

Wait, the substituent would be an ester group, so for the substituent, say, O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the ring as O-CO-O-R? No, the ester is an acyl group attached via an oxygen. Wait, the structure is Ar-O-CO-R, where Ar is the aromatic ring. Or Ar-CO-O-R.

Wait, no. The ester group is RCOOR'. So when attached to the ring, the structure would be Ar-O-CO-R', where Ar is the aromatic group, O is the connecting oxygen, and R' is the other part of the ester. So for example, if R' is methyl, the substituent is O-CO-OCH3.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The ester group is RCOOR', where R is attached to the oxygen, and R' is the other part. So, when the ester is attached to the aromatic ring, the structure is Ar-O-CO-R', where R' is the other group, like methyl.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would contribute an oxygen, so the formula would have O2 per substituent (since each ester has two oxygen atoms in the O-CO-O part).

Wait, but the compound has two ester substituents. So the formula would have O2 from each substituent, but wait, no. Each ester substituent adds an O from the ring attachment, another O from the carbonyl, and another O from the OR' group. So each substituent contributes 3 O's? No, because the ester group is O-CO-O, so that's three O's in the substituent, but the ring is already part of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps each substituent is an ester group with formula OCOOR. So each substituent adds 2 O's (because OCOOR has two O's in the carbonyl and the ester oxygen). Wait, no, OCOOR has three O's: O in the ester linkage, O in the carbonyl, and O in OR.

Wait, no. The ester group is RCOOR', so the formula is R-O-CO-R', but in that case, each substituent adds two O's (the ester oxygen and the carbonyl oxygen). For each substituent, it's OCOOR', which has two O's? Or three? Let me count: O in RCOO, O in O-R'. So RCOOR' has two O's from the ester group. So for each substituent, the O's added are two. But wait, the overall formula of the compound includes all the O's from substituents.

But the given formula options have O2. So the compound has two oxygen atoms. If each substituent is an ester group, and each contributes two O's, then two substituents would contribute four O's. But the formula is O2, so that can't be. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps each substituent contributes one O. So perhaps each substituent is a methoxy group, but that's not an ester. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the ester group has the formula RCOOR'. So each ester group contributes two O's (the OR' and the carbonyl O). So, for two ester substituents, that's 2 substituents * 2 O's each = 4 O's. But the formula given has O2. So this suggests that the substituents cannot both be esters. Hmm, so perhaps only one of the substituents is an ester, and the other is something else that contributes O's.

Wait, but the IR shows ester groups, so at least one ester is present. Could the other substituent also contribute an O? For example, a methoxy group (OCH3), which has one O. Then, the total O's would be 2 (ester) + 1 (methoxy) =3. But the formula has O2. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the substituents are not both esters, but other groups.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is an ester (O2) and the other is a vinyl group (which doesn't add O's). So total O's in the compound would be 2 (from ester) + 0 (vinyl) = 2, which matches the formula. That would work.

But wait, the IR shows the presence of an ester group, but nothing about vinyl groups. So perhaps the structure is such that one substituent is an ester group (O2), and the other substituent is a vinyl group (like a CH2CH2 group, but that would have H and possibly CH2 groups, but the NMR says no –CH2 signals. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group that includes a methyl. Let's think again.

Another possibility: one substituent is an ester group (like OCOCH2CH3, which would have a –CH2CH3 group, but that includes –CH2, which the NMR says there are no –CH2 signals. So that can't be. So perhaps each substituent is a methyl ester, like OCOCH3. So each substituent is OCOCH3.

Each substituent would contribute O2 and a –CH3 group. So two substituents: each has O2 and –CH3. So the total O's would be 2*2=4, but the formula has O2. So that can't be.

Wait, but the overall formula is O2, so perhaps the substituents contribute O's but the rest of the structure also has O's. Wait, no, the ring is just C6H4 (since it's di-substituted), so the ring contributes nothing to O. Therefore, substituents must contribute all O's. So if the formula is O2, the substituents can't contribute more than that.

So, possible scenario: one substituent is an ester (O2) and the other substituent is something else that doesn't add O's. So total O's would be 2.

Wait, but the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So maybe the ester has a –CH3, and the other substituent has another –CH3. So each substituent has a –CH3 group.

So, the two substituents are RCOOCH3 and something else with a CH3. But wait, the substituents can't add more than O2, so the other substituent shouldn't add any O's. Let's think: maybe the other substituent is a methyl group attached via a double bond, like a vinyl group. Wait, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester (O2) and a vinyl group (like CH2CH2, but that's not possible). Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a methyl group attached to the ring. But a methyl group doesn't have any O's, so that would keep the total O's at O2 (from the ester). That could work.

So, let's say the structure is a di-substituted benzene ring with one substituent as a methyl ester (O2) and another substituent as a methyl group. But wait, that would mean the substituents are OCOCH3 and CH3. Then, the NMR would show two –CH3 groups: one from the ester (as –O–CO–O–CH3) and another from the methyl substituent. So two –CH3 signals, which matches the NMR.

But wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two signals. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The aromatic H's would be split into two signals. So, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic H's would be equivalent, giving a single signal. But the NMR shows two signals, so perhaps the substituents are in ortho or meta positions, leading to two different sets of aromatic H's.

Wait, but then we have two substituents: one is a methyl ester (O–CO–OCH3) and another is a methyl group (CH3). So, if they are in positions that break the symmetry, the aromatic H's would show two signals. For example, if the substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions (ortho), or 1 and 3 (meta). Either way, the aromatic H's would split into two sets.

But wait, the NMR also shows two vinyl H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, the structure must have a vinyl group. So, perhaps one substituent is a methyl group, and the other is an ester that's part of a vinyl group. Hmm, but how?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Like, the substituent is OCOCH2CH2CH3, but that includes –CH2 groups, which aren't present in the NMR. So maybe the ester is part of a vinyl group, like OCOCH2CH2, but that would have –CH2 again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. For example, the substituent is OCOCH2CH2X, where X is another group. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like OCOCH2CH2–, but that's a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester and another substituent is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O... No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester (like OCOCH3) and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH–). But then, the vinyl group would have H's, which would show up as the two signals in the NMR.

Wait, let's think about the NMR signals for the vinyl H's. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. That could happen if the vinyl H's are adjacent to another group, perhaps another substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzene with one substituent being an ester group (like OCOCH3) and the other substituent being a vinyl group attached to another ester. Or perhaps the substituent is an ester group with a vinyl chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an allyl ester. For example, substituent is OCOCH2CH=CH2. But that would have a CH2 and a CH group, but the NMR doesn't show any –CH2 signals. So this might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester attached to a vinyl group. Let me think: the substituent would be OCOCH2CH2–, but again, that has –CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methacrylate group, like OCOCH2CH2–. Hmm, but again, –CH2 is present.

Wait, another thought: the two substituents are both ester groups, but one is a methyl ester and the other is another ester group without a CH2. Like, one substituent is OCOCH3 and the other is OCOCH2CH2CH3. But that would introduce –CH2 groups, which the NMR says are absent. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester and a vinyl group, but the vinyl group is part of a substituent that doesn't have –CH2. Wait, but how? Vinyl is CH2=CH–, which has –CH2 in the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, like CH2=CHCH2–, but again, that has –CH2.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a geminal di-substitution, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acrylate group, like OCOCH2CH=CH2. But that still has –CH2 groups.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this differently.

The NMR has six signals: two aromatic, two vinyl, two –CH3. So that's 2+2+2=6 signals. So each of these groups has distinct H environments.

The aromatic H's are split into two signals. So maybe the substituents are in such positions that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

The vinyl H's: one is a doublet, another is a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, in a vinyl group, each H is adjacent to another H, leading to a doublet. But if one of the vinyl H's is also adjacent to another substituent, perhaps leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. So, for example, the substituent is OCOCH2CH=CH2. But that would have –CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like OCOCH2CH2–, but again, –CH2 is present.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an allyl ester, like OCOCH2CH=CH2. But that would have –CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show. So this is confusing.

Wait, another approach: the vinyl H's could be part of a styryl group, like a benzene ring with a substituent that's a vinyl group connected to another aromatic ring. But that would be a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached directly to the ring, like benzene with a substituent CH2=CH–X, where X is another group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methacryloyl group. Methacryloyl is CH2=CHCO–, so the substituent would be OCOCH2CH=CH2. But that brings back the –CH2 groups.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the molecular formula.

Assuming that the correct formula is either B (C12H14O2) or D (C11H12O2). Let's calculate the molecular formulas for each structure.

If the structure is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents, each substituent would add their molecular formula.

Suppose one substituent is an ester (like OCOCH3) and another substituent is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH–R).

Wait, but the vinyl group would need to have something attached. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like OCOCH2CH2–, but that brings in –CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps both substituents are ester groups, each with a methyl group. So each substituent would be OCOCH3. Then the substituents would add 2*(O2C-O-CH3). So each substituent brings O2 and a –CH3.

But then, the total formula would be C6H4 [the ring] plus 2*(COOCH3). Let's calculate that.

Each COOCH3 is (COOCH3) → C: 1 (COO) + 1 (CH3) = 2 C per substituent. So two substituents add 4 C. Plus the ring's 6 C → total 10 C. But the options have 11 or 12 C.

Hmm, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps one substituent is a larger group.

Alternatively, suppose one substituent is OCOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester) and the other is OCOCH3 (methyl ester). Then, the substituents would contribute:

First substituent: OCOCH2CH3 → adds 3 C (the CH2CH3)
Second substituent: OCOCH3 → adds 2 C (the COOCH3)

So, substituents add 3 + 2 =5 C. The ring is 6 C → total 11 C. So the molecular formula would be C11H?O2.

Wait, let's compute the H:

Benzene ring: C6H4 → 4 H.

Each substituent: OCOCH2CH3 has 5 H (CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H?), wait no: OCOCH2CH3 is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. The CH2CH3 has 2+3=5 H. Wait, no, the CH2CH3 is an ethyl group, which has 2+3=5 H? No, wait, ethyl is CH2CH3, which has 2 H on the first CH2 and 3 H on the CH3 → total 5 H per substituent.

Wait, no: the substituent is OCOOCH2CH3? No, the substituent is OCOCH2CH3. So the ethyl group is attached to the O of the ester. So, the substituent is O-CO-O-CH2CH3. Wait, no, the ester is RCOOR', so substituent is O-CO-O-R', where R' is ethyl.

So, substituent OCOOCH2CH3 would have R' as ethyl. But the substituent would contribute 2 O's (from the ester group) and the ethyl group (5 H). So, each substituent adds the ethyl H's.

Wait, but the ring is C6H4, so 4 H. The substituents add 5 H (from ethyl) and 3 H (from methyl OCOOCH3 substituent). Wait, no, the methyl substituent is OCOOCH3, which has a –CH3, which has 3 H.

Wait, let me compute for the two substituents:

Substituent 1: OCOOCH2CH3 → adds 5 H (from ethyl)
Substituent 2: OCOOCH3 → adds 3 H (from methyl)
So total H from substituents: 5 +3 =8 H.

Plus the ring's 4 H → total H =12.

But the molecular formula would be C6 + substituent carbons.

Substituent 1: OCOOCH2CH3 → (COO) is 2 C, and CH2CH3 is 2 C → total 4 C.
Substituent 2: OCOOCH3 → COO is 2 C, CH3 is 1 C → 3 C.
Total substituent C: 4 +3 =7 C. Ring is 6 → total C=13? But the options are up to C12. So this can't be.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me think about the degree of unsaturation again.

The correct formula must have 6 degrees of unsaturation. So options B and D have that.

Now, for option D: C11H12O2.

The molecular formula is C11H12O2.

The benzene ring is C6H4 (since it's di-substituted, it's C6H4). So substituents contribute 11-6=5 C and 12-4=8 H.

Substituents add 5 C and 8 H.

Each substituent is probably an ester group.

An ester group is RCOOR', which has (R contributes m C and n H, R' contributes p C and q H).

Wait, but perhaps each substituent is a methyl ester, OCOOCH3, which is 3 C (COOCH3), 3 H (from CH3), and 2 O.

But if we have two substituents, each would be OCOOCH3. So substituents would contribute 3*2=6 C, but the formula requires 5 C from substituents. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, one substituent is a methyl ester (OCOOCH3) and the other is a vinyl group. But the vinyl group is CH2=CH–, which has 3 C (if attached as CH2=CH–X), but that complicates the H count.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester. Let's say substituent is OCOCH2CH2–, but that includes –CH2, which isn't present in the NMR.

Alternatively, substituent is OCOCH2CH=CH2. But that brings –CH2 again.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Another angle: the 1H NMR shows two –CH3 groups. So, the compound has two different –CH3 groups. If each substituent is an ester with a –CH3 group, but in different environments, their –CH3 would be different. But if both substituents are same, the –CH3 would be same, giving a single peak. So in the NMR, two –CH3 signals suggest two different –CH3 groups, perhaps from two different substituents.

So, substituent 1: OCOOR1, substituent 2: OCOOR2, where R1 and R2 are different and each has a –CH3.

But that would require each R to have a –CH3. For example, R1 is CH2CH3 (ethyl) and R2 is CH3 (methyl). But then the substituents would contribute –CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR.

Alternatively, R1 and R2 are both methyl groups but attached in different positions, but that would make their –CH3 equivalent, giving a single peak, which doesn't match the NMR.

Hmm. Maybe the substituents are not esters but something else. Wait, but the IR says ester group. So, at least one substituent is an ester.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a vinyl ester and the other is a methyl group. Let's model that.

Substituent 1: OCOOCH3 (methyl ester)
Substituent 2: CH2=CH– (vinyl group)

So, the substituents would contribute:

Substituent 1: OCOOCH3 → adds 3 C, 3 H, 2 O.
Substituent 2: CH2=CH– → adds 2 C, 4 H (assuming it's CH2=CH–, but attached to the ring, it would have 2 H on the CH2 and 2 H on the CH, but wait, it's attached as a substituent, so perhaps as CH2=CH–Ar. Then, the substituent is CH2=CH–, which has 4 H (CH2 and CH each have 2 H, but in a vinyl group, each CH has 1 H because of the double bond.

Wait, no. Vinyl group is CH2=CH–. When attached to the ring, the structure is Ar-CH2-CH2–, but that's not correct because that's a single bond. Wait, no, the substituent would be CH2=CH– attached to the ring via the CH2 or the CH. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group connected as CH2=CH–O–CO–O–R, but that's getting too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a vinyl group attached as CH2=CH–Ar, which would have H's on the CH2 and CH. But the NMR doesn't show –CH2 groups, so this can't be.

Wait, maybe substituent 2 is a substituent where the vinyl group is directly attached to the ring without any CH2. Like, substituent is a benzyl group with a vinyl. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 2 is a methyl group (CH3), which would give a –CH3 group. Then substituent 1 is a vinyl ester, which would have a –CH3 group. Let's model that.

Substituent 1: OCOOCH2CH2CH3 → ethyl ester, but that has –CH2 groups, which the NMR doesn't show.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let's try to think about the molecular formula.

Option B is C12H14O2.

The benzene ring is C6H4. Substituents contribute 12-6=6 C and 14-4=10 H.

Each substituent is an ester group, so each contributes (COOR), which has (1 C from COO and R's C). So if both substituents are methyl esters (COOCH3), each substituent contributes 2 C (COO and CH3). Two substituents would contribute 4 C. 6 C needed, so the substituents must have 6 C in total. Wait, that doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a methyl ester (COOCH3 → 2 C) and the other is a larger substituent. So substituent 2 contributes 4 C. For example, substituent 2 could be COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester, which has 3 C: COO contributes 2, CH2CH3 contributes 2? Wait, no: COOCH2CH3 is (COO) + (CH2CH3) → 2 +2 =4 C. So substituent 2 is COOCH2CH3.

So substituents 1 and 2: COOCH3 (2 C) and COOCH2CH3 (3 C) → total substituent C =5, but we need 6. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a larger group, like COOCH(CH3)2 (isopropyl ester), which contributes 4 C (COO + isopropyl: 2 +2=4). So substituent 1: COOCH3 (2 C), substituent 2: COOCH(CH3)2 (4 C). Total substituent C: 6. That fits.

The H's:

Substituent 1: COOCH3 contributes 3 H (from CH3).
Substituent 2: COOCH(CH3)2 contributes 6 H (CH(CH3)2 has 2 H on the CH and 6 H on the two CH3 groups).
Total substituent H: 3 +6=9 H.

Ring's H:4.

Total H: 4 +9=13. But option B has H14. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, substituent 2 could be another methyl ester, but that would give both substituents as COOCH3. Then substituent C would be 2*2=4 C, which is less than 6 C needed.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a propyl ester, like COOCH2CH2CH3. Which is 3 C (COO) plus 3 C (CH2CH2CH3) → 5 C. So substituents: 2 +5=7 C. But we need 6 C.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should consider the molecular formula and the substituent H count.

Given that the NMR doesn't show any –CH2 groups, the substituents can't have any. So perhaps the substituents are both methyl esters, but that would give only two –CH3 groups, which matches the NMR. But the O count would be 4, which doesn't match the formula's O2.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not esters. But the IR says ester group is present, so that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an aromatic ester, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a phenyl ester, which would add more rings but not necessarily change the O count. But this is getting too vague.

Another approach: the number of protons in the NMR.

The NMR shows six signals. So:

Aromatic H: 2 signals → perhaps 2+2=4 H.
Vinyl H: 2 signals → perhaps 1+1=2 H.
–CH3: 2 signals → perhaps 3+3=6 H.
Total H: 4 +2 +6=12.

But the molecular formula must have this number of H's.

Looking at the options:

Option D: C11H12O2 → H=12. So that fits.
Option B: C12H14O2 → H=14. Doesn't fit.

So option D has H12, which matches the NMR total H. So the correct formula is D.

But let's cross-check. If the structure is a benzene ring (C6H4) with two substituents:

Each substituent would contribute some H's.

Suppose substituent 1 is a methyl ester (OCOOCH3): 3 H from –CH3.

Substituent 2 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH–), but that brings –CH2, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, substituent 2 is a methylene group (–CH2–), but that's a single bond, which isn't a vinyl.

Wait, perhaps substituent 2 is a –CH3 group. So substituent 1 is OCOOCH3, substituent 2 is CH3.

Then, substituent 1 contributes 3 H (CH3), substituent 2 contributes 3 H (CH3). So total substituent H:6.

Ring's H:4.

Total H: 4+6=10. But the formula D has H12. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: substituent 1 is OCOOCH3 (3 H) and substituent 2 is a vinyl group with two H's (each H in a doublet, as per NMR). So substituent 2 contributes 2 H.

But that would give substituent H:3+2=5. Plus ring's 4 → 9 H. Doesn't match.

Hmm, this is confusing.

But earlier, when considering the NMR's H count, option D's H12 matched the sum. So perhaps that makes D the correct answer.

So, the correct formula is D) C11H12O2.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with an ester group, as indicated by the FTIR spectrum. The 1H NMR spectrum provides the following information:

1. **Aromatic protons**: Two signals indicate that the aromatic ring has two distinct sets of protons, likely due to the di-substitution pattern (e.g., meta or ortho substitution).
2. **Vinyl protons**: Two signals, one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets, suggest the presence of a vinyl group with two distinct proton environments.
3. **Methyl protons**: Two signals correspond to two distinct –CH3 groups, likely from two different substituents.

The absence of –CH2 signals in the NMR spectrum implies that the substituents do not contain –CH2 groups. The molecular formula must account for the degrees of unsaturation, which are calculated as follows:

- The aromatic ring contributes 4 degrees of unsaturation.
- Each ester group contributes 1 additional degree of unsaturation due to the carbonyl group.

Thus, the compound has a total of 6 degrees of unsaturation. Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (C11H14O2)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 5, which is inconsistent with the required 6.
- **Option B (C12H14O2)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6, consistent with the required 6, but the molecular formula does not match the NMR data (H = 14, while the NMR suggests H = 12).
- **Option C (C12H12O2)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 7, which is inconsistent with the required 6.
- **Option D (C11H12O2)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 6, consistent with the required 6, and the molecular formula matches the NMR data (H = 12).

The structure is likely a benzene ring with two substituents: one methyl ester (OCOOCH3) and one vinyl group. The methyl ester accounts for the two –CH3 signals in the NMR, while the vinyl group accounts for the two vinyl proton signals. The aromatic protons are split into two signals due to the di-substitution pattern.

Thus, the correct molecular formula is **C11H12O2**.
