Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem involves two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, all in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different values for v_rel and E.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just use classical mechanics because those speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, I'll need to use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

First, let's tackle the relative speed part. I think the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is different from the classical addition. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)), right? So, wait, each astronaut is moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but using the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, wait, no. Because if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds from the perspective of one of them. So, let me think. One is moving at 0.6c, and the other at 0.5c. So, from the perspective of the first astronaut (the one moving at 0.6c), what's the speed of the second astronaut?

So, using the velocity addition formula, u' is the velocity of the second astronaut (0.5c) as observed from the first astronaut's frame. So the formula would be (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)), where u is 0.5c and v is -0.6c? Wait, no, because the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c relative to the stationary frame (like the earth), so the second is at 0.5c in the same direction. So, from the first astronaut's frame, the second is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) relative, but that's using Galilean addition, which is wrong at high speeds.

So, the correct formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/(c²)), where u' is the velocity of the second astronaut in the stationary frame (0.5c), and v is the velocity of the first astronaut relative to the stationary frame (0.6c). Wait, no, wait. Maybe I should set it up differently. Let me correct that.

The formula for relative velocity when moving from frame S to frame S' which is moving at velocity v. So, if in S, object A is moving at u, and object B is moving at v, then from A's perspective, what's the speed of B?

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. The correct formula for the relative speed u' when you have two objects moving at u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, so if object B is moving at speed v as observed from the stationary frame, and object A is moving at speed u as observed from the stationary frame, then the speed of B relative to A would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait, no: because if the stationary frame says object A is moving at u (say, 0.6c), and object B is moving at v (say, 0.5c), then from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Since both are moving in the same direction, B is moving slower than A. So, the relative speed should be v - u, but divided by 1 - (uv)/c².

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for the relative velocity when adding two velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (uv)/(c²)). But wait, that's the case when you're adding velocities in the same direction. But in this case, from the perspective of A, what is B's velocity?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think using the Lorentz transformation. The velocity u' (of object B as seen from A's frame) is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of B in the stationary frame and v is the velocity of A in the stationary frame.

Wait, but let me check: if the stationary frame is S, then A is moving at velocity v = 0.6c. B is moving at u = 0.5c. So, from A's frame (S'), the velocity of B would be u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no: because when you switch frames, the velocity u' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So, substituting u=0.5c and v=0.6c, that would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Calculating numerator: 0.5 -0.6 = -0.1c → -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (-0.1c) / 0.7 → approximately -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction to A's motion. Wait, but both are moving in the positive x-direction in the stationary frame. So from A's perspective, B is moving backward? That can't be right because A is moving faster than B. Oh, wait: if B is moving at 0.5c and A at 0.6c, then from A's frame, B would be moving backward, i.e., in the negative direction because A is moving faster than B.

But wait, the problem is asking for the relative speed, which is a magnitude, so we can take the absolute value. So, 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

So that's the relative speed. Now, moving on to the total energy of the system.

The total energy of each astronaut is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². Each astronaut's mass is given, so we have to calculate each one's energy and add them.

Wait, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. So, the energies would be:

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So v = 0.6c, v²/c² = 0.36.

So sqrt(1−0.36) = sqrt(0.64) = 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma * (2m) c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

v=0.5c → v²/c²=0.25.

sqrt(1-0.25) = sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660.

Gamma = 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

Energy E2 = gamma * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈3.464 m c².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² +3.464 m c² ≈5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option B says 4.96, which is lower. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back, the relative speed was about 0.14c, and the energy is 5.96 mc², which matches option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me double-check the relative speed calculation again because I might have made a mistake.

So, from A's frame (moving at 0.6c), what is the velocity of B (moving at 0.5c in the stationary frame)?

Using the formula u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

u=0.5c, v=0.6c.

So numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.5c *0.6c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1-0.3=0.7.

So u' = (-0.1 c)/0.7 = - (1/7) c ≈-0.1428c.

The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction (since A is moving at 0.6c, B is moving slower, so from A's perspective, B is moving backward). The magnitude is approximately 0.1428c, which rounds to 0.14c.

So the relative speed is 0.14c and the total energy is about 5.96 mc², which is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(u = 0.5c\) (velocity of the second astronaut in the stationary frame) and \(v = 0.6c\) (velocity of the first astronaut in the stationary frame). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.5c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates that the second astronaut appears to move backward relative to the first astronaut. Taking the magnitude, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
