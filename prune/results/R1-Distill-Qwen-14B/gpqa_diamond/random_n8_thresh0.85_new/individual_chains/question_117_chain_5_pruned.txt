Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons bonded to four different groups. So, I need to look for compounds in the given options that have such centers.

Let me go through each of the four moieties given.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the rings rotating or not. Wait, biphenyls with substituents can have different arrangements. But optical isomerism is about chirality. So, if the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it can have stereoisomers. Let me think: dimethyl esters at 2 and 2' positions and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Since the substituents are on opposite ends, perhaps the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the groups on each ring are symmetric across the central bond, maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents cause the two rings to be mirror images without an internal plane, then it could be chiral. I'm a bit unsure here. Biphenyls can have E and Z configurations, but that's more about the substituents' positions relative to each other. Wait, but for optical isomerism, the molecule must lack a plane of symmetry. So if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, it will show optical isomerism. I think in this case, the substituents are in the 2 and 2' positions, and the nitro groups are in 6,6'. The structure might be such that there's no internal plane of symmetry, making it a candidate for optical isomerism. But I'm not entirely sure.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no: wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me think. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, wait, no: propionic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the propanoate ester would be CH3CH2COO-OCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propionic acid. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. So when it's the methyl ester, it becomes HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Now, look for chiral centers. The second carbon (HOCH2-) is attached to what? Let's see: the central carbon is CH2. Wait, no: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no, because propanoate is three carbons. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

- The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So looking at the carbons: the
