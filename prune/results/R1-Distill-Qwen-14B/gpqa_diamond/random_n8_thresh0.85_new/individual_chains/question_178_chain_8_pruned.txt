Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian in a physics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum field theory, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. So the interaction term here involves a fermion field ψ, and the field strength tensor F from some gauge field, probably electromagnetism or something similar.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Okay, mass dimension is about the units when you consider natural units where ℏ = c = 1. The mass dimension of an operator is determined by the requirement that the action is dimensionless (since in quantum mechanics, the exponent in the path integral must be dimensionless).

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action ∫d^4x L must be dimensionless, and [d^4x] = [mass]^−4. So each term in L must have [mass]^4.

So, let's analyze the dimensions of each part of the term. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, the fields: ψ is a Dirac spinor. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor (like in the Dirac Lagrangian) is 3/2. Because in the Dirac term, L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each ψ has dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ has the same, and the derivative has dimension 1. Then the term must have dimension 4: [ψ̄][ψ] = (3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4, and [∂_μ] is 1, so total is 13/4? Wait, no wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the entire term i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ has dimension (3/2 + 3/2 + 1) = 5? That can’t be. Oh wait, no, the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term must be dimension 4.

Wait, let's think again. The derivative ∂_μ has mass dimension 1 (since [∂_μ] = [mass]^1). The fields ψ have dimension 3/2 each because L must be dimension 4. So for the term i ψ̄ γ μ ∂_μ ψ: [ψ̄] is 3/2, [γ_mu is dimensionless, [∂_mu] is 1, [ψ] is 3/2. So overall, 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 5? But wait, that's 5, but the Lagrangian must be dimension 4. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, no—Wait, no, no, the term is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. So the term as a whole must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

Wait, so let's compute the dimension of ψ. Let me think about the Dirac Lagrangian: L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. So the term i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ must have dimension 4. So [ψ̄][γ][∂][ψ] = [ψ]^2 [∂] since ψ̄ and ψ have the same dimension. So [ψ]^2 [∂] = 4. [∂] is [mass]^1, so [ψ]^2 = 3 → [ψ] = 3/2. Yes, that makes sense.

So ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ also has dimension 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. Since gamma matrices are dimensionless, σ_mu_nu must be dimensionless as well. So when we multiply ψ̄ and σ_mu_nu, that's (3/2) * (something). But let's think about the term ψ̄ σ_mu_nu ψ. The tensor σ has dimension 0, since it's made of gammas and commutators. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension (3/2 + 3/2) = 3.

Now, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{mu nu} is defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each A is a vector potential, which has dimension 1. Because the field strength F has dimension 2. Wait, because [∂] is 1, and A has dimension 1. So F is ∂A → [F] = [∂][A] = 2.

So now, the term in the Lagrangian is κ * ψ̄ σ F. Let's compute the dimensions:

κ [ψ̄] [σ] [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + (3 + 2) = [κ] +5.

But since each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, is the theory renormalizable? Well, the renormaliz
