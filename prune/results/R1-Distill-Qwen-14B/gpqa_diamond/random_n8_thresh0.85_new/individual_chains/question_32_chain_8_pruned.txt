Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, so Li is lithium. I remember that lithium has an atomic number of 3. But wait, Li with 3 neutrons would mean the isotope Li-6, right? Because Li typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 6 (3+3). So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

I need to find the total energy of the nucleus, which I think is the relativistic energy since it's moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light (0.96c). So relativistic effects are definitely in play here.

The options are all in GeV, which is a unit of energy, so I'm on the right track.

So, the steps I need to take probably involve:

1. Find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Use the relativistic energy formula to calculate the total energy when the speed is 0.96c.

Let me break it down. First, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. I'll need to calculate that.

The rest mass of a nucleus is the sum of the rest masses of its protons and neutrons minus any binding energy, but wait, for approximate calculations, we might just take the sum of the individual nucleons because binding energy is usually much smaller, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can look up the mass of Li-6.

Wait, but since this is a problem for a test, perhaps the exact mass isn't given. Maybe I should compute it based on the known masses of protons and neutrons.

Wait, I think I can proceed with that approach. Let me recall the approximate rest masses:

- Proton: about 938.272 MeV/c²
- Neutron: about 939.565 MeV/c²
- Electron: 0.511 MeV/c², but since we're dealing with a nucleus, not considering electrons here.

So, the Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass m is:

m = 3*(mass of proton) + 3*(mass of neutron)

Let me compute that numerically. Let's convert everything to GeV for consistency with the options.

Wait, 1 GeV = 10^3 MeV. So 938.272 MeV is 0.938272 GeV.

So:

Proton: 0.938272 GeV/c²
Neutron: 0.939565 GeV/c²

So three protons: 3 * 0.938272 = 2.814816 GeV/c²
Three neutrons: 3 * 0.939565 = 2.818695 GeV/c²
Total rest mass m = 2.814816 + 2.818695 = 5.633511 GeV/c²

Wait, but wait, that might not be entirely accurate because the mass might be slightly less due to the binding energy. But in problems like this, I think using the sum of the individual nucleon masses is acceptable unless stated otherwise. Alternatively, if the exact mass is given, perhaps it's better to use that. But since I don't have the exact mass of Li-6, I'll proceed with this calculation.

Alternatively, I can look up the exact mass of Li-6. Let me see, I think the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus (which is a beryllium isotope? No, wait, Li is lithium. Li-6 is Carbon? No, no, Li has atomic number 3. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so mass number 6.

Wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u, where u is the atomic mass unit. Oh wait, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So perhaps I should calculate using the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, but I'm not sure of the exact value. Let me think: the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units. So converting that to GeV/c².

So 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.013 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, 0.013 *931.5= about 12.1
