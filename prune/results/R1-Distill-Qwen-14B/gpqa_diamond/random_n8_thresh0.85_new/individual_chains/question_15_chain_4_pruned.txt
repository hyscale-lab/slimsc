Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm. Right, the transit method depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on.

Wait, the probability formula for a planet to transit is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but I think it's actually (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by some factor. Oh right, I remember the approximate formula is (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - eÂ²))) ), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term (e) is zero, so it simplifies. So the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The probability is roughly (R_star / a_planet) * ( (1 + R_planet / R_star) ), but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the R_planet term is negligible. So it's approximately (R_star / a_planet).

Wait, no, wait. I think the actual formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a / (sqrt(1 - (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a^2))), but that's when considering the planet's size. Alternatively, maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by a factor that depends on the orbital inclination. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I've read somewhere that the probability of a planet transiting is roughly (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sqrt(1 - (R_star / a_planet)^2))) ). Hmm, but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) divided by the distance from which you're observing, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet * (1 / sqrt(1 - (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a_planet^2 )) ), but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else.

Wait, wait. I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (sqrt(1 -
