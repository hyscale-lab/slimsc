Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and take notes.

The question says: Compound X has certain IR and NMR data. It reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I have to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D. Each is a different organic compound.

First, I should analyze the spectroscopic data to figure out what Compound X is. Then, I'll think about what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI—oh, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction, I think. Or maybe it's a different reaction. I remember that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to break the double bond and form diiodides. Alternatively, when you have an alkyne, treating with HX (like HI) might add across the triple bond.

Wait, no, the Hunsdiecker reaction usually involves the bromide or iodide of an alkene. Another option is that red phosphorus is used to generate HX (like HI) from something. Oh wait, maybe it's the hydrohalogenation? Or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when an alkyne is treated with HI, it can add to the triple bond. For example, a terminal alkyne adding HI would form a vicinal dihalide. But wait, I'm not sure if red phosphorus is involved here. Oh wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI is a reagent for the hydrolysis of nitriles? No, that's when using H2O. Alternatively, maybe the compound has a carbonyl group, and HI is acting as a nucleophile?

Wait, I think I might be getting confused. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong absorption between 3400–2500 cm^-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, some are acids (options A and C), which have carboxylic acid groups (O-H). The other options are aromatic compounds without O-H, so maybe the IR suggests a carbonyl group as well.

Looking at the IR peaks: 1720 cm^-1 is a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O), like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm^-1 regions might be from aromatic C=C stretching. Also, the broad peak in the 3400–2500 region is likely an O-H stretch from a carboxylic acid, maybe.

Now, the NMR data. Let's go through each peak.

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet, probably an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, maybe para-substituted. Let's think about coupling. If it's a doublet integrating for 2H, it could be two protons adjacent to substituents on a benzene ring. Perhaps a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, each with two adjacent protons.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. If the ring is para-substituted with two groups, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an alkyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a substituent that causes the protons to split into two doublets. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions—like a carbonyl group and an alkyl group.
Wait, but the integration is 2H each. So if the ring has two substituents in para, then the protons would be in a para positions, leading to each set being a doublet. Because each H is next to two substituents? Or maybe each substituent is causing the splitting. Hmm, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene where each substituent is connected to two H's. For example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a benzene ring with a COOH group) and the other is a substituent with two Hs, but that might complicate it.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group (like a COOH) at position 1 and another group at position 4, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and similarly for 3 and 5. So each of these would couple with their adjacent H's.

Wait, if the substituent at position 4 is a group like -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 or something, but that might not fit the NMR. Hmm.

Another part of the NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – a multiplet integrating for 1H. That suggests a CH group attached to something. Maybe a CH next to a carbonyl or an aromatic ring.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet for 2H. Could be part of a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point or a carbonyl.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet for 3H. This is likely a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. A common scenario is a methyl adjacent to a CH group, like in isopropyl groups. For example, in an isopropyl group, the CH is next to the methyl.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for 3H, which is typically a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, as in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. Let's think: the IR suggests a carboxylic acid (due to the broad O-H and the 1720 cm^-1 peak, maybe a carbonyl, but maybe an ester or ketone as well). The NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid proton.

So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Let's consider that.

Looking at the aromatic protons: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests that the aromatic ring has two substituents at the para positions, each affecting the neighboring protons. For example, a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another group that's an electron-donating group, like an alkyl chain. Wait, but COOH is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the protons and cause them to appear downfield.

Wait, in a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and an alkyl group, the protons meta to the COOH would be more deshielded. Let me think: if the substituents are in the 1 and 4 positions, then the H's in positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the substituent in position 1 (COOH), so they would be more deshielded (higher ppm), and the H's in positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to the substituent in position 4 (the alkyl group), which is an electron-donating group, so those would be less deshielded, lower ppm.

So the higher field (7.2 ppm) would be the H's adjacent to the alkyl group, and the lower field (8.0 ppm) would be adjacent to the COOH group. That fits with the NMR data.

So the structure would be something like 4-alkylbenzoic acid. Then, the substituent on the benzene is an alkyl group.

Now, the rest of the NMR data: the CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H, m), and then the CH2 groups and the methyl groups.

Looking at the substituent on the benzene, the alkyl group must have a structure that gives the NMR signals we're seeing. Let's see:

The substituent is attached to the benzene as a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't fit. Or perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but the NMR suggests perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The substituent must be a group that leads to a CH group, a CH2 group, and a methyl group.

Looking at the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): the methyl at 0.9 is a triplet, which indicates it's attached to a CH2 group that's next to another CH2. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is likely a methyl attached to a CH group. So perhaps the structure is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group? Or maybe a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think of the substituent as a sec-butyl group. Let's imagine:

The substituent is -CH2-C(CH2CH3)H- attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but maybe it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with branching. Let me think step by step.

The substituent on the benzene ring is an alkyl group. Let's say the structure is benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and an alkyl group at position 4.

The alkyl group's NMR signals are the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a CH group, then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to the benzene, and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a methyl attached to a CH. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl on a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: the substituent could be a pentyl group, but the specific structure would be necessary.

Alternatively, let's consider the substituent as a isopropyl group. But that might not account for all the signals.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Let's see:

The substituent is a butyl group, perhaps with a branch. Let me sketch this.

If the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-, no, that might not fit. Alternatively, it's a sec-butyl group. Let's think:_sec-butyl group is (CH2)2CHCH2- attached? Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. But in that case, the CH group would be at 2.9 ppm as a triplet? But in the NMR, it's a multiplet of 1H. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the substituent's structure. The substituent is connected to the benzene and then has a chain that results in those NMR signals.

The substituent's NMR:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m): likely a CH group attached to something else.

- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m): perhaps a CH2 group attached to the benzene.

- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d): methyl attached to a CH.

- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t): methyl at the end of a chain, like ethyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. Wait no, but the 0.9 is a triplet, so the CH2 would be adjacent to another CH2. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, that would have more than one CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me consider the structure:

The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that would have a branch but maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group. No, but then the NMR would show more peaks.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that doesn't fit the 0.9 triplet.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So the substituent is a 3-methylbutyl group? Let me think:

-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to benzene. Then, the NMR would have:

The CH(CH3) would be a CH with two neighboring CH2 groups. The CH2 groups would have their own signals.

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene as -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. So the structure would be benzene-(CH2)2-CH(CH3)-.

The NMR would then show:

- The CH(CH3) as a CH group. The protons on the CH would be split into a multiplet, perhaps integrating as 1H. That fits 2.9 ppm.

The CH2 groups adjacent to the benzene and the CH would each have their own signals. The CH2 next to the benzene (the first CH2 in the substituent) would be split into a triplet from the adjacent CH2 and the benzene (but the benzene is not a CH, so maybe it's a quartet? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, say, a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure of sec-butyl.

The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, that can't be right. No, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene? No, no, wait, the structure is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the substituent as -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

But that would give a CH group adjacent to two CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. Then, the CH(CH3) would be the central CH, attached to two CH2 groups.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The CH(CH3) as a triplet (if adjacent to
