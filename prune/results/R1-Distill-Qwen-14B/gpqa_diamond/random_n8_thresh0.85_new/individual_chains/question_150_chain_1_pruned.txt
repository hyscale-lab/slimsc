Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out what the final product is.

First, let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H-NMR shows:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let's think about each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes aromatic protons can be that high too, but in this case, the triplet might suggest it's next to something else, maybe a CH2 group or another proton.

The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets each integrating to 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. Since they're doublets, maybe they're adjacent to substituents on a benzene ring. Wait, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene? Because in that case, the protons would be in two sets—like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. 

Then there's the 6.27 ppm, broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH proton, but wait, usually OH protons are even broader and appear around 1-5 ppm, but sometimes they can be in aromatic regions. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some other proton environment. Hmm, not sure yet.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That seems like a CH2 group adjacent to something. Oxygen nearby? Maybe an OCH2 group or part of an aldehyde or ketone. Wait, but if it's a doublet, it's next to another set of protons. So maybe a -CH2- group attached to an oxygen.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an aromatic ring, another aromatic ring (since two different doublets for 2H each), and a side chain that includes an aldehyde and some CH2 groups.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. 

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That can be one ring (benzene) which is 4 degrees, and perhaps a double bond or another ring. Oh wait, the molecular formula could have a benzene ring (4 DOU), then another ring or a double bond and a ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is a diaryl compound with a side chain that includes a double bond and an aldehyde.

Let me think about the possible structure. The NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72 ppm, triplet), and two aromatic rings. Wait, because the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 each are 2H, that suggests two substituents on a benzene ring, perhaps in the para positions. Wait, no, if it's para, each set would be a singlet, but the splitting is a doublet. Hmm, maybe each ring is substituted in a way that the adjacent protons are split into doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzene, but that would probably show more splitting. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the ortho positions. Wait, but in that case, the coupling would be more than one neighbor. Maybe the aromatic system is a substituted benzene ring where each substituent is a group with its own protons that split the neighboring ones. Or perhaps the compound has two aromatic rings connected by a side chain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is a cinnamaldehyde derivative. Cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with a benzene ring and a propenal group. But let me see.

Looking at the peaks:

The triplet at 9.72 ppm for 1H—this is likely the aldehyde proton. The coupling (t) indicates it's next to two equivalent protons. So maybe the aldehyde is attached to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 or something else.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet (2H). So maybe it's a CH2 group attached to an oxygen
