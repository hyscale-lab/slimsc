Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. The parallax (usually denoted as 'plx') is inversely proportional to distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away. Wait, right, the formula is distance = 1 / parallax (in parsecs, I think). So if plx increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—I guess that means the same number per unit volume in space? Because uniform distribution would imply that the density is constant. So the number density of stars is uniform.

So, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, I need to find how many stars are in that range. But how does this translate into the number of stars per unit parallax?

Let me think about the volume of space corresponding to a given parallax range. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, higher parallax means closer stars. So if I have a small change in parallax, how does that relate to the volume?

Wait, I think the number of stars in a given volume depends on how much volume there is. If the density is uniform, then the number of stars is proportional to the volume. So if I can find the volume between parallax plx and plx + dplx, that would help.

Parallax plx is related to distance d as d = 1/plx. So when plx increases by a small amount, the corresponding distance changes. But wait, actually, when plx increases, the distance decreases because d = 1/plx. Hmm, so a small increase in plx corresponds to a decrease in distance.

To find the volume between two distances, I think I should calculate the difference in the volumes of spheres at those distances. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the volume between d and d + dd would be approximately (4/3)π(d + dd)^3 - (4/3)πd^3.

But wait, since dd is small compared to d, maybe I can approximate this. Using a Taylor expansion: (d + dd)^3 ≈ d³ + 3d² dd. So the volume difference is (4/3)π [d³ + 3d² dd - d³] = (4/3)π * 3d² dd = 4π d² dd.

So the volume element (the change in volume) is 4π d² dd. Since each star at distance d occupies a small volume around it, the number of stars in that volume element would be the volume times the number density (which is uniform).

Let me denote the number density as n (stars per unit volume). So the number of stars between distance d and d + dd is n * 4π d² dd. But wait, the question is about parallax, so I need to express this in terms of plx.

Since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in. So d = 1/plx, so dd (change in d) would be the derivative of d with respect to plx, multiplied by dplx. Let's compute that.

d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, which makes sense. But we're considering a small range in plx, so the absolute value of dd would be (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (1/plx²) dplx. So the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx) ?

Wait, let me clarify. The volume element in terms of d is 4π d² dd. But dd is ( -1/plx² ) dplx. So substituting, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -1/plx² dplx ). But since we're considering the absolute value, we can drop the negative sign.

So volume element = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx) ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, no, let me do that substitution correctly. Because d = 1/plx, so d² = (1/plx)^2. And dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So when you substitute, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx. But since the integral is from a lower plx to higher plx, the negative sign would reverse the limits, so the actual volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the substitution. Let's try a different approach. Let's express the volume in terms of plx.

So, the volume element in terms of d is 4π d² dd. To express this in terms of plx, we can find the relation between dd and dplx.

From d = 1/plx, taking derivative with respect to plx:

dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, rearranged, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx → dplx = - plx² dd.

But the volume element is 4π d² dd. Let's express everything in terms of plx.

d = 1/plx → d² = 1/plx².

dd = - (1/plx²) dplx → So, we can write dd = (-1/plx²) dplx.

So, substituting into the volume element: 4π * (1/plx²) * ( -1/plx² dplx )

Wait, that would be 4π * (1/plx² ) * ( -1/plx² dplx )

Which is 4π ( -1 / plx^4 ) dplx.

But since d is a positive quantity, and we're integrating over a positive range, perhaps we should take absolute values. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx^4 ) dplx.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the substitution. Let's see:

The volume element in terms of d is 4π d² dd. But since dd is negative when plx increases, perhaps we should express it as:

dV = 4π d² |dd|.

But since d = 1/plx, |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx ) = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Hence, the volume element in terms of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx.

So the number of stars in that volume element is number density n multiplied by dV. So number of stars per unit plx range is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the question is asking for the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So it's the number of stars in a range dplx, which is (n * 4π) (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx is (n * 4π) * (1/plx^4 )

But wait, the number per unit range would be the number per (dplx). So the number density in plx space is (n * 4π) * (1/plx^4 )

So the number of stars per unit plx (per dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not missing any factors. Because sometimes when dealing with transformations, there are factors of 2 or other constants, but in this case, since we're looking for a scaling relation, the exact coefficient isn't important—just the dependence on plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (per dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4), so the correct answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars is constant, and the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

The volume element between distances \( d \) and \( d + dd \) is approximately \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The volume element in terms of plx becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume element is proportional to the number density \( n \) of stars multiplied by \( dV \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of plx is:

\[
\text{Number per unit plx range} \propto n \cdot 4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Among the given options, this matches option A.
