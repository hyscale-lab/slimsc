Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researcher is having trouble overexpressing the protein, so they're looking into why that's happening.

So the setup is that they genetically engineered a plasmid to overexpress GADD45G with an added hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The question provides a DNA sequence of the plus strand of their construct. I need to look for potential issues in this sequence that would prevent proper expression.

The options given are A to D. Let's go through each possibility.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. The tag is at the N-terminus, so a mutation there might affect the tag's recognition but not necessarily prevent the protein from being expressed. Unless the mutation is in a critical region for the function, it might just make the tag ineffective, but the protein should still be produced. So perhaps this isn't the main issue here.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would mean there's a premature stop codon. Ribosomes translate mRNA from the start codon (AUG) until they hit a stop codon (like UAA, UAG, UGA). So if the DNA construct has a stop codon introduced early, the mRNA might have a premature stop, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all. But looking at the sequence, let's check for stop codons. Let me think: the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon (AUG in mRNA). Then the next codons are TAC (TYR), CCA (Pro), etc. I should look for any of the stop codon triplets in the DNA, but since it's the coding (sense) strand, the mRNA would have the complementary bases. 

Wait, the DNA is the plus strand, so the mRNA is the same as the DNA, except T becomes U. So looking for in-frame UAA, UAG, or UGA in the mRNA. Let me scan through the sequence. Let's see:

Looking for the codons:

For example, after the start ATG (position 1-3), next codons are TAC (positions 4-6: TAC -> TYR), then CC ACG... Wait, perhaps I can look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA, because in the mRNA, these would correspond to UAA, UAG, UGA.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for any TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let's go through it:

- The sequence starts with ATG, so the first codon is AUG (start).
- Let's look for TAG (which is a stop in DNA as well because DNA is read in triplets, but wait, in the DNA, the coding strand is the same as mRNA except T instead of U. So, the mRNA would have UAG as a stop if the DNA has TAG.

Wait, but the DNA is the coding (sense) strand, so when transcribed into mRNA, the sequence is the same except Tâ†’U. So any TGA in the DNA would become UGA in mRNA, which is a stop.

Let me scan the sequence:

Looking for the triplet TAG, TAA, or TGA in the DNA.

Looking from the beginning:

After the start codon, the next triplets are TAC (positions 4-6), then CCA (7-9), then CGA (10-12), etc. 

Wait, looking through the sequence, I see a stretch: ...TGAACG... which is positions 20-22: TGA. So DNA has TGA, which in mRNA is UGA, which is a stop codon. Oh! That's a problem.

So the DNA has a TGA codon, which is a stop in mRNA. Let me check the exact position. The DNA sequence is:

... TGAACG ...

So the triplet would be TGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would have UGA, causing the ribosome to stop there. That would truncate the protein early, so no full-length protein is made. That would explain why the researcher couldn't overexpress the protein.

So that's option B: the ribosome terminated early because of a premature stop codon.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The entire sequence starts with ATG and ends with TGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. But wait, the end of the sequence is ...CTGAGTGA3'. So the last part is CTG AGT GA. So the last triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the gene's coding sequence ends with TGA, which in the mRNA is UGA.

So the gene has a stop codon at the end, which is correct. But wait, the construct is for overexpression. So the stop codon is correctly placed? Or is it placed too soon? Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is that in the construct, there's a premature stop codon before the end.

Wait, looking again. The sequence provided ends with TGA at the very end. So that's the proper stop. But earlier in the sequence, perhaps there's another TGA. Oh, I found one earlier: positions 20-22 are TGA. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the sequence in triplets.

But given the length, maybe I should look for any in-frame TGA or other stop codons.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence has an in-frame stop codon, causing the gene to be truncated.

Wait, looking at the sequence again. Let me check for any TGA or TAG or TAA.

Looking at the sequence, I spot another occurrence: 

Looking around the middle of the sequence, I think I see TGA again. Let me see:

Looking at this part: ...GTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACG...

So positions around there: GTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACG.

Breaking it into triplets:

GTC TAC GAG TCA GCC AAA GTC TTA GAA CG...

Wait, TTA is a codon for Phe in DNA (but in mRNA, it's UUA which is Leu). Wait, no, looking for TGA or similar.

Wait, the part after GTC TAC GAG TCA GCC AAA GTC TTA is GAA CGA ... I'm getting a bit lost. Alternatively, perhaps I should
