Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I know that the spin-up and spin-down states are orthonormal, right? So, their inner product is zero and each has norm 1.

The task is to calculate two things: first, the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and second, find the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise.

Wait, wait. So, the operator matrix is zero on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere? Wait, no, the way the question is phrased, Aij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So, the matrix is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-½ particles, so two eigenstates. Therefore, the operator matrix would look like this:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   0  ]

Hmm. That's interesting. So, the operator is an off-diagonal matrix. Let's think about what that operator represents. Oh, wait, the Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix A is similar but scaled by ħ/2. So perhaps this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so that would fit.

Wait, but the operator whose matrix is A_ij is given. So, since the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], then the operator A would be (ħ/2) * X. Because when i≠j, A_ij is ħ/2. So I think that's the case.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of X, right? Because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates, only the eigenvalues. Since X has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the operator A would have eigenvalues (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but wait. No, no. Wait, the eigenstates of X are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the |+x> and |-x> states, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So, our state |alpha> is in the |up> and |down> basis. To find the probabilities of measuring it in the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, I can think about the operator A. Since it's proportional to X, its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and the probabilities are given by the square of the amplitudes when |alpha> is expressed in that basis.

But first, perhaps I should normalize the state |alpha> to get the actual state. Because the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that expression, I need to find the normalization factor.

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the norm squared. The norm is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

The coefficient for |up> is (1 + i). Its magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For |down>, the coefficient is (2 - i). Its magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 =5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the actual state is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7
