Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Let me think about what I know.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, the gamma matrices are involved here. 

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. From what I recall, in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). 

So each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension [L] = 4. Let me break down the components of L_int.

ψ is a Dirac spinor, so its mass dimension is 3/2. That's because the Dirac equation is (∫ / ∂ - m)ψ = 0, and [m] is 1, so [ψ̄ ψ] must be 4 - [mψ] which would be 4-4=0? Wait, no. Let me think again. The term ψ̄ ψ has mass dimension 3 because the action is ∫ (ψ̄ ψ) d^4x, so the integrand must have dimension 4. Wait, no, the Lagrangian has dimension 4, and the integral is over 4 dimensions, so each term must have dimension 4.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me remember the dimensions.

In natural units, each field has a certain mass dimension. For scalar fields, φ has [φ] = 1. For Dirac spinors, ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. The field strength tensor F_{μν} for electromagnetism has dimension 2 because F is made from ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and A has dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

So, looking at L_int, let's compute the dimensions. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's compute each part:

- ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, same as ψ. So ψ̄ ψ would have dimension 3, since 3/2 + 3/2 =3.

Wait, but σ_{μν} is a product of two γ matrices, which are dimensionless, right? Because γ matrices are just matrices, not operators with derivatives. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is (3/2 + 3/2) =3.

Then, F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together: ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} is 3 + 2 =5.

So the term κ times that must have dimension 4 because the Lagrangian is dimension 4. So [κ] *5 =4 → [κ]=4/5? That can't be right because the options don't have 4/5. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I've messed up the calculation. Let's do it step by step.

Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So L_int = κ (ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ) F^{μν}.

Each field's dimension:

ψ has dimension 3/2. ψ̄ is same, so 3/2.

σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γμ, γν], which is a product of two γ matrices. Since γ matrices are dimensionless, σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) + 0 =3.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. For electromagnetism, A has dimension 1. F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative is dimension 1, and each A is 1. So F has dimension 2.

So the whole term is (3) * (2) =5. But L must have dimension 4. So κ must have [κ] = (4) -5 = -1. Because [κ] * (5) =4 → [κ] =4/5? Wait, no. Wait, the entire product is κ multiplied by (something of dimension5), which is part of the Lagrangian (dimension4). So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1. Yes, that makes sense.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. So the first part of the question is answered, [κ]_M = -1.

Now, the second part: Is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. Remember that a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the rule is that the coupling constants must have [g] ≥ 0. Because renormalizable interactions are those where the coupling has positive or zero dimension. If the coupling has negative dimension, the interaction is nonrenormalizable, which implies that the theory is effective and must be cut off at some scale.

So [κ] is -1. Negative. So the coupling constant has negative mass dimension. That implies that this term is nonrenormalizable. Wait, but wait. Wait, I think the rule is that the coupling must have a non-negative dimension for the interaction to be renormalizable. Because when you consider the
