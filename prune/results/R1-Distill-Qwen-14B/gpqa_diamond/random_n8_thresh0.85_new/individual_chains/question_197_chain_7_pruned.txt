Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me think through this step by step. The question is about identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let's break down the given data. The problem provides IR and 1H NMR spectra for compound X. I remember that IR can tell me about functional groups, and NMR gives information about the structure, like the number and type of protons.

Looking at the IR data: strong absorption between 3400-2500 cm-1. That's a broad range, but I recall that O-H stretches are usually in that region. Specifically, if it's a broad peak, it might be an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1720 cm-1 and 1610 cm-1 also stand out. 1720 is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be from an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid. But wait, if there's a broad peak around 3000, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because their O-H is broad. Alternatively, if it were an ester, the O-H might not be there unless it's a free acid.

The 1610 cm-1 peak is in the range of aromatic C=C stretches. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring. The 1450 cm-1 peak might be from C-O or C-C stretching, but I'm not too sure on that.

Now the NMR data: looking at the 1H NMR, the signals are as follows.

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm suggests an -OH proton, probably from a carboxylic acid. If it were an ester, the proton would be around 4-5 ppm, but an acidic proton like that would be more downfield. So, that supports the idea of a carboxylic acid group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents. Each is a doublet, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) for the two protons indicates they're next to an electron-withdrawing group. The 7.2 ppm is upfield, so maybe they are adjacent to something else. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent are usually downfield-shifted. So, if the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, the adjacent protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. So, in this case, the 8.0 ppm is probably the protons next to the substituent, and the 7.2 ppm are the other two ortho protons? Wait, no, for a para-substituted benzene, each substituent has two adjacent protons (ortho) and two opposite (para). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of substituents. Let's say the substituent is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 have protons that are next to it (ortho), and positions 3 and 5 are meta. But in para substitution, only two substituents? Or wait, the molecule might have two substituents. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets each integrating to 2H. Probably, it's a di-substituted benzene in the para positions. So the substituent is at positions 1 and 3? No, wait, if the substituent is at positions 1 and 4, wait, that would be para, but that's just single substituent. Hmm, maybe the benzene has two substituents, each in the para positions relative to each other. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent in the para position, but then the NMR would show two protons as a doublet each, but perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent at position 4, and another at position 1, but that would make it di-substituted at the para position. Or maybe it's a substituent that's a substituent group itself, such as a carbonyl group.

Wait, looking at the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl. So, maybe the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But the 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid because that's a very downfield shift. So perhaps the benzene ring has a substituent which is a carboxylic acid group.

Putting this
