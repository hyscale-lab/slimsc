Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read through the question again carefully.

So, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm^-1, but more importantly, they have an O-C-O stretch around 1200-1300 cm^-1. So, the presence of an ester functional group is confirmed.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let me break that down. Each signal corresponds to a set of equivalent protons. So, two signals for aromatic H, two for vinyl H, and two for CH3 groups. No CH2 signals. Hmm.

Wait, aromatic protons: two signals. So, the substituents on the benzene ring must lead to two different types of aromatic H. Since it's a di-substituted ring, the substituents could be in the ortho, meta, or para positions. But for the aromatic signals, if the two substituents are in a position that creates symmetry, maybe they have equivalent H. Wait, but the aromatic signals are two, so the substituents are probably in a para position. Because para would give two equivalent sets of aromatic H, if the substituents are symmetrical. But wait, if the substituents are different, then maybe two different sets of H. Hmm.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted. Let's say the substituents are in the para positions. Then, the ring would have two types of H: two H adjacent to each substituent (ortho positions) and two H opposite (para positions to substituents?), wait, no. Wait, for a para-substituted benzene with two groups, the H environments would be: each substituent has two adjacent H (ortho) and one opposite H (para). Wait, but if the substituents are identical, the ring would have two sets of equivalent H. But in this case, the substituents may not be identical because the di-substituted ring is leading to two signals for aromatic H, but maybe they aren't the same, so perhaps the substituents are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the meta positions. Wait, but di-substituted in meta would lead to different H environments. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the substituents.

Since the ester group is present, the substituents might include an ester group. The other substituent could be something else. Let's think: maybe one substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R or something. Wait, no, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R? Wait no, ester structure is R-O-CO-R. So, for example, if one substituent is an ester group, say O-CO-CH2CH3, and the other substituent could be something else, perhaps a methyl group or another group.

Wait, but the NMR says there are two CH3 signals. So there are two different CH3 groups. Also, two vinyl H signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl H usually refers to protons on a double bond, like in an alkene.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. So, benzene ring with two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. Wait, but wait, the vinyl H would come from a substituent like a double bond attached to the ring, such as a substituent like CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is like CH2=CH- attached to the ring. Or perhaps the substituent is a group with a double bond, maybe a coupling with the ester.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R), and the other substituent is a vinyl group attached to a CH3. Hmm, but let me think about the NMR signals.

The NMR has six signals. Let's count the different types of protons.

First, aromatic H: two signals. So two different environments.

Second, vinyl H: two signals, one doublet and one doublet of quartets. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, and a doublet of quartets would suggest coupling with two protons each split into quartets. Hmm, perhaps the substituents have protons in a trans configuration.

Wait, the vinyl H could be from a group like CH2=CH-. So, for example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2 group, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps a substituent like CH2=CHCOOR?

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ether or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a CH2CH3 group attached via a double bond. Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense. Maybe the substituent is a methylene group adjacent to an ester.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and another group, like a propenyl group (CH2CH2CH3?), but more likely, perhaps a substituent like a CH2CH2 group but that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a propenoate group. Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzene with two ester substituents, but that might not fit the NMR data.

Wait, let's think about the ester group. The ester would have a structure like O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl group. So, the R could be CH3, CH2CH3, etc.

Looking at the NMR, there are two CH3 signals. So, perhaps the ester's R group is a CH3, and another CH3 comes from another substituent.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring
