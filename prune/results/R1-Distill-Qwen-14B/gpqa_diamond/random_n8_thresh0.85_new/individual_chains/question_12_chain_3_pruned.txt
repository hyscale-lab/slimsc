Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of kinetic energies.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when a particle at rest decays into two particles, conservation of energy and momentum come into play. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So their momenta should be equal and opposite vectors, meaning their magnitudes are the same.

But wait, neutrinos are really light. I think their rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles. For muons, their rest mass is much smaller than the pion's, but not negligible in this case because the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and the pion is 139.6. So the decay products are the muon and the neutrino, but the neutrino's mass is practically zero.

So, let's think about energy and momentum conservation.

The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

So, conservation of energy:

E_pion = E_mu + E_nu

E_pion = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, the units are in MeV, so probably better to work in units where c=1. So E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p_nu c since m_nu is zero. Wait, but again, if c=1, E_nu = p_nu.

But I think I need to set up the equations properly.

Conservation of momentum: since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So, p_mu + p_nu = 0. Which means p_mu = -p_nu. So, their magnitudes are equal, p_mu = p_nu = p (let's say).

So, p_mu = p, p_nu = p (but in opposite directions, so magnitude same).

Wait, but in terms of vectors, they are opposite. So, their magnitudes are equal. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, each has magnitude p.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Because E_mu = sqrt( p^2
