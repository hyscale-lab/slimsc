--- Full Content ---
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about organic chemistry reactions, specifically some synthesis steps and then an NMR analysis. Hmm, I need to take it step by step.

First, let's look at the starting material: 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1. I remember that when a dihalide like this is treated with KOH, it typically undergoes an elimination reaction, probably E2, which would form an alkene because two bromines are eliminated. So product 1 is probably a diene or an alkene. Wait, but adamantane has a pretty rigid structure, so maybe it's a bridged bicyclic compound. Oh, right, the product from KOH and dibromoadamantane is likely to be 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, I think the structure might be more like 1,3-diketone? Wait, no, KOH usually deprotonates and causes elimination. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the presence of a strong base like KOH, dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming a diene. But wait, the product's NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is probably an -OH group? Or maybe an ester or ketone? Or perhaps an epoxide?

Wait, but the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but something else. Oh wait, wait. Maybe when KOH is used in a different condition. Alternatively, perhaps the base isn't just eliminating but maybe doing something else. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Hmm, could it be a double elimination? For each Br, the KOH would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if both Brs are on the same position, but wait, 1 and 3 are different positions. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Brs on adjacent carbons? No, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe each Br is on a different bridge. So when KOH is added, each Br might eliminate, leading to a conjugated diene? But the product is a light yellow solid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone?

Wait, another possibility: maybe when the dihalide is treated with KOH, it undergoes a substitution reaction. But with excess KOH, probably elimination is more favorable. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, so perhaps there's an oxidation happening. Hmm, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, no, elimination usually forms alkenes. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide? No, because 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh, wait, adamantane's structure is a cage structure, so perhaps the Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1,3 positions are across the ring. So if the molecule is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are on opposite bridgeheads.

When treated with a strong base like KOH, maybe the base deprotonates and causes elimination, but since the Brs are not on adjacent carbons, elimination would form what? Hmm, maybe it's more about the formation of a ketone through some kind of elimination and rearrangement. Wait, perhaps it's an example of dehydrohalogenation leading to a cyclopropane ring opening, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a ketone via a neighboring group participation. Wait, another thought: the product could be 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR peak. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: look at the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm peak is for 2H. That's a singlet, probably an -OH group. Or maybe it's an ester or a ketone, but 4.79 is more upfield for an -OH, but maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone's adjacent CH2. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.79 is a singlet of 2H. Another possibility is that those are two equivalent protons on an oxygen-bearing group, like an ether or an ester. Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so maybe an ester group. But wait, esters have carbonyls around 1740 cm-1, but if it's a ketone, it's around 1700-1750. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a diketone. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. But how? Because KOH is a base, perhaps it's an epoxide ring opening? No, wait, that's when you have an epoxide and treat with a base. Alternatively, the dihalide could undergo oxidation, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but that's for amines. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form an alkyne, but that would require two dehydrohalogenations. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, another angle: the product 1 is an epoxide. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen, forming an epoxide. But would that happen? I'm not sure. Because usually, making an epoxide from a dihalide requires a specific condition, like treatment with a base in an SN2 manner. But with two bromines, perhaps both are replaced, but that would form a ketone if the structure allows. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the product's NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That's a rather high chemical shift, so maybe it's an OCH2 group. Wait, but for an ether, the CH2 would be around 3-4 ppm. An ester's adjacent group? Maybe but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide, but epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm as well, maybe. Wait, but 4.79 is higher, which could be an -OCH2O- group, like in a cyclic ether. But I'm not certain.

Moving on, product 1 is then heated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is being used in a Friedel-Crafts reaction. But wait, what's the structure of product 1? If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 would perhaps acylate something. Alternatively, if product 1 is an epoxide, then maybe it's opening under the influence of the Lewis acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a diketone, heating with Al isopropoxide might not do much, unless there's another functional group. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol. Wait, but KOH and dibromide could give a diol via SN2, but with excess KOH and heat, elimination is more likely.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination to form an alkyne. Because if two HBr molecules are eliminated, you could form an alkyne. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, so that might not fit. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a dihalide that upon elimination forms a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination usually forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a specific elimination where the adjacent groups can form a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when two adjacent Br atoms are present, the base could cause an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that's not the case here. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Brs on 1 and 3, which are not adjacent, so elimination would form a double bond between other positions, not forming a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe the initial step is forming an epoxide. If the dihalide reacts with KOH in such a way that each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would make a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane, but I'm not familiar with how that would proceed.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double SN2 substitution, replacing each Br with an OH, forming a diol. Then, when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps the diol undergoes some kind of elimination or cyclization.

But then, the IR would show an O-H stretch, which is around 3300 cm-1, but the given IR is 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Let me think: If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but each elimination would require a hydrogen adjacent to Br. So maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and elimination leads to a bridgehead double bond, but that's not possible because bridgehead double bonds are usually not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So maybe that can't happen. So perhaps another mechanism.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, but I'm not sure about the mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is forming an epoxide, but I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester. But how? Unless there's an oxygen from somewhere. Hmm. Maybe the KOH is acting as a base, abstracting a proton that's adjacent to one of the Brs, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a carbonyl group. But wait, that would require the structure to allow for such a rearrangement. Like, perhaps it's a pinacol-type rearrangement, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait another thought: maybe the starting material isn't a dihalide but a diol, but no, the initial is 1,3-dibromoadamantane.

Alternatively, perhaps the product 1 is a ketone, and the IR peak is due to the C=O stretch. If that's the case, then the NMR would show no protons near the carbonyl, except perhaps adjacent ones.

Wait, but look at the NMR data: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So the 4.79 is a singlet of 2H, perhaps a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably a set of equivalent bridgehead protons in adamantane, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another set, perhaps from a CH2 group attached to something.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, then perhaps it's 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, a Friedel-Crafts acylation might occur, but that requires an aromatic ring. But adamantane is a polycyclic structure but not aromatic. Hmm, maybe the ketone could undergo some kind of cyclization.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and when heated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a cyclization to form a cyclic ketone or perhaps a lactone? But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester. But how would that form from KOH and a dihalide? I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next steps. Product 2 is formed when product 1 is heated with excess Al isopropoxide. Then, product 2 is ozonolysed at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive workup, leading to product 3.

Ozonolysis of an alkene typically breaks it into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. But since the workup is with dimethyl sulfide, which is a mild reductant, perhaps it prevents the formation of ozonides and instead gives aldehydes or ketones.

So if product 3 has carbonyl groups, but the question is about the NMR of product 3, particularly the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen (excluding those that exchange, like OH).

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's try to outline the steps again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane → heated with KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1, NMR has 4.79 ppm for 2H, and other peaks).

2. Product 1 heated with excess Al isopropoxide → product 2.

3. Product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, then treated with DMS → product 3.

The NMR of product 3 is the focus, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps a Friedel-Crafts alkylation occurs, but adamantane doesn't have aromatic rings. Alternatively, maybe it's an acylation of something else. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH forms an epoxide. But how? Epoxides are typically formed from vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoalkanes) via an SN2 mechanism, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing an elimination to form a conjugated diene, which then undergoes some reaction. But then, the IR would not show a carbonyl. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, another approach: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is for a carbonyl group. So product 1 must have a carbonyl. So how can a dihalide form a carbonyl upon reaction with KOH?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires a peracid, not KOH. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a halogen to be replaced by an O- group, but again, not sure.

Wait! Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about elimination again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. KOH is a strong base, so it's likely causing elimination. If each Br is on a bridgehead, when KOH abstracts a β hydrogen, it would lead to the formation of a double bond. But since the two Brs are not adjacent, perhaps each elimination occurs on separate carbons, leading to a conjugated diene.

Wait, but how would that form a carbonyl group? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a ring-opening to form a carbonyl. For example, if the adamantane structure has a bridge that, upon elimination, becomes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that when the two HBr are eliminated, a carbonyl group is formed. But I'm not sure about the mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone, but I can't imagine how.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopropane ring. If two adjacent carbons each have a Br, elimination could form a cyclopropane ring, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are not adjacent. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm, I'm still stuck on the first step. Maybe I should move on and see if I can figure out the subsequent steps, which might help me backtrack.

So, product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, so it's often used in Friedel-Crafts reactions. Friedel-Crafts acylation requires a ketone or an acyl chloride, and an aromatic ring. But if product 1 is a ketone, then maybe it's being used in a Friedel-Crafts acylation on another ring. But in adamantane, there's no aromatic ring, so perhaps it's being cyclized.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, which can undergo acylation. But I'm not sure.

Then, product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by DMS. Ozonolysis of a diene would cleave it to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Wait, but if product 1 is a carbonyl compound, how does product 2 get a double bond? Maybe product 1 undergoes some reaction with Al isopropoxide to form an alkene. For example, perhaps it's a dehydration reaction, forming an alkene from a diol or some other structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when heated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes elimination to form an alkene. Then product 2 would be an alkene, which upon ozonolysis would break into carbonyl compounds.

But wait, the initial product 1's IR has a carbonyl, which wouldn't fit with a diol. So that's contradictory.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should think about product 3's NMR. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

If product 3 is the result of ozonolysis of product 2, which has a double bond, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The most deshielded H would be adjacent to the carbonyl, perhaps in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Wait, but in ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each end becomes a carbonyl group. So if the starting double bond was between carbons 2 and 3, then each fragment would have a carbonyl.

Wait, but in the NMR, the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So in product 3, perhaps there's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, making those Hs deshielded.

So in that case, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyl would be split due to coupling with neighboring Hs. Let's think: if the CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl, then each H on the CH2 would be coupled with the adjacent Hs. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would have coupling with two Hs on each neighboring group.

Wait, but the coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs. If the Hs are on a CH2 group next to another CH2, each H would have coupling with two Hs on each side. For example, if each H is split by two adjacent Hs on one side and two on the other, that could lead to a triplet of triplets. But that's probably more complex.

Alternatively, if the Hs are on a CH2 group next to a CH group, the splitting would be different.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the product is typically two carbonyl groups, each with their own R groups. So maybe in product 3, there's a carbonyl group with adjacent Hs. For example, in a structure like RCOCH2CH2COOR', the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have Hs that are split.

Wait, but let's think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is an alkene, say, CH2=CH. Ozonolysis would split it into two carbonyls, like O=CH and CH=O. But if the alkene is part of a larger structure, like CH2-CH2 in the middle of a chain, then ozonolysis would create two carbonyls. For example, if the alkene is in the middle of a chain, like R-CH2-CH2-R', ozone would cleave it into R-CHO and R'-CHO.

But wait, another scenario: if the alkene is part of a cyclic structure, say, a cyclopropane ring with a double bond? No, that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe the alkene is exocyclic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is of a bridged bicyclic compound, leading to a diketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH2 group is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. For example, if the ozonolysis produces a geminal diacid or something similar, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone with a CH2 group between two carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis produces a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Then, the CH2 groups would each have two neighboring Hs. Each H on the CH2 would be split by the neighboring Hs. So each H would be a quartet if they're next to another CH2 with two Hs. Wait, no, wait: if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, then each H is next to two Hs on one side and two on the other. So each H would have coupling with four Hs, leading to a pentet.

Wait, but in reality, the splitting might be more complex. For instance, each H would couple with two Hs on one adjacent CH2 and two on the other, leading to multiple splits. But perhaps in this case, the splitting is a triplet of triplets, which is when each H is split by two different sets of adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 group next to a single CH group, which would lead to a doublet of doublets.

Wait, but let me think about the specific splitting. Imagine a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. Each CH2 is between two carbonyls. The middle CH2 would have two CH2 groups on either side. So each H on the middle CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other. So each H would split into a triplet from each adjacent CH2. But because the two couplings are similar, it could result in a triplet of triplets. Or perhaps it's a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if each CH2 is only next to one other CH2, then each H would have a coupling with two Hs, leading to a triplet. But that would require a structure where each CH2 is only adjacent on one side.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a simple diethyl ketone, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, think about the ozonolysis product as two separate carbonyl compounds. Let's say product 2 had a double bond between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups, giving two aldehyde protons. But in that case, the aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm, which is more deshielded. But the question is about the most deshielded H, which could be the aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they don't have neighboring Hs. But in the options, there's no singlet. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the structure is more complex. Suppose product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the bridge, leading to smaller fragments with carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to approach it differently. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

In a typical ozonolysis product, each carbonyl is at the end of a chain. So if the starting alkene was, say, CH2=CH, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. But if the alkene is part of a larger structure, the carbonyl groups might be in the middle.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure. Suppose product 2 is a cyclopropane with an exocyclic double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, leading to a diketone.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure like CH2(CO)CH2CO, which would have CH2 groups next to carbonyls.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group, and that CH2 is next to another CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have coupling constants of J1 and J2, resulting in a triplet of triplets. Or maybe a doublet of triplets. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the H is part of a CH2 group next to a single CH group, then each H would couple with two Hs (from CH2) and one H (from CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, or something like that.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, which is adjacent to another CH2. So each H on the CH2 would have coupling with two Hs (from their own CH2) and one H (from the adjacent CH). So the splitting would be a triplet of doublets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, making them deshielded. Then, each H would couple with two Hs on either side. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: in the NMR of product 3, what kind of splitting would occur for Hs adjacent to a carbonyl? Let's say the Hs are on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. If the adjacent group is another CH2, then each H would have coupling with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would be split by two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets. But wait, that would require four neighboring Hs, but in reality, the coupling would be between adjacent groups. Alternatively, each H would couple with two Hs from one side and two from the other, leading to a triplet from each coupling, resulting in a triplet of triplets.

So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets. Looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each H is only adjacent to two Hs, it would be a triplet. But if there are two sets of two Hs adjacent, it would be a triplet of triplets.

So perhaps the correct answer is B) triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a multi-step organic synthesis and analysis of the final product using NMR spectroscopy. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH**  
   The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, is treated with KOH at 240°C. This likely results in a double elimination (E2 mechanism), forming a conjugated diene. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the diene formed is further oxidized or rearranged to form a diketone, specifically 1,3-diketone adamantane.

2. **Step 2: Reaction of product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide**  
   Product 1 (1,3-diketone adamantane) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid. This step likely facilitates a cyclization or rearrangement, forming product 2. The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred to contain a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step suggests the presence of an alkene.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis of product 2**  
   Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by a reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. Thus, product 3 is a compound containing carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Analysis of the NMR spectrum of product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group flanked by two carbonyl groups. Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group couples with two hydrogens on one side and two hydrogens on the other side, resulting in a splitting pattern of a **triplet of triplets**.

Given the coupling pattern described, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
