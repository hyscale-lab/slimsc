Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, the problem mentions it's relativistic, so I guess relativity comes into play here.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a different formula involving k, A, m, and the speed of light c. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the classical case, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. But relativistic effects probably modify this. Oh right, in relativity, as speeds approach the speed of light, the mass increases due to gamma (Lorentz factor), which is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the equations of motion must change when velocities get significant compared to c.

The potential in a harmonic oscillator is U = ½ k x². In the relativistic scenario, the total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the problem says it's a 1D oscillator obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx. I remember that in the relativistic case, the equations of motion are more complicated because the forces are related to derivatives of the potential which might involve relativistic terms.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy. The total energy E of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest mass energy (mc²) and the potential energy when the mass is at the maximum amplitude A. Because at maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so all energy is potential.

So, the total energy E = mc² + ½ k A². But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total energy is gamma mc². So perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy. Wait, or is it that the potential energy is part of the total energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy E is (gamma) mc² plus the potential energy U. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So, when the mass is at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so gamma is 1, and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the total energy E should equal the potential energy at A plus the rest energy.

Wait, no. Wait, the rest energy is mc², and the potential energy is ½ k A². So E = mc² + (1/2) k A². But when the mass is moving, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So at some point, the kinetic energy plus potential equals the total energy.

But wait, when the oscillator is at maximum speed, the displacement is zero, so the potential energy is zero. Then, the kinetic energy would be E - rest energy? Or am I getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to write down the conservation of energy. At maximum amplitude A, the mass is at rest (momentarily), so kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is ½ k A². So total energy E = ½ k A² + mc².

But when the mass is moving through equilibrium (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E - mc², because at equilibrium, potential is zero, so E = kinetic + mc².

Wait, no. Wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc². So, if the total energy is E = gamma mc², and at maximum displacement x=A, the speed is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = mc² + ½ k A².

At maximum speed, the potential is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. So, kinetic energy is E - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc². So,

E = mc² + (1/2) k A².

At maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic:

gamma mc² - mc² = (1/2) k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but let me check another approach. Maybe the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is different. I think the force is given by F = -dU/dx, and since relativistic dynamics involves F = dp/dt, where p is relativistic momentum.

Wait, the Newtonian equation for a harmonic oscillator is F = -kx = m d²x/dt². In relativistic mechanics, it's more complicated. The momentum p is gamma m v, so F = d p/dt = d/dt (gamma m v) = m gamma v + m v d(gamma)/dt. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using energy conservation is the easier approach. So, E = gamma mc² + ½ k x². At maximum displacement A, v is zero, so E = mc² + ½ k A². At maximum speed, x is zero, so E = gamma mc².

Setting these equal:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait
