Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, which probably matters for activity coefficients but maybe it's not needed here. The Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

Hmm. I remember that orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is the conjugate base of HPO4^2- from the third dissociation of phosphoric acid. But wait, the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. So I need to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, but we're adding two different salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are phosphate salts, but they might form different species in solution. Let me think.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When dissolved, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So it contributes H2PO4^- to the solution.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Upon dissolving, it should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So this contributes HPO4^2-.

But wait, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can undergo further dissociation in water. The phosphate species in solution depend on the pH.

Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociation steps:
1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12

So the possible species in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-. But given the salts we have, the initial ions are H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4).

But when these are in solution together, they can interconvert. So the solution will be a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because both are present. Wait, but wait: Since H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

But wait, the given K values are very small for the third dissociation, meaning that PO4^3- is very little
