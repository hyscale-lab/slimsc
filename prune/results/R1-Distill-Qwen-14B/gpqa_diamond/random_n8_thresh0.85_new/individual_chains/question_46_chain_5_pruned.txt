Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, not counting ethene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is involved in some kind of ring-closing metathesis. Right, metathesis is a reaction where the catalyst facilitates the redistribution of alkene fragments.

Wait, so the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3). Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the pentene has five carbons, with the double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula for pent is C5H10. But 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)2? Wait, no. Let me count. The structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂- something? Wait, no. Let's think again. The parent chain is pentene, so five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituent is a methyl group on C3.

So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2
