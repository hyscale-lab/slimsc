Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. Got it. So the nucleus in question is ^6Li.

The question is about the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often what's discussed, but I'm not entirely sure if the problem is asking for total energy or just kinetic. Oh wait, the question says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." Hmm, maybe it's the total energy, because in relativity, energy includes rest mass energy. But I'm not entirely certain. I'll have to think about that.

The speed given is 0.96 times the speed of light. That's pretty fast! So relativistic effects are definitely in play here. I remember that when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, you can't use classical mechanics. We'll need to use the theory of relativity, specifically the Lorentz factor.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's calculate that first. v is 0.96c. Plugging that in:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2 ) 
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)
= 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216)
= 1 / sqrt(0.0784)
Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Let's compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857. Let's say about 3.5714 for now.

Next, I think I need the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. Because in particle accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic energy, but sometimes people refer to the total energy. Wait, but the RHIC's energy is given in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So I need to compute the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

Wait, but let me make sure. The energy in the lab frame is the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Because E = gamma mc². So I'll need the rest mass energy of the ^6Li nucleus.

The rest mass energy of a nucleus is given by E_rest = m * c², where m is the mass of the nucleus. For a nucleus with A nucleons, the mass is A times the mass of a nucleon. Wait, but I think I should use the atomic mass unit (u). One atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Alternatively, 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². Oh right, because 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c². So I can calculate the rest mass energy in MeV and then convert to GeV.

So for ^6Li, the mass number A is 6. The mass is 6 * 1 u. So E_rest = 6 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV. Wait, 6 times 900 is 5400, plus 6 times 31.5 is 189, so 5400+189=5589 MeV. So that's 5.589 GeV.

Wait, hold on. Wait, 931.5 MeV is per u. So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 = let me double-check: 6*900 is 5400, 6*31.5 is 189, total 5589 MeV. So 5.589 GeV. That's the rest
