Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That usually involves chirality, which requires a chiral center. Or maybe it's about geometric isomerism, like in some double bonds or rings.

The question gives four compounds, and I need to determine which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations. Let's go through each one.

Number 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can have different arrangements. Wait, what's the structure here? Biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. If the substituents are in the same position on each ring, but arranged differently, like in para positions, would that lead to cis and trans isomerism? Oh wait, that's about whether the groups are on the same side or opposite sides of the single bond. Alternatively, if there's a chiral center, then optical isomerism could occur. But I need to check if this structure has any centers with four different substituents.

Looking at this compound, each benzene ring has two nitro groups and two ester groups? Wait, each ring has two substituentsâ€”2-carboxylate and 6-nitro? Or no, wait 6,6' are the positions, and 2,2' are the others. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. But in a biphenyl structure, the substituents on each ring are in positions that could lead to cis or trans arrangements. For example, if the two rings are connected, substituents could be on the same side (cis) or opposite (trans). But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about mirror images, not geometric isomerism. Unless the molecule has a plane of symmetry. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the substituent arrangement creates a chiral center elsewhere. But I don't think so because the central bond (the single bond between the two benzene rings) can rotate, so even if the substituents are in certain positions, the molecule might not have chirality. Wait, but if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, maybe there's a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. I'm not entirely sure about this one yet. Maybe I'll come back to it.

Number 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me write the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the propanoate is CH2CH(O-)COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3. When it's esterified as methyl ester, it's CH2CH(O-)COOCH3. Wait, no. Let me correct that. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the ester would be CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) has three different groups attached: two CH3 (from the adjacent carbons?), wait, no. Let me see: the structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-H. Wait, wait, no. Let's count. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain, right? So the structure is:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH ?

Wait, maybe I should draw it. The ester is O-CO-OCH3 attached to the second carbon of propane. The second carbon also has an OH and a CH3 group. So the molecule would be CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-H. Wait, so the central carbon (the second carbon)
