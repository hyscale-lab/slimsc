Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I should probably analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond or ring (another 1), and maybe an amine or carbonyl group (another 1). Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (1), making 5. That adds up.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, but they are deshielded. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton in a strongly deshielded environment? Or maybe an acidic proton like an alcohol or a phenol? But phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm or so, unless it's an enol. Wait, 9.72 is a triplet. Hmm, maybe an aldehyde? But aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they don't have neighboring Hs.

Wait another thought: maybe it's an enol tautomer. Enol protons are around 5-7 ppm, but maybe if it's a conjugated system, could it be higher? Or perhaps it's not an aldehyde. Another possibility is an amide or something else. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde is present, but perhaps the splitting is due to coupling with something else, like neighboring Hs.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 for 1H could be an aldehyde. Maybe it's coupled to two equivalent protons. Wait, but aldehyde H can't have neighboring Hs because it's a terminal group. Unless it's in a conjugated system, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. But then the aldehyde proton would be a singlet, right? Because it's next to a double bond, but the Hs on the double bond are not adjacent to the aldehyde H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe that's a phenolic OH? No, because phenols are usually broad around 5-6 ppm. Wait, but someone might forget and think it's an aldehyde. So perhaps I should think about that.

Next, the NMR data: another peak at 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Let's think about the aromatic regions. The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets each for 2H suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para-substituted benzene, you get a pair of doublets for two equivalent Hs. So maybe the starting compound has two para-substituted aromatic rings attached to something else.

Looking at the 6.27 (bs, 2H), broad signal. That could be another set of aromatic protons, perhaps in a more deshielded environment, or maybe a conjugated system.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) suggests two equivalent protons, probably on a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an oxygen, like an ether or a carbonyl. The splitting is a doublet, so each H is next to
