Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup says it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The options are all different expressions involving m, k, A, and the speed of light c. So I need to figure out the right formula.

Wait, I remember that in the classical (non-relativistic) case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kA², so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C, but wait, the question is relativistic, so that's probably not the right answer here.

In relativity, things get more complicated because as speeds approach the speed of light, you can't use classical mechanics anymore. The relativistic equations of motion and energy come into play. The total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of a moving particle is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the system has both kinetic and potential energy. At maximum speed, the potential energy must be at its maximum, which in the classical case is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, energy is conserved, and I think the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the total energy would have to account for relativistic effects.

Wait, the oscillator is subject to a force F = -kx, which is the same as the classical case. But the equation of motion in relativity isn't the same. Oh right, the relativistic harmonic oscillator equation is more complicated. Let me recall. The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is (d²x/dt²) + (k/m) x = 0, but considering relativistic mass? Or wait, maybe that's not accurate. Because in relativity, the mass increases with velocity, so the equation might have a velocity-dependent term.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² (max potential) plus the rest energy, but wait, no, because at maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At maximum speed, the potential energy would be zero (x=0), and all energy is kinetic. Wait, no. Wait, in SHM, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes (x=A) and zero at x=0.

Wait, no, wait. In SHM, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², so it's maximum at x = A, and zero at x=0. So when the oscillator is at x=A, all energy is potential, and when it's at x=0, all energy is kinetic.

So in the relativistic case, the total energy at x=A is
