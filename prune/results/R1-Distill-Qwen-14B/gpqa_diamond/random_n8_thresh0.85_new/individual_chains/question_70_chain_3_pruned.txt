Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem describes several reactions, and we're supposed to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, molecular symmetry groups... I remember that these are related to the point group of a molecule, which describes its symmetry. So, first, I need to figure out what E is.

Let's break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 

Wait, equivalents might indicate the stoichiometry. So 8 equivalents could mean that the reaction has a formula like A + 8B → C. What compounds react in high ratios like that? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with oxygen? Or perhaps a transition metal with another element. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-base reaction.

Wait, product C is bright red. That makes me think of compounds like Fe(OH)3, but that's a precipitate. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal sulfide or oxide. Oh wait, another bright red compound is lead dioxide, PbO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like CuO but that's black. Wait, maybe it's Mercury(II) oxide? No, that's red or black? I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or sulfate? Not sure yet.

Next reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.

Hmm, if C is reacting with gas D in a 1:2 ratio, perhaps gas D is something like O2. Wait, but let me think. If C is a metal oxide, reacting with D (maybe H2 or another gas), but E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, maybe D is a halogen, like Cl2? Or maybe another gas like H2S?

Wait, another thought: if C is a metal oxide, reacting with D (which might be Cl2), could produce a metal chloride, but that may not be extremely hazardous unless it's something like HCl or a toxic gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide or another compound that reacts with D to form something dangerous.

Wait, but let's hold that thought and look at the next reaction.

C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So when C (the product from A and B) reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. F is strong, G is weak. Common strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids are like acetic acid, H3PO4, etc.

So, let's think about a metal oxide reacting with water to form a metal hydroxide and an acid. Wait, no, wait. If C is a metal oxide, like say CuO, and it reacts with water, we'd get Cu(OH)2, but that doesn't produce acids. Wait, unless C is a non-metal oxide, like perhaps a sulfur compound.

Wait another possibility: when a metal nitride reacts with water, it produces NH3 and a metal hydroxide. But that doesn't form acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide? For example, if C is FeS, reacting with water might not produce much. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, let me think again. The reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. F and G are acids. So maybe C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride or another compound that when hydrolyzed forms NH3 and a base, but that's not acids. Wait, maybe C is a metal oxide that's more basic than water, so reacting with water would produce a strong base, but that's not acids. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps C is a metal carbonate. When it reacts with water, it might not change much. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate or phosphate, but that doesn't immediately suggest acid formation.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if A is H2S and B is O2, but no, the initial reaction is solid A with B. Alternatively, maybe A is FeS and B is O2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal oxide, and when it reacts with water, it undergoes hydrolysis to form a strong acid and a weak acid. Oh wait! Maybe C is a sulfite or something similar. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if B is nitrogen, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe C is a peroxide, like PbO2. When PbO2 reacts with water, I don't think it produces acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reactions in order. Let me try to assign possible compounds to each step.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C (bright red). Let me think about what reacts in an 8:1 molar ratio. Maybe lead (Pb) reacting with something. For example, PbO2 is a bright red compound. How is PbO2 formed? Maybe through oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps A is PbS, but I'm not sure. Wait, if A is PbS and B is O2, then PbS + O2 → PbO2 and SO2? But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe A is FeS and B is O2, but FeO isn't bright red.

Wait, another possibility: maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. For example, sodium (Na) reacting with chlorine (Cl2) to form NaCl. But in this case, the stoichiometry would be 2 equivalents of Cl2 per Na. But the first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B, which is a gas. So maybe B is Cl2, but 8 equivalents would imply 4 moles of Cl
