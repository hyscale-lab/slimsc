Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, for a given state. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the matrix representation of P_z is diagonal, right? Because P_z is given in its own eigenbasis. So that should make calculations easier because the matrix is diagonal.

Looking at the matrix for P_z: the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The basis vectors are |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩, corresponding to these eigenvalues.

Wait, the state is given as a vector in this basis. So the state is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let me write the state vector:

The state is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So in terms of the basis vectors, it's (-1/2)|1⟩ + (1/√2)|2⟩ + (-1/2)|3⟩.

Wait, but to compute the expectation values, I can use the components of the state in the eigenbasis of P_z. Because in this basis, the operator P_z is diagonal, so the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of each component's contribution, weighted by the square of the amplitude for that eigenstate.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = |a_1|^2 * (ħ) + |a_2|^2 * 0 + |a_3|^2 * (-ħ).

Let me compute each |a_i|^2. The components are a1 = -1/2, a2 = 1/√2, a3 = -1/2.

|a1|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|a2|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|a3|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So plugging into ⟨P_z⟩:

= (1/4) * ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ)
= (1/4 - 1/4) ħ
= 0.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero. That might be useful.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements.

So the matrix P_z squared would have entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 → so (ħ², 0, ħ²) on the diagonal.

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is sum of |a_i|^2 times (diagonal elements of P_z squared).

So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = |a1|^2 * (ħ²) + |a2|^2 * 0 + |a3|^2 * (ħ²)
= (1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) * ħ²
= (1/4 + 1/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² )

We already found ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so that simplifies it to sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Because the state is a vector in the P_z basis, so the expectation of P_z is as I computed. And for P_z squared, same approach.

Yes, so the uncertainty should be sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) → ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B. So the answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The state of the system is given as a column vector in the eigenbasis of $P_z$:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in its eigenbasis, with diagonal entries $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left| a_1 \right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left| a_2 \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| a_3 \right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]

where the components of the state are $a_1 = -\frac{1}{2}$, $a_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $a_3 = -\frac{1}{2}$. The probabilities are:

\[
\left| a_1 \right|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \left| a_2 \right|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \left| a_3 \right|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with diagonal entries $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left| a_1 \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left| a_2 \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| a_3 \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
