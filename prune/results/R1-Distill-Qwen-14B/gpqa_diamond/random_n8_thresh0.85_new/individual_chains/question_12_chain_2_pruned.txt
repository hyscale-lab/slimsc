Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that a Pi(+) particle is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, and the neutrino's rest mass? Hmm, I remember that neutrinos are almost massless. So for these purposes, maybe I can consider its rest mass as zero. That might simplify things.

So the decay is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

I think I should use conservation of energy and momentum here. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass, so its energy will be its rest energy plus kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero.

Let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu = 0 (approximate)

Energy conservation equation:
m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu

Momentum conservation: since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So the momenta of mu and nu must be equal and opposite. Let's denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, then the neutrino's momentum is also p (same magnitude, opposite direction, so in vector terms, they cancel out). 

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no. Wait, the energy of a particle is E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). But in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics, E = sqrt(p² + m²). So I can work in natural units where c=1 to simplify.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² )

E_nu = p, because for a massless particle, E = |p|.

So the energy equation becomes:
m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p

Let me set m_pi = M, m_mu = m. Then,

M = sqrt(p² + m²) + p

I can rearrange this equation to solve for p. Let me subtract p from both sides:

M - p = sqrt(p² + m²)

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(M - p)^2 = p² + m²

Expanding the left side:

M² - 2 M p + p² = p² + m²

Subtract p² from both sides:

M² - 2 M p = m²

Rearrange to solve for p:

-2 M p = m² - M²

p = (M² - m²)/(2 M)

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that algebra.

Wait, M² - 2 M p + p² = p² + m²

Subtract p² from both sides: M² -2 M p = m².

Then, bring the m² to the left: M² - m² = 2 M p

So p = (M² - m²)/(2 M )

But wait, M is 139.6 MeV, and m is 105.7 MeV. Let me compute M² and m².

M =139.6, so M² ≈ (139.6)^2. Let me calculate that.

139.6 * 139.6: I can approximate it as (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

m =105.7 → m² is 105.7^2 = approx (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

So M² - m² = 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then p = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6 )

Calculate denominator: 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So p ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that. 

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So maybe around 29.8 ?

Wait, 279.2 *29= 8096.8. 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783.

So p ≈ 29.783 ≈ 29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, that's the value of p. So the neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.8 MeV.

But wait, neutrinos have E = p c, but in our units (c=1), E = p.

So E_nu = 29.8 MeV. That's the kinetic energy of the neutrino, since its rest mass is zero. So K_nu = E_nu = 29.8 MeV.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculate 29.8²: approx 888.04.

105.7² is 11172.49.

So sum is 888.04 + 11172.49 = 12060.53.

Square root of 12060.53: let's see, 110^2=12100. So sqrt(12060.53) is about 109.8 (since 109.8^2 = approx 12056). Close enough.

So E_mu ≈ 109.8 MeV.

The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu c² (since E = K + m c²). So K_mu = 109.8 - 105.7 = approx 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches our estimates. So the KE of the muon is ~4.12 MeV and the neutrino is ~29.8 MeV.

Let me check the options:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → no, doesn't match.

B) 7.2, 32.8 → no.

C)3.52,20.8 → no.

D)4.12,29.8 → yes.

So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a math error.

Wait, when I calculated p, I got 8315.67 / 279.2 = ?

Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2 more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8. Subtract that from 8315.67: 8315.67 -8096.8 = 218.87.

Now, 218.87 / 279.2 = approximately 0.783.

So 29.783 → about 29.78, which is 29.8.

So E_nu =29.8 MeV
