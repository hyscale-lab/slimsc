Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab?

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is usually given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the medium here is moving. So does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light inside it as observed in the lab frame?

Let me think about how velocities add up in different reference frames. Oh right, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1*v2)/cÂ²). But wait, does that apply here? Because the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving.

Wait, but the light is inside the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the direction of the beam. But from the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, what is the observed speed of the light?

Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving toward the observer. So the lab frame is the one where the glass is moving. But in the glass frame, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So I think we need to apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because the lab is the observer's frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. In the glass frame, the light has a speed of v_light = c/n, right? Because in its rest frame, light travels at c/n.

But wait, wait. No, wait a second. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n in the direction of propagation. The glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. Oh wait, that's a key point. So regardless of the motion of the medium, the speed of light in the lab frame is always c. But wait, that can't be right because the medium here is moving. Or is it?

Wait, no. In special relativity, the speed of light in a medium is different from the speed of light in a vacuum. Wait, no, no. Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

In special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame. But when a medium is present, like glass, the speed of light inside the medium is different. But how does the motion of the medium affect the observed speed of light in the medium from another frame?

Wait, no. The speed of light in the medium is determined by the medium's properties regardless of the motion of the medium. But when you change frames, velocities transform. So the question is about the speed of the light beam relative to the lab when the glass is moving.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving
