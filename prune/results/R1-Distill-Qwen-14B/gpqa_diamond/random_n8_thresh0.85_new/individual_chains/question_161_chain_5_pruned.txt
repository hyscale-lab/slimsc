Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Hmm, I remember that in electron microscopy, the vacuum is super important because any gas molecules can interfere with the electrons. But wait, the question says Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. So the gas particles are really sparse, right?

He measured the mean free path as λ1 before the electron beam was on. The mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. I think the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter, and p is pressure. Oh wait, isn't there another formula involving the number density? Yeah, λ = 1/(n*σ), where n is number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So n is proportional to pressure over (k*T), because n = p/(k*T), assuming ideal gas.

But when Mike turned on the electron beam, he noticed that the mean free path changed to λ2. The question states that the temperature remained the same, so T is the same. What could cause the mean free path to change then?

Wait, maybe the electron beam affects the gas molecules. If the electrons are hitting the gas atoms, perhaps they cause some sort of ionization or heating. Oh, but the temperature is the same, so maybe that's not it.

Another thought: gas molecules in the presence of an electron beam might get charged. If they become ions, their behavior changes. Charged particles would interact differently with the electron beam. Do they get accelerated or deflected? I'm not sure, but if the gas molecules become charged, like ions, their mean free path might change because they now have different cross-sections for collisions.

Wait, but if the gas is at a very low pressure, like less than 1e-9 Torr, the mean free path λ1 is already very long. Because at low pressure, the mean free path increases. So λ1 is large. Now, when the electron beam is on, does it cause the gas to ionize? If so, maybe the ions are moving faster or have different collision properties.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes gas molecules to scatter more or less effectively. So if the gas is neutral, the electrons might not interact much with them. But if the gas becomes ionized, the interactions could be more frequent
