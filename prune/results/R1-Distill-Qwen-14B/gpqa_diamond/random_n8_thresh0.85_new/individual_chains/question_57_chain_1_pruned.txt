Okay, so I have this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember from my notes that phase shifts are involved in scattering amplitudes, especially in partial wave expansions. 

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The problem says to ignore the rest, so I guess higher l values beyond δ₄ aren't considered here. 

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves. Each term involves the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. But wait, when calculating the amplitude along the incident direction, which is θ=0°, I think some terms might simplify because cosθ becomes 1. 

The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is something like f(θ) = sum from l=0 to ∞ of (2l +1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) / (2ik) ] P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since we're looking at the imaginary part along the incident direction (θ=0), maybe some terms vanish or simplify because P_l(1) has certain properties.

Let me think about the Legendre polynomials at θ=0. P₀(1) is 1, P₁(1) is 1, P₂(1)= (1/2)(3) ... wait, no, P_2(1) is (3(1)^2 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1? No, wait no, wait, Legendre polynomials evaluated at x=1: P_l(1) is 1 for any l. Because all the terms in the expansion add up to 1. So each term in the sum for f(θ=0) would involve (2l+1) * (e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik). 

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

But wait, f(θ) is usually a complex quantity. So each term contributes to the real and imaginary parts. 

Wait, but along θ=0, the expression simplifies. Let's consider each term for l from 0 to 4.

The general term is (2l+1)[ (e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik) ] * P_l(1) 

Since P_l(1)=1, each term becomes (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik). 

Let me compute each term:

For l=0: (2*0 +1)=1. e^{2iδ_0} where δ_0=90°, so 2δ_0=180°, e^{iπ} = -1. So e^{2iδ_0} -1 = (-1) -1 = -2. So term is (1)(-2)/(2ik) = (-2)/(2ik) = (-1)/(ik).

Wait, but ik is i times k. Let me compute (e^{2iδ_l} -1)/(2ik) as (e^{i(2δ_l)} -1)/(2ik). 

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me compute each term's imaginary part. 

Because f(θ=0) will be the sum of these terms. But each term can be expressed as (2l+1)/(2ik) [e^{2iδ_l} -1].

So, let's write each term as (2l+1)/(2ik) * [cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) -1 ].

Which is (2l+1)/(2ik) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ].

Since we're summing terms, the imaginary part of each term would be (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l).

Wait, because when you separate the real and imaginary parts:
