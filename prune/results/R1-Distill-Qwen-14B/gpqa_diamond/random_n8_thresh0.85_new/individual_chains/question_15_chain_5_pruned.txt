Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me see. So, the question is about which planet is more likely to transit its star from our point of view, so that the researchers should observe that one first.

The setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, P1 has a period P, P2 has 3P. Both orbits are circular, which probably simplifies things.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are bigger, but in this case, same radius. So, maybe they're in different evolutionary stages or somethingâ€”Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, maybe a subgiant or something, but same size as Planet_1's host. 

The question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet's orbit and the star. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but maybe scaled by something else.

Wait, I think the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, actually, the probability is higher when the semi-major axis is larger because the planet has a higher chance of passing in front of the star. But actually, no, wait: the closer the planet is (smaller a), the higher the probability because the orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on. Or is it the opposite?

Wait no, I think I'm getting confused. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. For a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be aligned such that the planet passes directly in front of the star from our point of view. The probability of this happening is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think.

The transit probability (P) can be approximated as (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a
