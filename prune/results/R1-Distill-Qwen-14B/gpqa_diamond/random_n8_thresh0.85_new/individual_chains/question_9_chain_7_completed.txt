Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the various planes and axes that leave the molecule looking the same after certain operations. The notation C3h, I think, refers to a type of symmetry involving a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, the h in C3h stands for horizontal, right? So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me think about each option and their structures.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Wait, the name is a bit complicated. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. Trifuran would mean three furan rings, I think. And the numbering is a bit tricky. I'm picturing a structure with three phenyl groups attached to a central part, possibly a tricyclic system. The substitution pattern might be symmetric. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the symmetry here. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, maybe it could have a three-fold axis. But wait, the h in C3h suggests a horizontal mirror plane as well.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This one also has a benzo part, so a benzene ring. The trifuran indicates three furan rings attached. The numbering might be such that the substituents are in a symmetric pattern. I'm trying to visualize it. Maybe it's like a central tricyclic structure with benzene rings attached in a symmetrical way. But I'm not certain. Maybe benzene rings are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold axis?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. So this is (i-Pr)3BO, right? The structure is a borate with three isopropyl groups attached to the boron. So the molecule is trigonal planar around the boron. Wait, each isopropyl group is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So, all three substituents are the same. So the structure should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Let's see: if you look along the B atom, each substituent is the same, so rotating 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. But what about a mirror plane? If the molecule is non-planar, maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular to the B-atom's plane. Wait, the borate ion is trigonal planar, so the molecule is flat. So, a horizontal mirror plane would bisect the molecule. So, looking at this, triisopropyl borate has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), so it should have C3h symmetry. Hmm, so option C could be the answer.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic structure, I think. It has a bridge structure between two rings. The structure is a norbornane-like compound, which is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Wait, but wait, I think quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane? Or maybe a different structure. Anyway, the key is that quinuclidine has a structure with a bridge, and the symmetry would depend on how the substituents are arranged. Quinuclidine itself is a secondary amine with a bridge. I don't think it has a three-fold symmetry. The molecule is more symmetric around a two-fold axis perhaps. So maybe it doesn't have C3h symmetry.

So, let me recap. The question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry. 

Option C is triisopropyl borate. The structure is (i-Pr)3B-O-. B is at the center with three identical isopropyl groups. So, the molecule is trigonal planar around B, so rotation by 120 degrees would leave the molecule the same. Now, the molecule is flat, so a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron and the oxygen. Wait, but where is the oxygen? In the borate ion, the structure is like a trigonal planar with the boron in the center, three OR groups (like O-R attached). So, the borate would have a trigonal planar geometry. So, in (i-Pr)3BO-, the molecule is trigonal planar, so it has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh), so C3h symmetry.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate (like B(OiPr)3) has the boron in the center with three isopropyl oxygen groups. The molecule would have the trigonal planar structure. So, rotating 120 degrees would make it the same. And a mirror plane perpendicular to the plane of B-O groups, perhaps. So yes, it has C3h symmetry.

Looking at the options, option C is triisopropyl borate, which I'm thinking has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me think again. For option A and B, the structures are more complex with fused rings. For instance, triphenylene has a structure with three benzene rings connected in a way that might allow for a three-fold symmetry. Wait, triphenylene is a well-known symmetric molecule. Triphenylene is a tricyclic compound where three benzene rings are connected in a symmetric fashion. So, does triphenylene have C3h symmetry?

Triphenylene's structure is such that it has a central three-fold axis. The molecule is symmetric with a three-fold rotation. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane, so C3h symmetry.

So, if option A is triphenyleno... something, perhaps its structure includes triphenylene as a part. Let me look at the name again: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Hmm, okay, maybe it's a fused ring system where three phenyl groups are attached to a central tricyclic furan system. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is triphenylene fused with three furans. Wait, but in any case, if the substituents are symmetrically placed around a central point, it could have a three-fold axis.

Wait, but I'm not as sure about that. Triphenylene itself is symmetric, but when you attach other groups, like furans or ketones, the symmetry might change. For example, the hexaone part indicates ketone groups, so perhaps there are six ketone groups in the structure. Wait, the name says hexaone, but the positions are 1,3,6,8,11,13. So, that's a lot of substituents. I'm not sure if that would preserve the three-fold symmetry.

Alternatively, if the molecule has three-fold symmetry with a horizontal mirror plane, it would have C3h. So, triphenylene's core might have that symmetry, but the substituents might disrupt it. But if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, it could maintain the symmetry.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate is a simple molecule with three identical groups, making it straightforward to have C3h symmetry. So, maybe option C is correct.

But wait, the options are a bit different. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[...]trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So, the question is which has C3h symmetry.

If option C is triisopropyl borate, it has the three-fold symmetry plus a horizontal mirror plane, so C3h.

So, the answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, sometimes in such questions, the symmetry might be higher, but I'm not sure. Wait, could any of the other options have C3h symmetry?

Option D, quinuclidine, I think is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge. Its structure is something like bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane. Wait, no, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivative, with an NH group. So, the molecule is symmetric with a two-fold axis, perhaps. I'm not sure if it has a three-fold axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Probably not C3h.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure is a central trifuran with benzene rings attached. The substituents are probably in a way that doesn't allow for a three-fold symmetry. Or perhaps it's arranged so that the substituents are in a symmetric pattern. But I'm not certain.

Option A is triphenyleno attached to a trifuran. So, perhaps the central part is the trifuran, and the triphenylene is fused to it in a symmetric way. But I'm not confident about that.

Wait, but the key is that triisopropyl borate has three identical groups arranged symmetrically, which gives C3h symmetry. So, the answer is option C.

But wait, looking back, the question is which molecule has C3h symmetry. So, I think option C is correct.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry properties of each option. **C₃h** symmetry involves a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σᵢ). This means the molecule must appear identical after a 120° rotation and must also be symmetric with respect to a horizontal plane.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule includes a triphenylene core fused to a trifuran system with ketone groups. While triphenylene itself has a three-fold rotational symmetry, the addition of the trifuran and ketone groups may disrupt the symmetry. The complex substitution pattern suggests that the molecule may not retain **C₃h** symmetry.

2. **Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule features a benzo ring fused to a trifuran system with ketone groups. The substitution pattern does not appear to be symmetric enough to support a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it likely does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

3. **Option C: triisopropyl borate**  
   Triisopropyl borate, (i-Pr)₃BO, has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically. This structure has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σᵢ), making it a clear example of **C₃h** symmetry.

4. **Option D: quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. Its symmetry is dominated by a two-fold rotation axis, and it does not possess a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not exhibit **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that satisfies the **C₃h** symmetry requirements. 

Answer: C
