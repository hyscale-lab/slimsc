Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, you form acetate ions. The question has two parts: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence point. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through each step.

First, the initial situation. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. But wait, the dilution happens before the titration starts. So the initial concentration after dilution is important because that will determine the equivalence point calculation.

Let me calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are volume (in liters) times molarity. So, 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got that.

Now, during titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from initial 20 cm³). So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 as well. Since NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume is moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence. So,
