Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem gives me a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, these states are orthonormal, so their inner products are either 0 or 1. 

The first task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij. The rule is that A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. So, for a 2x2 matrix, it looks like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, because for i≠j, it's hbar/2. So for the first row, j=2 is different from i=1, so A12 = hbar/2. Similarly, A21 = hbar/2. The diagonals are zero.

Hmm, but wait, the question mentions the eigenstates of this operator. So the |alpha> state is given in the z-basis (|up> and |down>), but the operator's eigenstates are different. Oh right, because if I have a different operator, its eigenstates form a different basis. So I need to find the eigenstates of matrix A, and then find the probabilities of |alpha> being in each of those eigenstates.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I can diagonalize the operator A and express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates. Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in the state vector.

So the steps I think are:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>. Because it's proportional to (1+i)|up>+(2-i)|down>, it's not normalized yet. So I need to find the normalization factor.

2. Find the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

3. Express the normalized |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates. The coefficients will give me the probabilities when squared.

4. Then, calculate the average value (expectation value) of the operator A in the |alpha> state.

Let me start with step 1: Normalizing |alpha>.

The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2).

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So sum is 2+5=7. So normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now step 2: Find the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is the matrix [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], it's a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) =0.

The matrix A is:

[0     hbar/2
hbar/2 0 ]

So the characteristic equation is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = 0.

That's λ^2 - (hbar^2/4) = 0 → λ^2 = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now to find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → [[ -hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, -hbar/2 ] ] v = 0.

So the equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of [1,1]^T. But we can normalize it.

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + λ I) → [[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, hbar/2 ] ].

So the equations are (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 + v2=0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are [1, -1]^T and [1,1]^T, normalized.

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait: the operator A is given as A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], which is equivalent to (hbar/2)(|down><up| + |up><down| ).

Wait, but in terms of spin, the operator S_x is (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up| ), so A is actually 2S_x. Because S_x has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2 as well, since A = 2 S_x.

Wait, wait. Let me compute. S_x is (ħ/2) (|up><down| + |down><up| ). So A = 2 S_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of S_x, which are |+x> and |−x>. 

But perhaps that's not necessary for this problem. Anyway, the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So now, back to the state |alpha>.

We have |alpha> expressed in the z-basis:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

We need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->.

So let me write |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Compute c_+ and c_-.

c_+ is the inner product of |+> and |alpha>.

|+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

c_+ = < + | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

= [1/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ] [ <up| (1+i)|up> + <up| (2 -i)|down> + <down| (1+i)|up> + <down| (2 -i)|down> ]

But <up| down> = 0, so some terms drop out.

= [1/(sqrt(14)) ] [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Since <up|up> = 1, same for down.

So,

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14 )

Simplify numerator: 1 + i + 2 - i = 3 → 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, c_- is the inner product of |-> and |alpha>.

|-> is (|up> - |down> )/sqrt(2).

c_- = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

= [1/(sqrt(14)) ] [ (1+i) <up| up> - (2 -i) <down| down> ]

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14 )

Numerator: 1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14 )

So |alpha> is (3/sqrt(14)) |+> + ( (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) ) |->.

Wait, but wait a second. Because |+> and |-> are orthonormal, the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of c_+ and c_- should be 1.

Compute |c_+|^2 = (3^2)/(14) ) = 9/14 ≈0.6429.

|c_-|^2 = ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 → (1 +4)/(14) →5/14 ≈0.3571.

So 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are |c_+|^2 =9/14 ≈0.6429 and |c_-|^2=5/14≈0.3571.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which are approximately 9/14 and 5/14. So that's matching.

Now, the average value of operator A.

The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is represented in the z-basis, and |alpha> is in that basis, perhaps it's easier to compute.

Alternatively, since A is Hermitian, and knowing that |alpha> is in the z-basis, but the operator is in terms of |up> and |down>, perhaps it's easier to write A in the z-basis and compute.

But wait, operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0 ]].

So matrix A looks like:

0    hbar/2

hbar/2  0

So |alpha> in the z-basis is:

alpha = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So to compute <A>, it's alpha† A alpha.

So let me compute it.

Compute each component:

First, alpha is a column vector:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

[ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So alpha† is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

Multiply alpha† * A: 

First, compute A * alpha:

A * alpha = [ 0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2-i)/sqrt(7) ) ]^T

Which is:

[ (hbar/2)(2 -i) / sqrt(7) ]

[ (hbar/2)(1 +i) / sqrt(7) ]

Then, alpha† * (A * alpha):

= [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7) , (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7),
                                              (hbar/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

= (1 -i)(hbar/2)(2 -i)/(7) + (2 +i)(hbar/2)(1 +i)/(7 )

Factor out (hbar/2)/7:

= (hbar/(14)) [ (1 -i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + i^2*(-1) → 2 -i - 2i + (-1) → 2 -3i -1 → (1 -3i)

Wait wait, no. Let me compute it step by step.

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 - i - 2i + i²
= 2 -3i + (-1) → because i²=-1
= (2-1) -3i → 1 -3i.

Similarly, (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i → 2 + 2i +i + i² → 2 +3i -1 → 1 +3i.

So adding the two terms:

(1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So back to the expression:

(hbar/(14)) * [2 ] = 2 hbar /14 = hbar/7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A says average value is hbar/7. So option A's average is hbar/7, and the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which match the 9/14 and 5/14.

So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the expectation value computation because sometimes signs can be tricky.

Wait, when I computed (1 -i)(2 -i) and (2 +i)(1 +i), I got 1-3i and 1+3i. So adding them gives 2. So the expectation is hbar/(14) * 2 = hbar/7. That looks correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: probabilities 0.64 (≈9/14≈0.6429) and 0.36 (≈5/14≈0.3571), average hbar/7.

So it matches.

Alternatively, let me look at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Yes, that's exactly what I got.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state:

The state is proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
|1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, \quad |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5.
\]

Thus, the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{2 + 5} = 1/\sqrt{7} \). The normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

The state \( | \alpha \rangle \) is expressed in terms of these eigenstates. The coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) are computed as:

\[
c_+ = \langle + | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | + \langle \downarrow | \right) \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle \right),
\]

\[
c_- = \langle - | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \uparrow | - \langle \downarrow | \right) \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Finally, the average value of the operator \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of \( A \) and the components of \( | \alpha \rangle \), we calculate:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar / 7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
