Okay, so I'm looking at this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, so local thermodynamic equilibrium applies. I remember that in LTE, the distribution of atoms in different energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution.

So, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is something like (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Wait, in this case, E2 - E1 is positive because the higher energy level is considered. So if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms, n1 is twice n2. Or wait, wait—no, wait. Let's make sure.

Wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think that means that the population of the higher energy level (n_high) is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for each star, the ratio of n_high to n_low would be given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the ratio of n_high to n_low is exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait no, wait. Wait, the Boltzmann equation is (n2)/(n1) = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T) ). So if E2 is higher than E1, then (n2/n1) is less than 1 if T is positive. So in star_1, n_high is twice n_low (in star_2?), no, wait. Let me read the question again.

Wait, no. The question says that in star_1, the number is twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio is n1_high / n1_low = 2 * (n2_high / n2_low), or something else? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So, for star_1: (n_high)_1 / (n_low)_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly, for star_2: (n_high)_2 / (n_low)_2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So I think that (n_high)_1 / (n_low)_1 = 2 * (n_high)_2 / (n_low)_2.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says that in star_1, the excited atoms are twice as much when compared to star_2. So perhaps (n_high)_1 = 2 * (n_high)_2. No, that doesn't make sense because each star has its own n_high and n_low. Or perhaps it's the ratio n_high/n_low for star_1 is twice that for star_2.

Wait, I think the question is that the ratio (n_high)/(n_low) for star_1 is twice as much as that for star_2. No, wait the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think for the same energy level, the number in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait no, perhaps for the same level, the population is higher in star_1. But I'm not certain. Maybe it's better to approach this with the equation.

Let me denote that for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor.

So for star_1: (n_high1)/(n_low1) = exp(-ΔE/(
