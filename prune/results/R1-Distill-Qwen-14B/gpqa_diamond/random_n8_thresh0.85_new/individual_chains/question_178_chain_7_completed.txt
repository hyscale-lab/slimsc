Okay, so I've got this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, γ matrices are the Dirac matrices.

I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants is important for determining renormalizability. A renormalizable theory is one where the coupling has a mass dimension ≥ 0, I think. Or wait, no, wait. The superficial degree of divergence is related to the mass dimension of the coupling. If the superficial degree of divergence is negative, the theory is renormalizable.

But first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. So let's figure out the dimensions of each part in the Lagrangian.

The Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1), so each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, wait, the Lagrangian density itself has mass dimension 4? Because the action S is dimensionless, and S = ∫ d^4x L, so [L] = [mass]^4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So let's look at L_int: it's κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each field has a certain mass dimension. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2 because ψ has dimension (3 - 1)/2 = 1, wait wait, no. Wait, in four dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (i∂ - m)ψ = 0. So the derivative has dimension 1, m has dimension 1, so ψ must have dimension (1 + 1)/1 = 1 + (from the equation) or wait, perhaps the correct way is considering the action.

Alternatively, the mass dimension of fields is given by their scaling. Fields in the Lagrangian must have dimensions such that each term is dimension 4.

So, for ψ, let me think: the kinetic term in the Dirac Lagrangian is i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. Each ψ has dimension (4 -1)/2 = 3/2? Because the term [ψ][ψ][∂μ ψ] must be dimension 4.

Wait, the term i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ: ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. ∂_μ has dimension 1. So each ψ is 3/2, and the product of two ψs and a ∂ would be 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = 4. So yes, ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. For a gauge field A_mu, the field tensor F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. So each A has dimension 1, because ∂ has dimension 1, and F has dimension 2.

Wait, checking: the Maxwell Lagrangian is F^2, so [F]^2 must be 4. So [F] is 2, because (2)*2 =4. So F has dimension 2.

So, putting it all together: the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me compute each part's dimension.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ same, so ψ̄ ψ has dimension 3. Then σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices and their commutator, but since it's just a tensor of gamma matrices, it's dimensionless. Because the gamma matrices are treated as dimensionless objects.

Wait, no, the sigma_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so it doesn't contribute to the mass dimension. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

So ψ̄ σ ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is 3.

Then F^{μν} has dimension 2.

So the entire term is (κ) * (ψ̄ σ ψ F) → [κ] × (3 + 2) = [κ] × 5. Because 3 from ψ̄ ψ and 2 from F.

But the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so:

[κ] × 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4/5. Wait, that can't be right. Because 4/5 is not an integer, but the options given are -1, 1, etc. Hmm, maybe I messed up the dimensions.

Wait, wait. Let me re-express everything.

Breaking down L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. Then F^{μν} is dimension 2. So the product is 3 + 2 = 5.

So the term is κ multiplied by 5. The entire term must have dimension 4, so:

[κ] + 5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

Ah, that makes sense. So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, for renormalizability. Remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension or zero. Because, in general, if a coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction becomes weaker at long distances (i.e., high mass scales), which implies the theory is non-renormalizable and requires an infinite number of counterterms, leading to non-predictive theory.

Wait, wait, no, actually, the other way around. A coupling with positive mass dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at lower energies, which is renormalizable. Because the dimension of the coupling is [κ] = -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So, the mass dimension of κ is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, that's option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of fields
- The Dirac spinor \( \psi \) has a mass dimension of \( \frac{3}{2} \), as it appears in the kinetic term \( i \bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi \), which must have mass dimension 4.
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of 2, as it is derived from the gauge field \( A_\mu \) with dimension 1.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The term \( \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi \) has a mass dimension of \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 \), since \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is dimensionless (being a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices). Multiplying by \( F^{\mu\nu} \), which has dimension 2, gives a total dimension of \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) for the interaction term. The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4, so:

\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since \( [\kappa] = -1 \), which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms and are generally not predictive at all energy scales.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to option C.
