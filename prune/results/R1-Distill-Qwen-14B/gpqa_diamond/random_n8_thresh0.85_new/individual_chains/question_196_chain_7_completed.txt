Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed, but this is relativistic, so things must be different. Let me think.

So the question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is maximum amplitude A and it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The mass is m, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is a relativistic case, so that can't be the right answer.

But wait, relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of c. So the energy can't be treated classically. So I need to use relativistic mechanics here.

In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But here, the oscillator's potential energy and kinetic energy would also need to be considered in a relativistic framework.

Wait, the system is a harmonic oscillator. So it's oscillating between potential and kinetic energy. But in relativity, the relationship between energy and momentum is different. So maybe I should model the energy at the point of maximum displacement (A) where all the energy is potential, and at the equilibrium position (x=0) where all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². It's (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all energy is potential. When it's at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So the total energy should be conserved between these two points.

Wait, but the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But wait, if it's relativistic, does the potential energy expression change? Hmm, I'm not sure. The problem states it obeys Hooke's law, so maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kA² as before.

So, the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no. In the rest frame, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So when the oscillator is at x=A, all the energy is in the potential. When it's moving through x=0, all the energy is in the kinetic energy, which would be (γ-1)mc². So the total energy is E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Or is E the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy?

Wait, maybe E is the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the potential energy. So when the oscillator is at x=A, the total energy is mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy at x=0. But in the relativistic case, the total energy would be more than mc² because the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is E_kin = (γ-1)mc². But what's the potential energy at x=0? It should be zero, because F = -kx, so U = (1/2)kx², which is zero at x=0.

Wait, so the total energy at x=A is the potential energy plus the rest energy? No, because in relativity, the rest energy is always present. Hmm, perhaps I should model it as the total energy being the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So, E = γ mc².

Wait, that makes sense. So, E at x=A is mc² + (1/2)kA². At x=0, E is γ mc². So:

γ mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²

Divide both sides by mc²:

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²)

Hmm, because (1/2)kA² is (kA²)/(2), and when divided by mc², it becomes kA²/(2 m c²).

So γ = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²)

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Let me rearrange this. Let me denote the term (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable, say, α. So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + α

So, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + α)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2

Then, v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 

So, v_max = c * sqrt[ 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 ]

But α is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So substituting back:

v_max = c * sqrt[ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ]

Which can be rewritten as:

v_max = c * sqrt[ ( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 - 1 ) / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ) ]

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's compute 1/(1 + α)^2. So:

1/(1 + α)^2 = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 )

So the expression under the square root becomes:

1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2 ]

Let me factor that as:

[ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) - 1 ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute the numerator:

1 - [1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ] = [ (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 - 1 ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2 (k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))²) -1 = 2 (k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² 

Simplify:

= (k A²/(m c²)) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4)

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is leading me any closer. Let me go back to the expression for v_max.

The expression I have is:

v_max = c * sqrt[ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 ]

Looking at the options given, let's see which one matches.

Option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So option D is the correct one. 

Wait, but let me double-check. So I assumed that the total energy at x=A is the rest energy plus the potential energy. At x=0, the total energy is just the kinetic energy (since potential is zero there). So E = mc² + (1/2)k A² = γ mc².

Solving for γ gives the equation I used. So that seems correct.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we must account for relativistic effects. In the relativistic regime, the total energy \( E \) of the system is conserved and includes both rest energy and kinetic energy.

At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), all the energy is potential energy, given by \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). The total energy at this point is therefore:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic energy, which in relativistic terms is:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]

Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we find:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- Option A and B involve incorrect forms of the denominator.
- Option C is the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
