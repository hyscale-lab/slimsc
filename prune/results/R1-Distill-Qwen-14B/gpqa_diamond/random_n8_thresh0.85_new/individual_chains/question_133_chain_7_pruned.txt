Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The options are A to D, each a different concentration.

Wait, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- right? So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution. Hmm. Both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are phosphoric acid salts. I remember that these salts can dissociate in water, and their behavior depends on the pH. So I think I should consider the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or maybe look into the different equilibria.

Let me think about each salt. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is KH2PO4, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion). So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Now, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The three dissociation steps have the given Ka values. The first is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- with Ka1 = 7.5e-3. The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- with Ka2 = 6.2e-8. The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution from the two salts, the solution is probably a buffer solution involving these two species. Buffers resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. In this case, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because those are the species present.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a buffer to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and acid. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, in this case, HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-. So the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So the relevant pKa here is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. Let me calculate pKa2: pKa = -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that. Log(6.2) is about 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) is approx 7.208. So pKa2 is around 7.208.

Wait, but wait. The solution is made from KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will determine the pH. But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. But since Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2, the concentration of PO4^3- is probably much lower than HPO4^2-.

Hmm, but why? Because in the solution, if the pH is around 7.2, which is higher than the pKa2 (since pKa2 is about 7.2), the concentration of HPO4^2- is higher than H2PO4^-? Wait, no, let me think. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation says pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). So if the pH is around pKa2, the ratio is 1. If the pH is higher than pKa2, the base (HPO4^2-) is favored, so [HPO4^2-] > [H2PO4^-].

So the solution's pH is around 7.2, which is the pKa2, so the two concentrations are about equal? Wait, let me think again. If the pH is equal to pKa2, then [HPO4^2-] equals [H2PO4^-], so the ratio is 1. So in that case, the solution would be a buffer with equal concentrations of both.

But wait, in this case, the solution is made by mixing 1g of KH2PO4 and 1g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. Are the moles of each approximately the same? Let me calculate the moles.

First, the molecular weights (Mw) are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O.

For KH2PO4: moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Wait, 136.09 g/mol is about 0.0734 moles per gram? Wait, no, wait: 1g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Similarly, for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, so the moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 are 0.00734 mol, and the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O are 0.00561 mol.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.00561 / 0.00734 ≈ 0.764.

Wait, but according to the Henderson equation, pH = pKa2 + log(0.764) ≈ 7.208 + (-0.115) ≈ 7.093.

So the pH of the solution is about 7.09. Which is slightly below pKa2 (7.208), meaning that the concentration of H2PO4^- is higher than HPO4^2-.

Wait, but why? Because the ratio is less than one. If the ratio of base to acid is less than one, the log is negative, so the pH is lower than pKa2. So in this case, the solution is on the acid side of the buffer, so H2PO4^- is the major species.

But wait, the problem is about orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-: HPO4^2- ⇌ PO4^3- + H+. The equilibrium for this is governed by Ka3, which is 1.8e-12.

So the concentration of PO4^3- would depend on the pH and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

So first, I need to find the pH of the solution, which is approximately what I just did (around 7.09), and then use that to find [PO4^3-].

Wait, but to find [PO4^3-], I can use the Ka3 expression.

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^
