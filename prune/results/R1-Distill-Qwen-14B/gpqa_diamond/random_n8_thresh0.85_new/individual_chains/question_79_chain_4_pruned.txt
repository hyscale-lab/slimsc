Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what Compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm. Wait a second, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? I think it's commonly used as a catalyst in certain reactions, maybe eliminations or ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, wait! Diazabicyclo compounds are often used in the Hofmann elimination reaction, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that it's used in the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides, but wait, no, that's usually done with something like an acid or a different base.

Wait, wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide? Oh, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation reaction leading to elimination. Oh, but in the problem statement, the product's NMR is given, so maybe the reaction is the opening of an epoxide.

Wait, let me think. The product's NMR has certain signals. Let me look at the 1H NMR. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, looking at these, I see two singlets around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each integrating for 3H. These might be two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signal, like a carbonyl or an aromatic ring. Wait, but in the 13C NMR, I see a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl carbon. That's probably a ketone or an ester or something similar. Hmm, but from the 1H NMR, the two singlets at ~2.3 are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split them. Like if they're attached to a carbonyl, perhaps?

Wait, but in the 13C NMR, the carbons are:

21.3 (s) – maybe a CH3 attached to something that doesn't split it, like a carbonyl.

28.4 (s) – another CH3, perhaps attached to a different group, maybe an aromatic ring.

126.9, 127.1, 129.1, 130.3 – all these are around aromatic carbons. So the molecule has a benzene ring or maybe a styryl group.

141.5 and 144.1 – these are probably carbons attached to substituents, maybe as part of a double bond or an oxygen-containing group.

197.7 – that's a carbonyl carbon, likely a ketone.

Wait, but the starting material is being reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh! I remember that when epoxides react under certain conditions, they can open up. Wait, but in what conditions? Epoxides can open with acids or bases. Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps it's deprotonating something adjacent to an epoxide, leading to ring opening via an elimination.

Wait, so if X is an epoxide, and the reaction opens it up, perhaps the product is an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the base induces an elimination, leading to formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the starting material had an epoxide and, upon treatment with a strong base, underwent elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the product. The 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. Let's see: 2.28 and 2.31, each 3H. So perhaps two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl? Wait, but that would be geminal di-methyl groups on a carbonyl, which is impossible because a carbonyl can't have two methyl groups attached to the same carbon. So maybe each methyl is attached to something else, like two separate carbonyls. But wait, looking at the 13C, only one carbonyl at 197.7. So that's probably a single carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe those two methyl
