Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about why a transgenic mouse model isn't expressing the protein as expected. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They've introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells, but the protein isn't overexpressing. They found that the plus strand sequence of their construct has a particular sequence, and they noticed the problem.

Looking at the options, the possible reasons are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Wait, so the HA tag is introduced. If it's a missense, maybe it's not expressed. But the question is about overexpression, not detection. Also, if the HA sequence is wrong, the affinity purification might not work. But why would that prevent expression? Maybe the mutation is in the HA tag, causing it not to be recognized, but the construct's overall expression isn't prevented. The problem here is more about expression levels, not detection.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If the mRNA has a stop codon early on, the protein would be truncated. Looking at the sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons. Let me look for TAA, TAG, or TGA triplets.

Looking at the given sequence:

5'ATG... (the start codon is ATG). Let's look through the sequence.

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA. Let me go through:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, near the end, I see TGA at the very end. Let me see:

...CGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Here, the last part is GAGTGA. So TGA is the stop codon. But wait, the sequence is written as the plus strand, which is the same as the mRNA. So the mRNA would be complementary to the plus strand. Wait, wait, no—the plus strand is the same as the mRNA (except T for U). So in the plus strand, the stop codon is TGA, so in the mRNA it's UGA, which is a stop codon.

So where is this TGA located? Let me count the letters. The last part is ...GTGA. Oh wait, the last part is:

...CGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

So the last few codons would be CGA GTG GCC ... and then the stop is TGA. So the construct ends with TGA as the stop codon. So the mRNA would have UGA at the end.

But wait, the coding sequence is for the HA tag followed by GADD45G. If the stop codon is at the very end, that should be fine. Ribosomes would terminate after the correct full-length protein. So why isn't the protein expressed?

Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain. So if there's no linker between the HA tag and the GADD45G, maybe the proteases are cutting it. But why would that prevent expression? The protein would be produced but maybe degraded. So the expression level would be low because the protein is not stable. That could explain why they can't overexpress it. So this is a possibility.

Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse. Hmm. If the mRNA has a UAA codon, but mouse cells don't have a tRNA for it, that would cause a problem. Wait, but UAA is a stop codon. Stop codons don't get translated because there are no tRNAs for them. So the presence of a stop codon should terminate translation. So in the construct, if the sequence has a stop codon within the coding sequence, that would cause premature termination. Looking back, the sequence's last part is TGA, which is a stop codon. So in their construct, the protein would be truncated. But wait, the construct is designed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus followed by GADD45G. So if the stop codon is at the very end, it shouldn't cause early termination. Unless there's another stop codon earlier.

Wait, looking back through the sequence for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA before the end. Let me scan for any 'TGA' earlier.

Going through the sequence, let's see:

Looking for any TGA triplets.

Looking at the start: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT Gtt cca gat tac gcc aat...

Wait, the mRNA is the same as the plus strand. So the first codon is ATG (start). Then TAC is Tyr. Then CCA is Pro. TAC is Tyr, GAT is Asp, etc.

Looking for any TGA in the middle. Let's look for the letters T-G-A in sequence.

Looking through:

...ATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, does the sequence have any TGA before the last part?

Looking at the middle, I see 'TGAACGTGGACCCCGAC...'

Wait, TGA is part of TGAAC... So the triplet is T-G-A. So in that spot, TGA is present. So from position: ...TGAACGTGGAC...

So the codon there is TGA followed by ACG. So TGA is a stop codon. So that's in the middle of the construct. Oh, that's a problem.

So the construct has a stop codon in the middle, which would cause the ribosome to terminate early, leading to a truncated protein. So the HA tag might be expressed, but the GADD45G would not. So the protein would be HA-tagged but without the rest, making it non-functional and perhaps not detected, but the question is why overexpression isn't happening.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct would be HA followed by GADD45G. If there's a stop codon in the middle, after the HA, the ribosome would stop there, so the HA is expressed, but the rest isn't. So the HA would be expressed as a small peptide, but the GADD45G wouldn't be. So the expression level of the full-length protein would be low, which is what the problem is.

So the issue is that there's an early stop codon in the construct, causing premature termination. So the correct option would be B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Looking at the options, option B says that the ribosome terminated early. So that would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed.

Wait, but earlier I thought the problem could be C (proteolysis). But in that case, the protein would be made but quickly degraded. So the cells would show lower levels because the protein isn't stable. But in the question, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected—so perhaps not enough is being made in the first place.

But in this case, the construct has an internal stop codon, so the protein isn't even made to full length. So the expression level would be low because the mRNA is being translated only up to that point. So the plasmid's construct is faulty, leading to a truncated protein that doesn't function.

So the issue is the presence of the stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, which is causing the ribosome to terminate early. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but why is the stop codon present? Maybe during cloning, the HA tag wasn't correctly added, and a stop codon was introduced. Let me check the original construct. The HA is added at the N-terminus. So the construct should be HA followed by GADD45G. If during cloning, they introduced a TGA in the coding sequence, that would cause this problem.

So the sequence shows that after the HA, there's a TGA. So the HA is at the beginning, then the next codon is stop. So the HA would be expressed, but nothing else. Hence, the full-length protein isn't made, leading to no overexpression.

So the correct answer is B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model is not overexpressing the GADD45G protein. The construct includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus, and the issue lies in the sequence of the plus strand of the construct. Upon analyzing the sequence, the key observation is the presence of an in-frame stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in the production of a truncated protein (HA tag only) instead of the full-length GADD45G protein. This explains why the protein is not being overexpressed as expected.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **Option A:** A missense mutation in the HA tag sequence would affect detection or functionality but would not prevent the expression of the full-length protein. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
- **Option B:** The presence of an in-frame stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein. This aligns with the observed issue of failed overexpression.
- **Option C:** Proteolysis of the nascent chain could degrade the protein, but the question specifically focuses on the inability to overexpress the protein, which points to a problem in translation rather than post-translational degradation.
- **Option D:** The absence of a tRNA for the UAA codon is irrelevant here because UAA is not present in the sequence. The issue is caused by the TGA stop codon, which is a valid stop codon recognized by the translation machinery.

The correct explanation is that the premature stop codon in the construct causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed.

**Answer: B**
