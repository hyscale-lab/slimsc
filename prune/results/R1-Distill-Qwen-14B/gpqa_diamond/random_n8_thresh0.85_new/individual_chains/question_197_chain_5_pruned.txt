Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. Let's take a deep breath and tackle this step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of an acid anhydride or maybe an ester? Wait, no, wait. Oh right, when you have a nitrile group, treating it with red phosphorus and HI can lead to the formation of a primary amine. Or wait, is it something else? Or maybe it's for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine. Alternatively, another reaction I'm thinking about is the formation of an imidate or something else. Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible functional groups in Compound X first.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, likely due to an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, probably a carboxylic acid (they usually show around 1700 cm-1, but can be higher). Then, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might indicate aromatic C=C stretching. So, there's probably a benzene ring involved. So putting this together, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think about that.
