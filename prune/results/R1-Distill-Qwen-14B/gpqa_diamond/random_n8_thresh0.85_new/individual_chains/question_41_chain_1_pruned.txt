Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects the way light propagates through it. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details.

The question says a light beam is in glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The observer is in the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass. They're asking what the speed of light in the glass is, relative to the lab.

Wait a second, speed of light in a medium. Normally, when the medium is stationary relative to the observer, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So normally, v_medium = c/n.

But now the medium is moving. Oh right, there's this thing about relativity here. Or maybe it's more about how the velocity adds up. Because in classical mechanics, velocities just add vectorially, but when it comes to light and high speeds, we can't use that.

Wait, but in this case, the speed of light in the medium is v_medium = c/n. And the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, no. Because in the frame where the medium is moving, the light's speed isn't just the sum. Because in special relativity, velocities don't add like that. Oh but wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame
