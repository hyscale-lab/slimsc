Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to process all the information given.

First, the molecular formula of the compound is C8H9NO. That's a bit tricky, but I can think about possible structures. The NMR data is provided, so that should help a lot in determining the structure.

Looking at the 1H-NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H): That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. But wait, an aldehyde is at the end; maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group?

- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H): These could be aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted benzene rings since the doublet suggests coupling with one neighbor. If two aromatic protons in a doublet, perhaps each is adjacent to a substituent.

- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons. Maybe they're on another aromatic ring, perhaps in the meta position relative to substituents?

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me think again. Oh wait, the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene would typically be a singlet if there are two substituents. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted ring. Alternatively, perhaps the two sets of doublets are from two different aromatic rings. Like if there are two benzene rings, each with substituents, such that each ring's protons are split into doublets.

Then, 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H): A broad signal often indicates exchange with a proton, like an -OH group. But wait, it's two protons. Maybe they're adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diol or something else. Or perhaps these are vinylic protons. Wait, but the 'bs' stands for broad singlet. So maybe they are part of an enol structure, or maybe they're on an aromatic ring that's conjugated with something else. Or maybe they're in a di-substituted position, but I'm not certain.

Next, 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H): This is around the range for CH2 groups adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group, like in an ether or an alkoxy group. The doublet suggests coupling with another CH2 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm as a triplet. So maybe the structure is an aromatic aldehyde with some substituents.

Wait, the aldehyde is a triplet. So the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a CH2 group. Let's imagine that. The aldehyde is CH2-CHO. But that would make the aldehyde proton a triplet, as each CH2 proton would split it into a triplet. So if the structure has a CH2CHO group, the aldehyde proton would be a triplet.

So the molecule might have a CH2CHO group connected to something else. Let's think about the other groups.

The 6.98 and 6.51 doublets could be from two benzene rings. Maybe each has two substituents. For example, maybe each ring has a substituent at the para position, leading to two doublets each with 2H. Alternatively, perhaps each ring is para-substituted, but each has different substituents.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, two benzene rings (each contributes 4, but wait, benzene is 3 each? Wait, each ring is 4? No, wait, each benzene ring is 3 double bonds (or one ring with three double bonds), so each benzene gives 4 degrees of unsaturation: one ring (1) plus three double bonds (3), total 4. Hmm, no wait, no, each ring is one degree, each double bond is another. So a benzene ring has three double bonds and one ring: 4 degrees. So two benzene rings would be 8 degrees, but wait our total is 5. So that can't be. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, let's recalculate: (2*8 + 2 -9 + 1 (since N=1, but I think the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2?), so N is considered as +1. So 2*8=16, plus 2 is 18. Minus 9 is 9. Plus 1 (N) is 10. Divided by 2 is 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation.

So 5 can be, for example, one benzene ring (4) and one double bond (1), or another possibility. Let's think about possible structures.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a benzaldehyde group, a CH2CHO, and some other substituents. Let me think. So if there's a benzaldehyde (PhCHO), that's 7 carbons (Ph is 6, CHO is 1). Then, perhaps the remaining would be a CH2 group connected to another aromatic ring? Or perhaps an OCH2 group.

Wait, looking at the NMR, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. So maybe that's an OCH2 group. Maybe the structure is something like PhCHO-CH2-O-R, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: Looking at the reagents the compound is being reacted with. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

That sequence looks familiar. NaNO2 and HCl are typically used for diazotization, which is often part of a Sandmeyer reaction or something similar. But after that, H2O and then aqueous KOH with heatâ€”what does that do?

Wait, another thought. Diazonium salt formation. When an aromatic amine is treated with nitrous acid (HNO2) in HCl, it forms a diazonium chloride. Then, when heated with water, it might undergo hydrolysis. But wait, let me think. If you have a benzene ring with a substituent that can form a diazonium salt, like an aromatic amine or a hydroxylamine group, then upon diazotization, it forms the diazonium salt. Then, when treated with H2O (like a hydrolysis), perhaps it forms a phenol.

Wait, but the initial compound's NMR has an aldehyde group. So maybe the starting material has both an aldehyde and an aromatic amine? Or maybe after reaction, the amino group is converted.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an aniline derivative with an aldehyde group. Let me think.

Wait, the NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72 ppm triplet). So the starting compound has an aldehyde group. Then, the reaction steps would affect that.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to construct the structure from the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 is probably the aldehyde proton. The triplet suggests it's adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure is RCH2CHO. The CH2 group would have two protons, so the triplet in the aldehyde comes from coupling with the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

Looking at the NMR, the CH2 is at 3.66 ppm as a doublet. So the adjacent group to CH2 is probably an oxygen, like OCH2. So maybe the structure is OCH2CH2CHO, but that's just a guess.

Wait, but the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. So it's adjacent to a CH2 which is adjacent to another group. For example, maybe it's part of a chain like CH2-O-R, where R is something else.

Now, the aromatic signals: 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H). That seems like two sets of aromatic protons. Maybe each is a para-substituted benzene ring, but with substituents that cause the doublets.

Wait, another thought. If the compound has two benzene rings, each para-substituted, but perhaps each has a substituent that causes the adjacent protons to be in a doublet. For example, substituents in the para position would give each aromatic ring's protons as a doublet, each with two protons.

Alternatively, perhaps each aromatic ring has substituents in such a way that each set of protons is a doublet. Hmm.

Wait, then there's the 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H). Could this be an enol proton? Or perhaps two protons that are part of an aromatic ring with substituents leading to a broad signal. Another possibility is that these are protons next to an oxygen, like in a diol or a hemiacetal, but I'm not sure.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is something like this: a central chain with an aldehyde group, connected to a CH2O group, which in turn connects to two aromatic rings. But I'm not entirely clear. Let me try to imagine the structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: Each benzene ring is 6 carbons, but perhaps the molecule has only one benzene ring? Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with other substituents.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. The NMR shows an aldehyde, two sets of aromatic protons (each 2H), a CH2 group, and a 2H broad singlet.

Hmm. Another possibility is that the molecule is a diphenyl compound with some substituents. For example, diphenylacetaldehyde or similar.

Wait, maybe the molecule is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with some substituents. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the reaction steps.

The reagents are: first nitrous acid (NaNO2, HCl), then H2O, then KOH aqueous and heat.

Wait, another approach: The first step is diazotization. That requires an aromatic amine. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group. But earlier, the NMR indicated an aldehyde. So, perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic amine and an aldehyde group. Then, in the reaction, the amine group is converted into a diazonium salt, which then undergoes some reaction.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aldehyde is present. So if the starting material has an aromatic amine and an aldehyde, after the first step, the amine is converted to a diazonium salt.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the reaction steps.

1. NaNO2 and HCl: This forms a diazonium salt from an aromatic amine.

2. H2O: Maybe hydrolysis. If the diazonium salt is subjected to hydrolysis, it can form a phenol. So if the starting aromatic amine was in a certain position, the phenol would be formed after hydrolysis.

3. Aqueous KOH and heat: This might induce some elimination or condensation reaction. Maybe a dehydration or aldol condensation?

Wait, but in the NMR data, the starting compound has an aldehyde. So perhaps the starting compound is an aromatic aldehyde with an amino group. Let's think of that.

Wait, but if the starting compound is an aldehyde with an amino group, perhaps in the para position on the benzene ring. So it would be p-aminobenzaldehyde.

But let's see: p-aminobenzaldehyde has the structure Ph-NH2-CHO. Wait, no, that's not correct. It would be benzene with an amino group and an aldehyde group in the para positions. So the structure would be OHC-C6H4-NH2.

But that's 1,4-benzendiamine? No, it's 4-aminobenzaldehyde. Molecular formula for that would be C7H5NO. But the given formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps the starting compound has more carbons.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the starting compound is something like diphenylcarbinol. No, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an amino group attached. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting compound is a benzylamine derivative with an aldehyde group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the starting structure is a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached. Let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO.

So C8H9NO. Let me calculate the possible structure. Let's suppose it's a benzene ring with two substituents: an aldehyde group and an amino group. Benzene (6 C) + CHO (1 C) + NH2 (1 N, but no C). So that's 7 C, but we have 8 C. So perhaps another carbon somewhere. Maybe a methyl group attached. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with an ethoxy group attached. Let me think: C6H5-CHO wouldn't add up correctly, but with an ethoxy group, maybe.

Wait, maybe I should try to focus on the reaction steps. The first step is diazotization, which requires an amine. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine.

So, the starting compound has an aromatic amine (so -NH2 group) and other groups, including an aldehyde.

So the structure could be something like p-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure would be CH3CH(OH)NH2 attached to benzene? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with an amino group and a CH2CHO group.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure as:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that would be a butyl group with aldehyde. But I'm not sure about the substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with an amino group attached. But I'm getting stuck.

Another approach: Let's think about the starting compound's structure. The NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72 ppm, triplet), a CH2 group (3.66, doublet), and two sets of aromatic protons (6.98 and 6.51, each doublets). Plus, the 6.27 (broad, 2H), which could be an -OH or another type of proton.

Wait, perhaps the 6.27 is an enol proton. If there's an enol form, perhaps the molecule has a carbonyl group adjacent to a CH2 group. Or maybe it's a diol.

Alternatively, maybe the 6.27 is part of a conjugated system, like an enol ether or something.

But perhaps I should try to sketch a possible structure. Let's see:

The aldehyde is at 9.72, triplet. So it's adjacent to a CH2 group (since the coupling is with two protons). The CH2 is at 3.66 ppm, doublet. So that CH2 is adjacent to another group, perhaps an oxygen. So maybe the structure is OCH2-CH2-CHO.

But where do the aromatic protons come in?

Wait, perhaps the molecule is diphenyl something. Let's see: if the structure is Ph-O-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with an OCH2CH2CHO group. Hmm, but I'm not making progress.

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with some substituents. The 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde's NMR would show a broad peak for the -OH proton, but in our data, that's not present. Instead, we have a broad singlet for 2H at 6.27, which is a bit confusing.

Another thought: The 6.27 (2H, broad) could be the protons adjacent to an oxygen in an enol form. For example, in a diketone or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is a di-substituted benzaldehyde with a CH2CHO group and a substituent that causes the aromatic protons to split into doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a benzene ring with substituents that lead to the two doublets in the aromatic region. For example, if the benzene has two substituents, each in the para positions, that would split the protons into doublets.

Wait, let's think about the aldehyde. If the structure is something like Ph-CHO, but with more substituents. But the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the structure must have 8 carbons. So benzene (6 C) plus the aldehyde (1 C) and another carbon from where? Maybe an oxygen and another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-CHO attached to a benzene ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings. Wait, that would require 12 carbons, which is more than 8. So probably not.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a substituted benzyl group with an aldehyde. Let me try:

If the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, that's 6 (Ph) + 3 (CH2CH2CHO) = 9 C. But the formula is C8. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2CHO. That's 6 (Ph) + 3 (CH2CHO) = 9 C. Still not matching. Alternatively, Ph-CH2-O-CHO? No, that's too much.

Hmm, perhaps the structure has a ring and a chain.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me try to calculate the possible structure.

Possible functional groups: aldehyde, aromatic rings, perhaps an amine.

So, if the molecule is p-nitrobenzaldehyde, C7H5NO3, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring with an amino group and a substituent that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's something like 4-aminobenzaldehyde. The formula for that is C7H5NO. But our compound has C8H9NO. So perhaps there's an extra CH2 group attached.

Alternatively, maybe it's 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. Structure would be CH3CH2CHO attached to the benzene ring with an amino group in the para position. But that would be C9H11N O, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is a secondary amine. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an amino group and an aldehyde group connected via a carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like Ph-CHOH-CH2-CHO. But that may not fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, with an amino group and a chain leading to an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. That would give a primary amine, but I'm not sure about the structure.

But I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should consider the reaction steps again.

The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl â†’ forms a diazonium chloride from an aromatic amine.
2. H2O â†’ hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.
3. Aqueous KOH and heat â†’ perhaps a condensation reaction, like a Cannizzaro reaction or some kind of elimination.

Wait, but the starting compound has an aldehyde group. So if the aldehyde is present, perhaps in the first step, the amine is converted to a diazonium salt, which upon hydrolysis becomes a phenol. Then, in the presence of KOH and heat, maybe the aldehyde undergoes some reaction, like a Cannizzaro reaction (if it's an aldehyde without alpha hydrogens
