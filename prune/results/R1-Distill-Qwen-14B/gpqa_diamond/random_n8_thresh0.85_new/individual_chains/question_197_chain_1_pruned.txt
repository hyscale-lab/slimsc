Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully. The problem involves a compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, which usually breaks alkenes or alkynes into smaller fragments. So, the first thing I need to determine is what type of compound X is, especially focusing on its unsaturated bonds because that's where the reaction would occur.

The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me look at the IR first. The peaks in the IR are 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region. That might indicate either an O-H stretch or an N-H stretch, but since the options don't have amines, probably O-H. Then there's 1720 cm-1, which is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) group, like a ketone or an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions could correspond to aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting this together, compound X likely has both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, maybe an aromatic ketone, and possibly an O-H group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The peaks are:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which usually suggests an acidic proton, like an O-H in a carboxylic acid or an enol. But considering the IR, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak which might fit a carboxylic acid (but wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H around 10-12 ppm, so that makes sense). Alternatively, it could be an aromatic -OH, but those are usually around 5 ppm but can sometimes be downfield if de-shielded.

Wait, but wait, the 1720 cm-1 in IR for a carboxylic acid? No, actually, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500–3300 cm-1, which is in the given IR data. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak which could be a carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is typically around 1700 cm-1, which matches. The broad peak at 10.5 ppm would then be the O-H of the carboxylic acid.

Looking further at the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests a para-dichlorobenzene or para-disubstituted benzene. Since the substituents could be a carbonyl group (like in benzoic acid) or something else.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative group. Could be a CH between two carbonyl groups, but not sure yet.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps part of a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with three protons, which suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or another carbon. Wait, a doublet for a methyl group would imply it's next to a CH with two protons, like in an isopropyl group. Alternatively, maybe a geminal coupling, but more likely it's attached to a CH2 or similar.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, three hydrogens, likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like an ethyl group (CH2CH3).

Putting this together, the aromatic ring is para-substituted. Let's think about the substituents. There's a carbonyl group (from IR), and perhaps a side chain attached to the ring.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, which is a bit unusual for a carboxylic acid because the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak, but it can be a singlet if there's no splitting. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and are split based on adjacent protons. But in this case, it's a singlet, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

So, if the aromatic ring is para-substituted, one substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the other substituent might be a side chain with a carbonyl group or perhaps an ethyl group.

Wait, but the IR also shows 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the regions for aromatic C=C. If the ring is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups, the C=C peaks would shift. So that's consistent with a para-substituted ring.

Now, considering the NMR signals for the non-aromatic protons:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could suggest a CH adjacent to an oxygen or another electronegative atom. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to that CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group, possibly attached to the CH (like in an isopropyl group). The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, which would be part of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent on the ring is a propyl group, but wait, let's think:

Wait, the substituent on the ring could be a propionyl group (like CH2CH2COOH?), but the structure of the substituent isn't clear. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group with a methyl branch. Let me try to reconstruct.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is a typical terminal methyl group. The next would be a CH2 connected to it, which would be a triplet as well, but in the NMR, the CH2 isn't directly shown unless it's split. Looking at the given data, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to another CH, which is at 2.9 ppm (1H). So perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Or maybe CH2CH(CH2CH3) something.

Wait, let me try to outline the structure. The aromatic ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the other substituent is a side chain. The side chain might be a propyl group with a branch. Let me think about the NMR data.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is then connected to another group. Since 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, that could be a CH2 group next to the CH. So maybe the substituent is an isopropyl group, but wait, an isopropyl group would have a central CH connected to two CH3 groups. But in the NMR, I don't see a triplet for that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, let me think. The substituent on the ring is a group with a CH2-CH-CH2-CH3 structure? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)COOH? Hmm.

Wait, the substituent might be a propyl group, but with a branch. Let me think about the integration: 1H at 2.9, 2H at 1.7, 3H at 1.4, 3H at 0.9. So that's a total of 1+2+3+3=
