Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acid solutions are mixed with a base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Wait, the question is about enthalpy of neutralization, which I remember is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, this is a more complicated case with different solutions mixing.

So the problem gives three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait a minute, wait. Wait, no, actually, let me read the question again. Oh, I see, it's mixing all three together. Oh wait, no, wait, no. Wait, no, the question says when these are mixed, so maybe I need to figure out which acids and bases are reacting.

Wait, let's get the exact question. It says, "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4 and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed." So mixing all three together. Hmm.

Wait, but that might not be correct because HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So mixing acids and a base would lead to a neutralization reaction. But wait, I'm not sure if all of them will react. Hmm.

Wait, I should probably
