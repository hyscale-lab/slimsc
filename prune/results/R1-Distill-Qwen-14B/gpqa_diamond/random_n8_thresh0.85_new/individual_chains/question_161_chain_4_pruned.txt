Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me read through it carefully.

So Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) that's operating at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment because that improves the electron microscopy by reducing scattering. But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there, and the mass spectrometer detected them. 

Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules when the system is in this vacuum state, called λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like the compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. But then, when he started the electron beam, something happened. The mean free path changed. Instead of being λ1, it became λ2. And the temperature remained the same during all this. So the question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Hmm, okay. I remember that the mean free path of gas molecules is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, with lower pressure, the mean free path is longer because molecules don't collide as much. But wait, the scenario here is that the initial vacuum state gives a mean free path λ1. Then, when the electron beam is on, the mean free path becomes λ2.

Wait, so why would the mean free path change? The pressure is the same because Mike's pumps are running, and the temperature is the same. So the initial conditions (pressure, temperature, compartment volume) are the same. So why is the mean free path different?

Oh, maybe the electron beam affects the gas molecules. Like, when the electrons are moving through the sample, they might interact with the gas molecules. But wait, the mean free path is about the gas molecules colliding with each other, right? Or does it include collisions with other things, like the walls of the compartment or the electron beam?

Wait, the mean free path λ is given by the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the average diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. But wait, maybe I got that wrong. Another formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. Since n is proportional to pressure (n = P/(kT)), then λ is proportional to 1/(P*sqrt(T)), but temperature is same here, so λ is proportional to 1/P.

Wait, but in this case, the pressure wasn't changed. So why would λ change? Unless something else is affecting the effective pressure or the effective collisions.

Wait, but the question says that when the electron beam is initiated, the mean free path changes. So maybe the electron beam affects the gas. Like, perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized or excited, changing their properties. Or maybe the electrons cause the gas molecules to move or collide more or less frequently.

Wait, or perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces some sort of electric field that affects the motion of the gas molecules, which in turn affects their mean free path. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be more likely to scatter
