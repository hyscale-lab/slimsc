Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about figuring out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of steps. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let me try to break it down.

First, I need to identify the target molecule's structure. The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's count the positions: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, wait, actually, in benzene numbering, the substituents are given the lowest possible numbers. So the numbering should be such that the substituents are as low as possible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). Let's imagine the benzene ring with these three groups in the 1,2,3 positions. Since benzene is symmetric, I need to figure out the order in which these groups are introduced.

The substituents are all meta or para directors, except ethoxy which is an activating group (ortho/para director) and nitro, which is deactivating (meta director). But wait, ethoxy is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group (since it's an O- with two lone pairs, but wait, waitâ€”no, wait. Ethoxy is an electron-donating group via resonance, making the ring more reactive. So it's an activating group but is an ortho/para director.

But introducing substituents in the correct order is key. Also, considering the directing effects, the order in which the substituents are added will affect where the next substituents attach.

In the target molecule, we have three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. Let's think about the possible order of introducing them. So, perhaps, the first substituent should be a strong activating group, followed by others.

Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, it's usually introduced last because it deactivates the ring, making further substitutions harder. Wait, but wait: sometimes you can nitrate after other groups are in place.

Alternatively, sometimes you introduce nitro groups early, but since it's deactivating, subsequent reactions would require more forcing conditions. Hmm, but in the target molecule, the nitro is at position 3. Let me try drawing this.

Suppose the benzene ring is numbered such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Then, the substituents are adjacent to each other, 1,2,3. Alternatively, maybe the numbering is different, but the key is their relative positions.

Wait, maybe I should think about the directing effects step by step. Let's imagine the first substitution is tert-butyl. Since t
