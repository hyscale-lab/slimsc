Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Oh wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Alright, first, let's tackle the initial dilution. When you mix equal volumes of acid and water, the concentration halves. Because concentration is moles over volume. So the original moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but sometimes during dilution, the volume changes? Oh, but for the purpose of dilution calculation, using the volumes directly is okay because the solution is diluted by a factor of 2.

Next, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid.

So let's calculate the equivalence point. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question asks for 25% titration, not the equivalence point. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, wait. No, wait. At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of the equivalence moles. So moles of NaOH at 25% is 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³, which matches. So at this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

So, for the first part, the pH at 25% titration. Let's think about what's happening here. When you add some NaOH, you convert some acetic acid into its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and sodium acetate. The pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Let me calculate the moles after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, the moles of CH3COOH will decrease by this amount, and the moles of CH3COO^- will increase by the same.

Initial moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 mol. After adding NaOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume now is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So Ka is 1.85e
