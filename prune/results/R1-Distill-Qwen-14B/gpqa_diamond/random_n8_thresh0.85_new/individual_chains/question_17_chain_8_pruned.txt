Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and this affects their concentration in solution.

The question says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, so the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. And the condition is that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its proper form to complex with Ca²+ ions. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so no real effect there. The K for Ca-EDTA is given as 5x10^10, which is a pretty large number, indicating a stable complex.

Wait, so the complex is Ca-EDTA, and since it's stoichiometric, the formula is probably CaY²- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. So the complex dissociates as CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-. But wait, no, because if the complex is Ca-EDTA, then the dissociation would be CaY²- ⇌ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. Actually, wait, the given K is 5e10. But is this the formation constant or the dissociation constant? Because K for formation is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). The dissociation constant would be Kd = 1/Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA]/[CaY²-].

Wait, the problem states KCa-EDTA is 5e10. I think KCa-EDTA is the formation constant, Kf. So Kf = 5e10 = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]).

But wait, in the solution, the only source of Ca²+ is from the dissociation of the complex, right? Because if the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, then initially, without any dissociation, [CaY²-] would be 0.02 M. But some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me denote the concentration of Ca²+ produced as x. So, when the complex dissociates, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = x, and [CaY²-] = 0.02 - x. But wait, wait, wait. Since the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaY²-, and each mole of CaY²- dissociates into one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4- (I think), then the change is +x for both, so the [CaY²-] becomes 0.02 - x. But because Kf is so large (5e10), this is a very stable complex, so the dissociation x would be small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That simplifies the equation.

So Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][ED
