Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but I'll try to think it through. Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? Metathesis is when the catalyst breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. The Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene, typically used for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis, but it can also do cross metathesis.

So the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule has a double bond, maybe it's a geometric isomer? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃? Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Oh wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)CH2? Wait, maybe I should number the carbons. Let me write it correctly.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that would be too long. Wait, no. Pent has five carbons in a chain. So, 3-methyl would be at the third carbon of the chain. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that makes sense. So the molecule is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3. Wait, but wait, the double bond is at position 1, so the
