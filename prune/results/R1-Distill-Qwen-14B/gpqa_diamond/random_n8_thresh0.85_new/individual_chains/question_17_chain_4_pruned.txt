Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when it's a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on EDTA and complex ions, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its proper form, like with all the necessary protons bound or something. Temperature is 25Â°C, but I don't think that affects this particular calculation.

Wait, okay, EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So, in this case, it's complexed with calcium. The complex is Ca-EDTA, and the solution has 0.02 M of this complex. So, the question is, what's the concentration of free calcium ions in solution?

I remember that the formation constant K is given by K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). Oh wait, but wait. EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. But the question says the pH is ideal, so I think that the assumption is that EDTA is in its fully deprotonated form, which is EDTA^4- (Y^4-). So, in this case, the solution has a lot of Y^4- ions available.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, in the presence of EDTA, the metal ion is chelated, so the free EDTA in solution is Y^4-. So, the formation constant equation should be K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

Right, because the complex is CaY^2- (since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so when it binds Ca^2+ which has a +2 charge, the complex would have a charge of 2-? Or wait, Ca^2+ is +2, EDTA^4- is -4. So together, CaY^2- would be 2- + (-4) = -2. Wait, no, Ca is +2 and EDTA is ^4-. So the complex would have a charge of +2 + (-4) = -
