Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and their speed in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is moving through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium isn't just c/n, but that's from the medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed? Oh right, this is going to involve some relativity, maybe?

Wait, no. Wait, the speed of light in a medium is c/n in that medium's rest frame. But when the medium is moving, the observer in the lab would see the light's speed as different? Or is it the same as c? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, Einstein's postulate says that the speed of light in a vacuum is c in all inertial frames. But here, the light is in a medium (glass), so it's not a vacuum. So the speed would be different. But how?

Let me think. The glass is moving. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving within the glass, so I need to find its speed relative to the lab.

In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So v_glass = c/n.

Now, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So we need to transform the velocity of the light in the glass's frame to the lab frame. Wait, but the direction matters.

Wait, the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the glass's frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, the light's speed is c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Hmm, so I need to find the speed of the light from the lab's perspective. So I think I should use
