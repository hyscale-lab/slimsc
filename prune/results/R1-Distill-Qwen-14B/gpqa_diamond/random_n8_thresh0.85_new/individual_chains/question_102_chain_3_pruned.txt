Okay, so I've got this biology question here about a ligand-receptor pair and some genetic constructs. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. That means the vector has two coding regions (bicistronic) and uses loxP sites for recombination. So the ligand and receptor are on the same vector but are under different promoters or something?

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so it might allow the receptor to be expressed without the need for a separate promoter. Oh, but wait, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the receptor is IRES-driven? So both could be expressed from the same transcript?

The vector is bicistronic, so it's one transcript with two ORFs. The ligand is at the 5' end, followed by mCherry, but there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) between the ligand ORF and mCherry. Then the receptor is at the 3' end, with eGFP at the C-terminus. There's another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) between the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, so in the construct, the ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop cassette is in between. So when would the ligand and mCherry be expressed? Oh, because of the stop, unless something removes it. Oh, Cre recombinase would excise the loxP sites. So the ligand-mCherry would only be expressed if the loxP-stop is removed, right? Because without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would not because of the stop. Or wait, maybe the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry only when the stop is removed.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', then stop, then mCherry? Or is the ligand followed by a stop, and then mCherry is another ORF? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs in one mRNA. So the first ORF is ligand, followed by mCherry, but they're separated by a stop cassette. So without Cre, ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would not because the stop is in the way. But with Cre, the loxP sites would be recognized, and the stop would be removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed as part of the ligand? Or maybe the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry when the stop is removed?

Alternatively, maybe the ligand is under CBA and is followed by stop, then mCherry, but the stop is in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the stop is present, so the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is not. When Cre is present, it removes the stop, so the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry. Similarly, the receptor is followed by eGFP with another stop cassette, which might use a different lox site (lox2272). So Cre would excise that stop, allowing eGFP to be expressed with the receptor.

Wait, but in the setup, the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher made a bicistronic vector so that when Cre is present, both the ligand and receptor would be expressed as fusion proteins. Because the stop cassettes are flanked by lox sites, Cre would remove them, allowing the respective fluorescent proteins to be expressed.

So the Cre is coming from SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think. So when the Cre is expressed, it would delete the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed along with their respective fluorescent tags (mCherry and eGFP).

But in the experiment, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. After the offspring are born, they're visualized under a confocal. They don't observe a green signal, which is eGFP. So eGFP isn't being expressed. Hmm.

Wait, the eGFP is fused to the receptor. So perhaps the receptor isn't being expressed correctly. Let me think about the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct expresses both, so if they're in a paracrine, maybe the cells are not adjacent. But why would that prevent eGFP from being expressed? I don't think this is the main issue here. The question is about expression, not
