Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator given a specific state. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so it's not normalized yet. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors need to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should equal 1.

So, let's write down the state. Let me denote |up> as the first basis vector and |down> as the second. So, the state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). But wait, it's proportional to that, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but we need to normalize it.

To normalize, I should calculate the norm squared of the vector. The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2. Let's compute each:

|a|^2 = |1+i|^2. The magnitude of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

|b|^2 = |2 - i|^2. The magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 +1) = sqrt(5), so squared is 5.

Adding them together, the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>. Got it.

Now, the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The problem states that Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the basis states are |up> and |down>, which are two-dimensional. So the matrix will be 2x2.

Let me write down the matrix. For a 2x2 matrix, when i≠j, Aij = hbar/2. The diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0          hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2     0     ]

So, the operator is:

A = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]]

Wait, no, because when i≠j, Aij = ħ/2. So yes, that's the matrix. So A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

But wait, what operator does this represent? The Pauli X matrix is the spin-flip operator, and it's related to the spin in the x-direction. But in this case, A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of the x-component of spin.

But wait, the question is about measuring the particle in the eigenstates of operator A. So we need to find the probability of getting each eigenvalue when measuring in the basis of A.

Alternatively, since the operator A is given, and the state is in the computational basis (|up> and |down>), we can compute the probabilities by projecting the state onto the eigenstates of A.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to note that the operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The eigenvalues of the Pauli X matrix are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1) → ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But wait, when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. So when measuring A, the possible results are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

But wait, the question is phrased as "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator". Hmm, phrasing is a bit tricky. Oh, wait, no, because in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable (operator), the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are given by the square of the amplitude in the corresponding eigenstate.

Wait, so the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. So to find the probabilities, I need to express the state |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and then the coefficients squared will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, the measurement probabilities can be found by the expectation values when projecting onto |+x> and |−x>.

Wait, let me think. The state |alpha> is in the z-basis. The operator whose eigenstates we're measuring in is the x-basis, since A is proportional to σ_x.

So, the probabilities would be the square of the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A.

So, first, what are the eigenstates of A?

The Pauli X matrix σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, with corresponding eigenvectors:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The eigenvectors for σ_x are:

For eigenvalue +1: (1,1)/sqrt(2)
For eigenvalue -1: (1,-1)/sqrt(2)

So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait again. Let's make it right. The eigenstates of σ_x are:

|+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2), which for spin-1/2, |up> is often |+z> and |down> is |−z>, so the x-eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for |+x> and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for |-x>.

Wait, no, more accurately, the eigenstates of σ_x are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, to find the probability of getting eigenvalue ħ/2 (which corresponds to |+x>), I need to compute |<+x| alpha>|^2.

Similarly, the probability for eigenvalue -ħ/2 is |< -x | alpha>|^2. 

So, let's compute <+x| alpha>.

First, express |alpha> in terms of the z-basis:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>

And |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product < +x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly.

The inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Because <+x | up> = 1/sqrt(2), and <+x | down> = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, no. The inner product of |+x> with |alpha> is:

< +x | alpha > = [ <up| + <down| ] / sqrt(2) ) * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

So that becomes (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 - i)(1) ) ].

Wait, because < up | up > is 1, < down | down> is 1, and cross terms are zero since they're orthogonal.

So, let me compute the numerator inside the brackets:

(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3 + 0i. So, overall, < +x | alpha > is (3)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))).

So the amplitude is 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.6428.

Wait, but let me check that again. Because when I add (1+i) and (2-i), I get 3. So yes, the amplitude is 3/(sqrt(14)). So the probability is (9)/(14) ≈ 0.6428.

Similarly, for the |-x> case.

< -x | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) * (-1) ) ]

Because |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So the inner product would be:

[ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Compute numerator: (1 + i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i + i) = (-1) + (2i) = (-1 + 2i).

So the amplitude is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

The absolute square is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

Wait, wait: (−1 + 2i) in the numerator. So when I take the absolute value squared, it's (−1)^
