Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics states that the uncertainty in an observable (like P_z) is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The state given is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me note that down. The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means the matrix representations provided for P_x, P_y, and P_z are in the P_z eigenbasis. That should make things easier because the matrices are already in a diagonal form (for P_z) or non-diagonal for the others.

Wait, looking at the matrix for P_z, it's diagonal with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So P_z has eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ corresponding to the basis states |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩. The given state is a linear combination of these basis vectors.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. But wait, I should check if this state is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4
(1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2
(-1/2)^2 = 1/4
Sum = 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = 1. So it's normalized. Good, so no need to normalize it.

Now, the state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. But since we're dealing with P_z, I just need to compute the expectation values.

First, let's find ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, this should be straightforward. Each component corresponds to the eigenvalue multiplied by the amplitude squared.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = ( -1/2 )^2 * (ħ) + (1/sqrt(2))^
