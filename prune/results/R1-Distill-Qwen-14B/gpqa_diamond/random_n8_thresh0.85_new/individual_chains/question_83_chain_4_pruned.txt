Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will produce its conjugate base, acetate ions. 

So, let me start by figuring out the initial concentrations after dilution. When you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be: Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid. Let's find out how much NaOH is needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (as calculated earlier). Since NaOH reacts 1:1 with acetic acid, the moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001. The volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the problem asks about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Or wait, wait, 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. Hmm, wait, no, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, right? So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. 

At 25% titration, only 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O, the moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025, and the moles of acetate will increase by the same amount.

Let me think about the initial concentrations after mixing with water. The diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. At 25% titration, a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles? Wait, no. Wait, the initial moles were 0.001 (from the 20 cm³ 0.05 M). Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH gives 0.00025 moles of NaOH, which reacts with acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And the moles of acetate produced are 0.00025.

But wait, the total solution volume now is the initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's compute that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^- ] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa ≈ 4.74 (since log(1.85) is around 0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733).

So plugging in:

pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263. So about 4.26.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for accuracy. Let me compute 0.00075 / 0.0425:

0.00075 divided by 0.0425. Hmm, 0.0425 is 42.5 mL. 0.00075 moles in 42.5 mL is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. Correct.

And 0.00025 moles in 42.5 mL is 0.005882 M. Correct.

The ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333. So yes, log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263, which rounds to 4.26. So 25% titration pH is approximately 4.26.

Looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. So maybe the first value is 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will be of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic.

At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added are equal to the moles of acetic acid. As calculated earlier, that's 0.001 moles of NaOH. The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 10 cm³, which is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

To find the pH, we can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, the expression becomes:

5.405e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So:

x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11

x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is log(1/(1.04e-5)) → wait, no, pOH = -log[OH^-] = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake here because the Kb is 5.405e-10, not 5.405e-5. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no, because 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 is approximately 5.405e-10. Correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-1
