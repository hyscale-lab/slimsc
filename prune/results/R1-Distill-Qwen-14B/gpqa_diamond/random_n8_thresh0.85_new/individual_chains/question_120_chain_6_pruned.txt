Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's break this down.

I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and one with 0.5 parsec is twice as far.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So if I imagine a sphere of radius r, the number of stars inside would be proportional to the volume of the sphere. The volume is (4/3)πr³, right? So number of stars N is proportional to r³, or N ∝ r³.

Now, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. Which means d = 1/plx. So if I'm considering a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx (a small range), the corresponding distances are from d =1/plx to d' = 1/(plx + dplx). But wait, maybe I should consider a thin shell between distance d and d + dd. The number of stars in that shell would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the volume density.

Wait, but in this case, the density is uniform, so number of stars in a shell is 4πd² dd multiplied by the number density (stars per unit volume). Let's say the number density is n. So N_shell = n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let's change variables from d to plx. So dd would be the derivative of d with respect to plx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = -1/(plx²) dplx. Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases. So when plx increases by a small amount dplx, d decreases by (1/plx²) dplx. But since we're interested in the number of stars, maybe the negative isn't an issue because we're taking the absolute value.

Wait, let me get this straight. If I have a thin shell at distance d, the number of stars in a thin shell of thickness dd is N_shell = n * 4πd² dd. Now, let's express this in terms of plx.

Since plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So substituting, N_shell = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * dd. But how does dd relate to dplx? Because plx is a function of d. So, plx = 1/d => d = 1/plx. Taking derivatives, dd = -dplx / (plx^2). Hmm, so if I'm considering a small change dplx in parallax, the corresponding change in d is dd = (-1/plx²) dplx. But since d is decreasing as plx increases, the actual number should be positive. So perhaps when I change variables, I should take the absolute value.

So, let me write N_shell in terms of plx. So,

N_shell
