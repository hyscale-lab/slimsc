Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics. Relativity comes into play. So I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed.

Wait, the problem says two astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. Their masses are 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. But when considering relative velocity, I think it's the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity since they're both moving at significant fractions of c.

Oh right! The formula for adding velocities in relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So I should plug in v1 as 0.6c and v2 as 0.5c.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. And the denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. That's roughly 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So looking at the options, I see options C and D have v_rel =0.14c, so that's a clue.

Now, the total energy. I think each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma * mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.
So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.
So energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 = 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 mc². That rounds to approximately 5.96 mc². 

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c, which matches both calculations. So the correct answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we use relativistic mechanics for both the relative velocity and total energy calculations.

### Relative Velocity
The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5 m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464 m c^2
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5 m c^2 + 3.464 m c^2 \approx 5.964 m c^2
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96 m c^2\).

### Final Answer
From the calculations, the relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\) and the total energy is \(E = 5.96 m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
