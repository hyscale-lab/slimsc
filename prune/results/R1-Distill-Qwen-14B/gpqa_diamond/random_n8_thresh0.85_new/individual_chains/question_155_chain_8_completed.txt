Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty of P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, when the system is in a state |ψ>, is given by the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z. So, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). 

Wait, but wait. I think the formula is actually the square root of ⟨(P_z - ⟨P_z⟩)²⟩, which expands to sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)²). Right, okay.

So, the first thing I need to compute is the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩, and then the expectation of P_z squared, ⟨P_z²⟩. Then plug those into the formula.

Given that the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The matrix for P_z is given as:

[ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me write out the components. ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So, ψ† P_z is [ (-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0, ...? Wait no, matrix multiplication. Let me think.

Wait, P_z is diagonal, so when I do ψ† P_z, each component is (each element of ψ) multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z.

So ψ† P_z = [ (-1/2)*ħ , (1/√2)*0 , (-1/2)*(-ħ) ]

Wait, no, that's not how matrix multiplication works. ψ† is 1x3, P_z is 3x3. So the product ψ† P_z is 1x3. Let me compute each element.

First element: ( -1/2 ) * ħ + (1/√2)*0 + ( -1/2 )*0 = (-ħ/2)
Second element: (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = 0
Third element: (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) = (ħ/2)

So ψ† P_z = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]

Now multiply that by ψ, which is 3x1. So the product is:

(-ħ/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (ħ/2)*(-1/2)

Let me compute each term:

First term: (ħ/2)*(1/2) = ħ/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (ħ/2)*(-1/2) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0

Wait, so ⟨P_z⟩ is zero? That's interesting.

Now, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will have each diagonal element squared. So P_z^2 is:

[ [ (ħ)^2, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ( -ħ )^2 ] ]

Which simplifies to:

[ [ ħ², 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, ħ² ] ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z²⟩, I do ψ† P_z² ψ.

Again, since P_z² is diagonal, this will be the sum of each |ψ_i|² multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

The diagonal elements are ħ², 0, ħ².

The components of ψ are (-1/2), (1/√2), (-1/2). So their squares are (1/4), (1/2), (1/4).

So the sum is: (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Wait, so now compute ΔP_z.

ΔP_z = sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩^2 )

We already have ⟨P_z⟩ as 0, so this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, so the uncertainty is ħ divided by square root of 2. Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2 and option C is ħ/2. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Let me re-calculate ⟨P_z⟩. ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

P_z as a diagonal matrix, so when you apply it to ψ, you multiply each component by the diagonal element.

So P_z ψ is [ -1/2 * ħ, 0, -1/2 * (-ħ) ] = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ].

Then, ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† (P_z ψ) = (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

So sum is ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0, correct.

⟨P_z²⟩: the diagonal elements are ħ², 0, ħ².

So ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ² + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ².

Which is (1/4)ħ² + 0 + (1/4)ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So yes, ΔP_z is sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi$, we first calculate $P_z |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute $\langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{2} \right) \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \left( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) (0) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \right).
\]

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi$, note that $P_z^2$ is diagonal. Therefore:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 (\hbar^2) + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 (0) + \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
