Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the compound X is C11H12O. It undergoes a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to identify what X was from the options.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. Oh wait, that's DABCO, right? And when it reacts with epoxides, I think it's about ring-opening reactions. But wait, the product's NMR is given, so maybe I should first figure out what the product looks like and then work backward to find the starting material.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). Two singlets, each 3H. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Like maybe two CH3 groups attached to something deshielded or in an environment without neighboring Hs.

Then, the aromatic region:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So four signals in the aromatic region. Let's see: 1H doublet, then 2H doublet, another 1H doublet, and another 2H doublet. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with some substituents.

Wait, the 13C NMR has 9 signals, some of which are for carbons attached to other groups. Let me list them:

21.3 (s) – probably a CH3, maybe attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen or part of a benzene ring.

28.4 (s) – another CH3 or maybe a CH2, but more likely CH3 because adjacent groups would cause splitting. Wait, but if it's a singlet, maybe attached to something that doesn't split it, like a carbonyl or an electronegative group.

126.9 (2C, s) – these are probably carbons from a benzene ring, perhaps in a substitution pattern that makes them equivalent. Like para substituents, maybe.

127.1 (1C, s) – another aromatic carbon.

129.1 (2C, s) – maybe the carbons adjacent to substituents.

130.3 (1C, s) – another aromatic.

141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C, s) – these could be carbons attached to substituents, like a benzene ring with substituents, maybe a carbonyl group or an oxygen.

197.7 (1C, s) – that's a high chemical shift. Hmm, could be a carbonyl carbon, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something else. But wait, the starting material was an epoxide. Oh, wait. Alternatively, maybe an epoxide ring-opening leads to an carbonyl group? Or maybe elimination? Not sure yet.

Wait, let me think about the reaction conditions. The starting material is an epoxide, I think. Because the product is after reaction with DABCO. Oh, but DABCO is a base. Epoxides can react with bases in ring-opening reactions, typically leading to formation of alcohols or other oxygen-containing groups, but under certain conditions, maybe elimination?

Wait, but DABCO is a bulky base. So when an epoxide reacts with a bulky base, especially when the epoxide is strained, it tends to open in a ring-opening reaction. But since the starting material is an epoxide, and the product's NMR indicates certain groups, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening? Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait no, DABCO is a base, so maybe it deprotonates something, leading to an elimination or a ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide undergoes a ring-opening with DABCO as a base, leading to an alcohol.

Wait, no—epoxides can also undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but in a basic condition, perhaps it would ring-open in a different way. Alternatively, could it be a ring-opening via a nucleophilic attack?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves some other process, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me look at the product's structure based on the NMR.

So the product has two methyl groups (from the two singlets in 1H NMR), and the aromatic region suggests perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents that create a couple of doublets. Let me try to draw a structure.

Looking at the 1H NMR aromatic signals:

The signals at 6.75 (d, 1H), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 1H), 7.71 (d, 2H). Wait, that's four peaks, but they might be split because of coupling. Let me think about a benzene ring with substituents. If it's a para-substituted ring, the H's on the ring would be two doublets (each for two H's) and perhaps something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's a styrene-type structure, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think about the possible product structures.

Looking at the 13C NMR data: the high shift at 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl carbon. So the product has a carbonyl group. That suggests that the epoxide ring opened to form a ketone or similar.

Wait, if the starting material was an epoxide, and after reaction with DABCO, it forms a carbonyl group. How? Maybe via an elimination during the ring-opening. Let me think.

Epoxide ring-opening: when an epoxide is treated with a base, it can form an alkoxide, which can then eliminate a leaving group to form a carbonyl if there's a neighboring group.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide is part of an allyl system. For example, if compound X is a styrene oxide (an epoxide derived from styrene), then treatment with a base could lead to ring-opening to form a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get back. Let me imagine what the product's structure might be.

The product has two methyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a benzene ring with substituents. So maybe it's something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some branching.

Wait, the carbonyl (197.7 ppm) is probably a ketone since the molecular formula of X is C11H12O. Wait, but the product's formula would be the same if it's a rearrangement, right? Or wait, no, because the reaction is with DABCO, which is a reagent. Wait, DABCO is a catalyst in some reactions, like in the opening of epoxides?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide to form an alcohol, but the product's NMR doesn't show any obvious OH signals. So maybe it's an elimination.

Wait, but the product NMR includes a high chemical shift for a
