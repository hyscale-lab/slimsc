Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm. Let me think about this step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The options give different values for the relative speed (v_rel) and the total energy (E). So I need to calculate both of these.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities normally because that would give a speed faster than light, which isn't possible. I think the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Let me recall... Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, wait, but wait—wait, which one is u and which is v here? So astronaut A is 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut B is 3m moving at 0.5c. Both in the same direction, so from A's perspective, the relative speed of B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part down.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's total energy is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, but the astronauts have different masses and velocities. So I need to calculate each one's energy and sum them.

First astronaut (2m, 0.6c): gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 2m * gamma1 c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (3m, 0.5c): gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 3m * gamma2 c² ≈ 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. That matches. Option D's E is 5 mc², which is lower than what I found. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait a second, but why is the relative speed between the two 0.14c? Because one is moving faster than the other, from the perspective of the slower one? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the formula I used is (u - v), where u is the speed of the first object (0.6c) and v is the speed of the second (0.5c). So when calculating the relative speed of B from A's frame, it's (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - 0.6c*0.5c/c²), which is correct. So that gives approximately 0.14c. So yes, the relative speed is about 0.14c. So option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed \( v_{\text{rel}} \) of two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (for the astronaut with mass \( 2m \)) and \( v = 0.5c \) (for the astronaut with mass \( 3m \)). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

The numerator is \( 0.1c \), and the denominator is:

\[
1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

So, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (\( 2m, 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = 2m \cdot \gamma_1 c^2 = 2m \cdot 1.25c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (\( 3m, 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.8660} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = 3m \cdot \gamma_2 c^2 \approx 3m \cdot 1.1547c^2 \approx 3.4641mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5mc^2 + 3.4641mc^2 \approx 5.9641mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
