Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is related to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, what exactly do I need to do here?

Let me read the question again. It says that 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. And I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are A to D, some in kcal and some in kJ. Oh right, I'll need to be careful about the units.

Wait, I think the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. But when mixing different acids and a base, I have to figure out how much H+ and OH- are present. Oh, but wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be, but in most cases, especially in solution, it's considered to donate two H+ ions. Or does it depend on concentration? Hmm, perhaps I should assume that H2SO4 provides two H+ ions per molecule.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

So the reaction would be H+ + OH- â†’ H2O, and each mole of H+ and OH- produces a certain amount of heat. The enthalpy change is usually about -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed, if I remember correctly. But wait, I think the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is around -57.3 kJ/mol because it's assumed to be a complete reaction.

So the key is to find the total moles of H+ and OH-, and see which is the limiting reactant because the enthalpy change is based on how much actually reacts.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate moles of H+ from each acid.

1. HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L
