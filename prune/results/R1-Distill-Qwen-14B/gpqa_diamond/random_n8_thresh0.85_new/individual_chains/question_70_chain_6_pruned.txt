Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes several reactions, and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that these are all symmetry point groups, part of the crystallographic point group classification. So, I need to figure out what E is first, then determine its molecular symmetry.

Let's break down the reactions given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, bright red product... that makes me think of something like copper(II) sulfate or maybe a transition metal compound. Oh, wait, another bright red solid I remember is mercury(II) sulfide, but that's more of a deep red. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or something else.

Wait, the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, dangerous products could be things like phosgene, sarin gas, or other highly toxic substances. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like ozone or something else.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Okay, so when C is in water, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Strong acid could be HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acid could be something like acetic acid, H3PO4 (but that's more moderate), or something else.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. Hmm, D and B in 1:1 ratio gives a solvent. Solvents could be things like ethanol, water, maybe something like THF or DMF, but let's think about the reactants.

Let me try to identify each compound.

First, reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Let's think about possible A and B. Maybe A is copper metal (Cu) and B is sulfur (S) gas? But 8 equivalents... wait, 8 is a lot. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is something else, but sodium with 8 equivalents of something... I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if B is Cl2 (chlorine gas), perhaps. Let's think about the 8 equivalents. If A is sodium (Na), then 8 moles of Cl2 would maybe form NaCl? But sodium is a solid, Cl2 is a gas. 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's 1 mole of Cl2. So 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2, but that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe A is another metal.

Wait, another approach: If C is a compound that, when reacted with water, gives a strong acid and a weak acid. So when C is in water, it dissociates into A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). Let's think about possible C.

Let me consider that C could be a sulfite or a sulfate. Wait, but when it reacts with water, it gives A plus two acids. For example, if C is a sulfite salt, maybe. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate salt. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that C is a metal sulfide. Because when sulfides react with water, they can produce H2S (a weak acid, but in this case, F is strong, G is weak). Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Wait, if C is a metal oxide, then when it reacts with water, it would form a metal hydroxide. But that doesn't seem to fit because F and G are acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a metal carbonate. When carbonate reacts with water, it might produce CO2 (a weak acid) and the corresponding hydroxide. But then A would be the metal hydroxide, which when decomposed... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking at reaction 4. D and B in 1:1 ratio form H, a solvent. Let's think about possible B and D. For example, B is Cl2, D is maybe O2? But O2 doesn't react with Cl2 in 1:1. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2? No, that's not 1:1. Wait, maybe B is H2S and D is something else, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let me try to think about product E. It's produced when C reacts with D in 2 equivalents. If E is extremely hazardous, maybe it's something like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O3 (ozone), but ozone isn't that stable. Or maybe it's something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in small quantities.

Wait, another approach, think about the reaction where C (when reacted with water) produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). Suppose F is H2SO4 (strong acid) and G is HCl (another strong acid?), but G is weak. Wait, no, HCl is a strong acid. Hmm, maybe G is something else, like H2S, which is a weak acid.

Wait, but F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. So maybe the reaction of C with water produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is a sulfite salt, like Na2SO3, then reacting with water might not produce two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide, like FeS. FeS reacts with water? Not sure.

Wait, what if C is a nitride, like Na3N. When it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base), but then F and G would be something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide, like PbS (which is bright red). Oh! Lead sulfide is
