Okay, so I've got this question about a genetics experiment involving some ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my molecular biology, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let me parse the question. The setup is that a researcher created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So the ligand and receptor are probably on the same vector, each under their own promoters or something.

The vector structure is described as follows: the ligand's ORF (open reading frame) is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Then the receptor ORF is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, so the ligand is first, then the receptor comes after. But there are stop cassettes in between them.

More specifically, between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh, I remember that loxP sites are recognized by Cre recombinase. So if Cre is present, it can excise the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think. The receptor is under an IRES element, which is an internal ribosome entry site. IRES allows for the translation of the downstream gene without the need for a full promoter, usually in the same mRNA as another gene.

So the setup in the vector is: CBA promoter drives the transcription of the ligand ORF, then a stop cassette with loxP, then mCherry. Then, after that, the IRES element drives the receptor ORF, followed by a stop cassette with lox2272, and then eGFP.

Wait, but in a bicistronic vector, two genes are expressed from the same mRNA. So the first gene (ligand) is under CBA, then the IRES would drive the second gene (receptor). But the way the question is phrased, the ligand is at 5', then the stop, then mCherry. Hmm, perhaps the vector is arranged as ligand followed by mCherry under the same promoter, but with a stop in between. Then the receptor is after the IRES, which is after the ligand construct.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The vector is bicistronic, meaning two ORFs in one mRNA. The way it's described is that the ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at 3' fused to eGFP. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop cassette. Between receptor and eGFP is another stop cassette. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed as a fusion with mCherry, but the receptor would not be expressed because the stop cassette is in the way. Or wait, no, because the receptor is under IRES.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the construct. The vector has two coding regions: ligand and receptor. The setup is such that the ligand is first, followed by a stop, then mCherry. Receptor is after the IRES, then a stop, then eGFP.

But how is the IRES used here? IRES allows for the translation of a second ORF in the same mRNA. So the mRNA would first produce the ligand (perhaps with mCherry), then the IRES would drive the translation of the receptor (with eGFP). But in this case, both ORFs are flanked by stop cassettes.

Wait, but the presence of the stop cassettes would prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise them. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand's ORF is followed by a stop, so ligand won't be expressed. But
