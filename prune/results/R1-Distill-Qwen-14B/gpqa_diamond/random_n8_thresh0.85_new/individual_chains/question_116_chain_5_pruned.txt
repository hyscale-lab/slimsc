Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's take it step by step. 

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns can tell us about the neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet suggests each is next to three. 

Looking at the integration, 6H and 4H. Hmm. So 6 hydrogens as a triplet, maybe from two equivalent CH3 groups. Because each CH3 has 3H, so two CH3 groups would account for 6H. And the quartet is 4Hâ€”maybe from two CH2 groups. Wait, but that would be 4H, so maybe it's part of a chain or a ring. 

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 0.9 is probably from two CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH2CH3 has 3H in the CH3, but wait, no. Wait, for splitting. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely for two methyl groups attached to something. Let me think: if each methyl is next to a CH2 group, then each CH3 would split into a triplet. Because each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2 which has two Hs. So for each CH3, the splitting would be a triplet. So that fits the 6H as two CH3 groups. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H, which could be two CH2 groups. If each CH2 is next to another CH2, each H would be split into a quartet. Because each H in the CH2 would see the two neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2. So maybe it's a structure like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that seems too long. Or maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ethane. Wait another idea: maybe it's a diethyl group attached to something. Because diethyl groups would give two CH2CH3 groups. 

Wait, but let's think about the integration: 6H for the triplet and 4H for the quartet. So the 6H is two CH
