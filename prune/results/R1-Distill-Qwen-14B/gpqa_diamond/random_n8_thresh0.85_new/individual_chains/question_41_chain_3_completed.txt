Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium as observed from a laboratory frame. Hmm, right, I remember something about relative motion and how light speed is involved.

So the setup: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I think I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So if the glass is moving, does that affect the speed of light inside it as measured in the lab frame?

Wait a second, the light is in the glass. The glass's index of refraction is n, so the speed of light in the glass, when at rest, is v_glass = c/n, right? Because I remember the formula v = c/n. So when the glass is stationary, the speed is c/n.

But what happens when the glass is moving? The lab frame sees the glass moving at velocity v. How does that affect the speed of the light in that moving medium?

Hmm, maybe I should think about this using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly; you have to consider the Lorentz transformations.

So, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light inside is moving at velocity u' in the glass's rest frame. From the glass's perspective, the light's speed is u' = c/n — that's the speed in its own frame.

But to find the speed in the lab frame, we can use the velocity addition formula. The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² )

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the direction matters. Because the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at v towards the observer, but the light in the glass is moving in the same direction (since the beam is propagating through the glass in the direction of motion). So we need to compute the velocity of the light as observed in the lab.

So, applying the velocity addition formula. Let me think: in the glass's frame, the light's velocity is u' = c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass frame (since the glass is moving at v in the lab), we can use the formula.

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula goes the other way. The lab frame sees the glass moving at v. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the light's velocity in the glass's frame is u', and we need to find u, the velocity of the light in the lab frame.

The formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v) / c² )

But wait, wait a minute. Because u' is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame. So u' is c/n, but wait, wait, in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n towards the direction of motion, which is the same as the lab's direction. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

So substituting u' = c/n into the formula:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: ( (c v)/(n c²) ) is v/(n c). So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c )

So numerator is (c + n v)/n.

So u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Dividing these fractions: multiply numerator by reciprocal of denominator.

So [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ] 

Wait, wait. Let me compute this:

Numerator: (c + n v) * n c
Denominator: n (n c + v)

Wait, no. Wait, the numerator after multiplication is (c + n v) * n c, and denominator is n (n c +v).

Wait, no. Let me go through it again. The numerator: (c + n v)/n multiplied by n c/(n c + v).

So:

= [ (c + n v) * n c ] / [ n (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels.

= [ (c + n v) c ] / (n c + v )

So u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

But wait, c is 1, right? Because the question says take c=1. So substituting:

u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So the speed of light in the glass, as observed in the lab, is (1 + n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option A says (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's what I got.

But wait, wait another thing. The problem says the speed of light in the glass. Wait, no. Wait, the question is: the speed of light in glass relative to the observer. Wait, no. Wait, the question is: the speed of light in glass relative to the observer.

Wait, no. The speed of light in the glass is v_glass = c/n = 1/n when the glass is stationary. But when the glass is moving, the observed speed is (1 +n v )/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, is the velocity of the light in the glass the same as the speed we calculated? Because the glass is moving, the light's speed in the lab is u, which is the observed speed. So the answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing something else. Let me think again. The light in the moving glass is moving with velocity u as observed in the lab. But the speed of light in the glass, in the lab frame, is u. So the answer is u = (1 +nv)/(n +v ), which is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the light is propagating through the glass with an index of refraction \( n \). The speed of light in a stationary glass is \( v_{\text{glass}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 1 \) in this case.

When the glass is moving, the observed speed of the light in the laboratory frame must account for the relative motion of the glass. This requires using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u' \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, which is \( \frac{c}{n} \).
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.
- \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Substituting \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this becomes:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n}
\]

Thus, the formula for \( u \) becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. The other options do not correctly account for the relativistic velocity addition or the relationship between the speed of light in the glass and the laboratory frame.
