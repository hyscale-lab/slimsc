Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we have three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the enthalpy change when these are mixed together.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization usually involves an acid reacting with a base to form water. The typical reaction is something like H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change is around -57 kJ/mol, but I think that's for strong acids and bases. But wait, in this case, we have multiple acids and a base. So maybe I need to figure out how much acid and base we have in total.

Wait, the problem is mixing HCl (a strong acid), H2SO4 (another strong acid, but it's diprotic, so it donates two H+ ions), and Ba(OH)2 (a strong base, which I think dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions). So when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with OH- ions from the base.

But first, I should calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base.

Let me start with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. The volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives 2 H+. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. The volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Therefore, OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4. So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

The reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O. But since the moles are different, the one with the lesser moles will be the limiting reactant.

H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and there will be 0.08 moles of H+ left.

So the reaction produces 0.2 moles of H2O.

Wait, but wait. Neutralization is exothermic, so the enthalpy change will be negative. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed, but wait, I think that's per mole of H+ neutralized. Or is it per mole of water? I might be getting this mixed up.

Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from an acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a base to form one mole of H2O. So it's approximately -57 kJ per mole of H2O.

So for each mole of H2O formed, the enthalpy change is -57 kJ. So if we have 0.2 moles of H2O formed, the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, sometimes the value is given per mole of acid reacting. Wait, but no, the standard value is per mole of water.

Wait, another approach: the total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2 (since OH- is 0.2). So each mole of H
