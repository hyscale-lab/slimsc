Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I remember is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism since it's antisymmetric too.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. I know that in four-dimensional spacetime, each field has a certain mass dimension. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension [ψ] is 3/2 because the action is dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4 (since the integral over d^4x gives dimension 4 to the action). So the term ψ̄ ψ would have dimensions [ψ̄][ψ] = (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. But here, the term is more complicated.

Looking at the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break it down. σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which for electromagnetism is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1. So each term in F is [∂][A], and since A is a gauge field, its dimension is 1, I think. Because Maxwell's term is F^2, which has dimension 4, so each F is dimension 2. So [F^{μν}] = 2.

Now, let's compute the dimensions of each part. ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is [ψ̄][σ][ψ] which is (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) = 3. Then multiply by F^{μν}, which adds 2, so the whole term without κ is dimension 3 + 2 =5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so κ must adjust that. So the dimension for κ is 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M is -1. That points me to options A or C.

But wait, let me double-check. The term is κ times ψ̄ σψ F. So the product inside is [ψ̄ ψ] is 3, [F] is 2. So 3+2=5. Since the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, κ must have dimension -1. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Renormalizability depends on the coupling's mass dimension. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension ≤4 in four spacetime dimensions. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: The superficial degree of divergence determines renormalizability. If the coupling has dimension greater than 4, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait, the mass dimension of the coupling in an interaction term tells us about the renormalizability. For a term like L_int = g φ^n, the dimension of g is [g] = 4 - n [φ], where [φ] is the mass dimension of the field. If [g] >0, then the term is relevant (superficial degree of divergence D is positive, so it can lead to divergent loops without counterterms?), wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up.

Alternatively, the rule is that a theory is renormalizable if all terms in the Lagrangian have dimension ≤4. So each term in L must have dimension 4. So for each term, the coupling's dimension must be such that the term is dimension 4.

In our case, the
