Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution contains two different salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that these are phosphate buffer solutions, so the phosphate ions in solution might form a buffer system. 

Wait, the problem gives me the masses of each salt and the volume of the solution. Oh right, I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO4^2- or maybe PO4^3-? No, wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates into H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3- depending on the pH. Oh right, the problem is about orthophosphate ions, which I think refers to HPO4^2-.

But wait, looking at the salts: KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters of crystallization, so when it dissolves, it gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. 

Since these are a weak acid and its conjugate base, the solution should act as a buffer. The pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The relevant Ka here would be the second dissociation step because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Here, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So first, I need to calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. Then, find the pH using the pKa2 value, and then determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. Let's calculate the moles of each.

The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The mass of KH2PO4 is 1.00 g. Its molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.00734 mol. So 0.00734 moles of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, the mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 g. Its molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.00561 mol. Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-, so that's 0.00561 moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in solution, the Na2HPO4 will dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So yes, each mole gives one HPO4^2-.

So the concentrations in the solution are [H2PO4^-] = moles / volume = 0.00734 / 0.2 L ≈ 0.0367 M. Similarly, [HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02805 M.

Now, applying Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pKa2 is the negative log of Ka2. Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 ≈ log(6.2e-8) is around 7.21 (since 1e-7 is pH7, 6.2e-8 is closer to 7.2; wait, let me calculate it properly.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207 (since log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 7.79? Wait, no. Wait, 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 10^-8. So log(6.2) is 0.792, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.792 - 8 = -7.208. So pKa2 is 7.208 approximately.
