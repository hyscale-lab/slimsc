Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to these concepts. Let's try to take it step by step. The question has two reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each, then select the correct option from A to D.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So conditions are likely for a conjugate addition or maybe an aldol reaction, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a Michael addition since ethyl acrylate is a Michael acceptor. Oh right, Michael addition is a type of conjugate addition where a nucleophile adds to the beta position of an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So the starting material is a cyclohexanone with substituents. Let me draw its structure. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1. The substituents at position 2 are ethyl and methyl? Wait, wait. Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group? Or maybe I misread. Wait, the substituents on the cyclohexane ring: position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Because the numbering is 2,6-dimethyl. So the ring has substituents at 2 (ethyl), 6 (methyl), and the ketone is at position 1.

Wait, no, the correct structure would be: the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group? Because 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl substituent, and position 6 has a methyl group. So the structure would be 1-keto, 2-ethyl, 2-methyl, 6-methyl.

So the ring has substituents at 1,2, and 6. Now, when reacting with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions, it's likely a conjugate addition. The cyclohexanone is a Michael donor because it's an enoneâ€”wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, the Michael reaction typically involves a nucleophile adding to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. In this case, ethyl acrylate is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor), and the cyclohexanone may act as the nucleophile? No, wait. Wait, no, perhaps the cyclohexanone is the donor, providing the nucleophilic enolate.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Michael addition: the nucleophile (enolate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (acceptor). So ethyl acrylate is the acceptor here. The enolate would come from the cyclohexanone.

So the cyclohexanone would form an enolate via depro
