Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, then predicting the product after a series of reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a couple of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) and a double bond and a ring, or other combinations.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

Let me try to interpret that. The 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton. But wait, no, waitâ€”wait, an aldehyde is usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Unless it's part of an aromatic system or something else. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton, like from a phenolic OH? But the shift is higher, so more likely an aldehyde. But wait, a triplet? Aldehydes are usually singlets, so maybe it's not an aldehyde. Or perhaps it's a different group.

Wait, another possibility: an alpha proton to a carbonyl group. Or maybe a vinylic proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Like in an enal (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde). The triplet might indicate coupling with two adjacent protons. Hmm.

Looking at the other peaks. 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. That might be two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted on a benzene ring. Because in para substitution, each set of protons would be a doublet, coupling with each other. So, perhaps two benzene rings, each para-substituted. Or maybe one benzene ring with substituents in two different positions.

Wait, the 6.27 is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad suggests perhaps phenolic OH protons, but wait, in DMSO, OH protons might appear around 5 ppm? Or maybe in the presence of an exchange, but in CDCl3, they might be broader. Alternatively, maybe some vinylic protons in a conjugated system.

The 3.66 is a doublet for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group, or CH2 connected to something else.

Putting it together, perhaps the structure is something like a substituted benzaldehyde with some substituents. Alternatively, maybe a butenone or similar.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the atoms. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. So, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring attached to a functional group.

Let me think about the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: this is typically used for diazotization. So, probably a primary amine or an aryl amine is being converted into a diazonium salt. But wait, the starting compound has an N in it. So, perhaps the compound has an amine group. But wait, the molecular formula has one N, so maybe it's a primary amine.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any NH protons. Hmmm. Another possibility: Maybe the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with an amino group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the reaction steps: after diazotization with NaNO2 and HCl, the next step is H2O. Then aqueous KOH and heat.

Wait, wait, the first step is diazotization, so the compound must have an amino group. So, the starting material has an amino group. But in the NMR data, I don't see any NH protons. That's confusing. Unless the NH is exchanging rapidly and not showing up, but in the given data, 9.72 is a triplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the amino group is part of an aromatic ring, like an aniline. So, in that case, the amino group is part of the substituent, but the NH protons may not appear in the NMR if they're exchanging quickly. But in the NMR, the 9.72 is just one proton as triplet. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the initial compound: molecular formula C8H9NO. Let me think of possible structures. Suppose it's a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents, including an NH group.

Wait, let me count the carbons. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If the substituent is a CH2NH2, that adds two carbons, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diphenylethylamine or something similar.

Wait, but perhaps the starting compound is a benzaldehyde with an amino substituent. For example, something like 4-aminophenyl aldehyde? But then the structure would be Ph-CH2-CHO, but that might not match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a side chain that includes an aldehyde and an amino group.

Wait, another approach: look at the reaction steps. Diazotization (step 1), then H2O, then KOH and heat.

Diazotization usually converts amines to diazonium salts. Then, in aqueous conditions, maybe a hydrolysis. For example, diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenols (if aryl amine) or other groups. Then, in the presence of KOH and heat, perhaps some elimination or other reactions.

Wait, but the starting material has an N. So, the starting molecule must have an amine group. Let me think: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, the amine could be a secondary or primary amine. But considering the reaction steps, it's more likely a primary amine because diazotization is typically used for primary aromatic amines.

So, the structure might have a benzene ring with substituents, including an aldehyde and an amino group.

Wait, let me
