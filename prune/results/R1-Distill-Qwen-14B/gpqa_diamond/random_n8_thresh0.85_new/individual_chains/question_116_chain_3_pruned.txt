Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, it undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to give Compound C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce Compound D. We need to find out which option D is.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, analyzing Compound A's NMR. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. Those are probably methyl groups, as they're downfield but not too much. Also, 6H suggests maybe two equivalent CH3 groups, each contributing 3H. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—those are likely CH2 groups. Wait, 4H, so maybe two CH2 groups, each with 2H. But why a quartet?

In NMR, splitting occurs based on neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two equivalent protons. So for the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H), each of these CH3 groups is adjacent to a CH2. Because the triplet integrates to 6H, perhaps two CH3 groups attached to a CH2 group that's next to another CH2. How does that structure look?

Wait, let me think. If you have (CH3)2CH-CH2CH2- something? No, maybe it's more like a neopentyl structure. Or perhaps it's a cyclopropane? No, wait, the 0.9 is for CH3, and the 1.3 is for CH2. Another thought: Maybe it's a diethyl group. Wait, no, diethyl would have more hydrogens. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where two CH3 groups are attached to a single CH2, which is next to two other CH2 groups.

Wait, the quartet (4H) is at 1.3 ppm. A quartet means each proton is next to three equivalent protons. Or wait, no—quartet arises when a
