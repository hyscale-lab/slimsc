Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given as A, B, C, D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated based on the reaction between an acid and a base. The neutralization reaction typically produces water and a salt. But wait, when there are multiple acids or bases, I need to figure out the limiting reagent because that will determine how much reaction actually happens.

Let me write down the information given:

- HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
- H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
- Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

Wait a minute, but wait, mixing these together. So, HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the reaction will be between the acids and the base.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So when they're mixed, they should neutralize each other.

I think the first thing I need to do is find out the moles of H+ ions from the acids and the moles of OH- ions from the base. Then, see which is the limiting reactant.

Let me calculate moles for each.

Starting with HCl: HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

Molarity (M) = moles / liters, so moles = M * volume (in liters).

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

Next, H2SO4: it's a strong acid too, and it's diprotic. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

So moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each of those gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now for the base, Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- ions are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So the total H+ is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles.

So which one is the limiting reagent? The OH- is less, so it will be the limiting reactant. That means all the OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

The reaction is: H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So moles of H+ reacting: 0.2 moles.

So the moles of H+ remaining unreacted: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

But wait, wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so when it reacts with a base, each mole can provide two H+ ions. But in this case, the OH
