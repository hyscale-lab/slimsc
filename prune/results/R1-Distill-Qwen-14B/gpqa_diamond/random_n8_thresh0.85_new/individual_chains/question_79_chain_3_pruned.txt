Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying compound X based on the NMR data of its reaction product. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Oh right, that's the one. Sharpless epoxidation is used to form epoxides from epoxide precursors, like diols or certain dienol ethers. Or wait, no, I think it's for epoxidizing alkenes. Oh right, the Sharpless epoxidation specifically targets epoxidation of epoxides from epoxide precursors, maybe. Or wait, no, the Sharpless is for epoxidation of allylic alcohols. Let me think. Oh yeah, Sharpless epoxidation converts epoxide precursors (like diols or certain alkenes with adjacent alcohols) into epoxides. Or wait, no, the Sharpless epoxidation is for epoxidation of allylic alcohols, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors. So if compound X reacts under Sharpless conditions, it's likely an epoxide.

Wait, but looking at the possible options, all of them seem to be epoxides. Let me check the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane.

C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane.

D) 2-styrylepoxide.

Wait, oxirane is another name for epoxide. So all options are epoxides, or at least have an epoxide ring. So perhaps the reaction is performing some kind of transformation on the epoxide, but the product's NMR is given.

Wait, the question says the experiment is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is the catalyst in Sharpless epoxidation. So that suggests that compound X is undergoing epoxidation. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the Sharpless epoxidation is used to make epoxides from specific dienol ethers. So if we have compound X being treated with this reagent, which is a catalyst for epoxidation, then perhaps X is an alkene that's being epoxidized.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the product is an epoxide. So the product would have an epoxide group. Let me think about the product's NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

δ 2.28 (3H, s): a singlet, probably a CH3 group attached to something that doesn't split the signal, maybe an electronegative atom or in a symmetric environment.

δ 2.31 (3H, s): another singlet, same as above.

Then we have some aromatic protons. Let's see:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Hmm, that's a pattern that might suggest a para-substituted benzene ring, perhaps. Because the doublets could be from ortho, meta, and para positions. Wait, let me think. Maybe two sets of doublets with two protons each and one each.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Let me draw that. So if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and so would 3 and 5. So the NMR would show two doublets each integrating to 2H, and one singlet for the para position? Wait, no, but the data has two double
