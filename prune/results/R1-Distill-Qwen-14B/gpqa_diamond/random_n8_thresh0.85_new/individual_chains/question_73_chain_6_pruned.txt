Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because that doesn't account for relativistic effects. So I need to use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, right? Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but relative to what? I think the problem is asking for the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. Oh, or maybe it's the speed one would measure relative to the other? I'm a bit confused about that part. No, wait, the question says "relative speed." So I guess it's the speed of one astronaut as observed from the other's frame.

I remember that the formula for adding velocities in special relativity isn't just v1 - v2. Instead, there's a specific formula to calculate the relative velocity. Let me recall that formula. Oh right! The relative velocity u' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the frame itself.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Suppose in the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at velocity v, and astronaut B is moving at velocity u. But wait, in this problem, both are moving in the same direction, right? So I need to find the velocity of B as seen from A's frame, or vice versa. Let me think about the correct setup.

Wait, no, perhaps I should pick a reference frame. Let me consider the frame of astronaut A, who's moving at 0.6c. Then, the speed of astronaut B in this frame would be the relative speed. So in A's frame, the speed of B is (v_B - v_A) divided by (1 - (v_A v_B)/c²). Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of the object in the lab frame (B's velocity), and v is the velocity of the moving frame (A's velocity). So that makes sense.

So let's compute
