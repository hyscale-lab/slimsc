Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question involves several reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on my adamantane structures, but I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure with multiple fused cyclohexane rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead positions.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, maybe an E2 mechanism. When vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases, they typically eliminate to form alkenes. So if we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps the bromines are on adjacent carbons, but wait, wait. Wait, in adamantane, the positions are bridgehead carbons. So 1 and 3 are across from each other? Or adjacent? Hmm... Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on carbons that are each attached to two other bridgeheads. Wait, perhaps when KOH is used, it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination and forming a double bond. But in adamantane, each bridgehead is a CH2 group typically. Wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid structure where each bridgehead is a CH with two adjacent rings. So each bridgehead carbon is probably a CH2 because each bridgehead in adamantane is connected to two other bridgeheads.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused in a particular way. Each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three other carbons. So each bridgehead is a CH group (like a tertiary carbon). So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on two bridgehead carbons that are across from each other? Or perhaps adjacent? Hmm, I'm a bit confused there. Maybe it's not so important for the first step.

So when heated with KOH, it's an elimination reaction. So two Br's are eliminated, and we get an alkene. But wait, elimination of two bromides would form a double bond between the two bridgeheads. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate to form 1,3-didehydroadamantane, which would be an alkene. Wait, but that would make a structure with a double bond between the two bridgeheads. Alternatively, maybe it's more about dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but in any case, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, which fits with the formation of an alkene. Also, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Hmm, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait, but if we have elimination, that would form an alkene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening elimination. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an intramolecular elimination. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe each Br is on a
