--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm looking at this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each part carefully.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which ones exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each a combination of these four.

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it could be due to other forms of asymmetry like allenes or certain ring structures, but I think for this question, focusing on chiral centers is sufficient.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**

Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize this structure. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, so that's two carboxylate groups (since it's a dicarboxylate). Also, there are nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' on each ring.

The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions. So, for each benzene ring, what's the symmetry? Let me think about the molecule. The two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1', so it's 1,1'-biphenyl. Now, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, in a benzene ring, the substituents at 2 and 6 positions are in positions that are across from each other if the ring is numbered clockwise. So, the 2 and 6 positions are para to each other. So each ring has a carboxylate group (O-CO-OCH3) at position 2 and a nitro group at position 6.

Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 2' for the carboxylate, and 6 and 6' for nitro. So each ring has a COOCH3 and a NO2 group on opposite sides.

Wait, but the molecule is dimethyl, so each of the two carboxylate groups is connected to a methyl group (O-CO-OCH3). 

Now, does this structure have a plane of symmetry? If both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, then the entire molecule might be symmetrical. Let me think. The two rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So the structure is symmetric across the central bond between the two rings. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound? Or perhaps it's not chiral because of this symmetry.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So any chiral centers would be opposite each other, making the molecule achiral. But wait, does this compound have any chiral centers?

Wait, the substituents are on the benzene rings. Benzene itself is planar and sp² hybridized. The substituents attached to the benzene might create chiral centers elsewhere? Or wait, are the substituents such that the connecting point has four different groups attached?

Wait, the central bond is between two benzene rings. Each ring has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions, but I'm not sure if that's where the chiral centers are. Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon (if any) is a point for chirality. Oh wait, wait. Wait, biphenyl systems are connected by a single bond, but the carbons in the biphenyl are in the benzene rings. So the central bond is between two carbons that are each part of a benzene ring. So, are any of those carbons chiral?

In a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the ring and one substituent (like COOCH3 or NO2) and a hydrogen. So each ring's substituent is at position 2, and the other substituent at 6. So each substituent is at a position that's across from each other on the ring.

Wait, but in biphenyl, the two rings are connected by a sigma bond. So the substituents on each ring could be in positions that create a chiral center in the connecting region. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making any potential chiral centers cancel out.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each benzene ring are such that when looking at the entire molecule, it's symmetrical, making it a meso compound. So maybe this structure doesn't show optical isomerism because of symmetry.

I'm a bit confused here, but I'll tentatively say that this compound (1) might not exhibit optical isomerism, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should come back to this.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**

Breaking this down: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. But wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with the hydroxy on the second carbon.

Wait, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)(OH)CH3. Let me write it out: the carbon chain is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3. So the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3,
- and another CH3.

Wait, that's four groups. So the central carbon is attached to two methyl groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. Wait, but two methyl groups are the same. So the groups are: CH3, CH3, OH, COOCH3. So two of the substituents are the same (CH3), so the central carbon is not a chiral center. Because a chiral center must have four different groups attached.

Oh wait, wait. Because the two CH3 groups are identical, the central carbon doesn't have four different substituents. So there's no chiral center here. Therefore, this compound (2) cannot have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm making a mistake. The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but when it's 2-hydroxy, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Hmm, wait no. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)C(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, let me re-examine.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, for structure: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be: CH2CH2COO-OCH3. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate.

So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- (where the COO- is on the third carbon). So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate chain. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH2OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, no, the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)- 
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, wait, no. Let me number the propionoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester is CH2CH2COO-OCH3. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is the middle carbon.

So the structure is (CH2OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3?

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be methyl propionate: CH2CH2COOCH3. So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxy is on the second carbon of the propanoate chain.

So the structure is: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- One CH2OH group,
- Two CH2 groups (left and right),
- And a COOCH3 group.

Wait, no. Let me outline the structure:

The propanoate chain in the ester is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but that's not correct because propanoate is three carbons. Wait, maybe it's:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH) connected to CH2 connected to COOCH3, making the chain -CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, the middle carbon (CH2) is connected to two CH2 groups (the OH is on the first CH2, right? No, wait, the first is CH2OH, the second is CH2, then the COOCH3. So the middle carbon is attached to:

- one CH2OH,
- one CH2,
- two H's?

Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3. So that's 2-hydroxypropanoate as (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as the structure (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3.

So in that case, the central carbon (the C with the OH) is attached to:

- two CH3 groups,
- an OH,
- a COOCH3 group.

Wait, so the substituents are two CH3, one OH, one COOCH3. Since two substituents are the same (CH3), the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here. So compound (2) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the OH is on a different carbon. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a chiral center. Hmm, maybe I should make a drawing.

But given that I can't draw, I'll proceed with the analysis. If the central carbon has two identical groups (like two CH3), then it's not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism for compound (2).

3. **Benzophenone**

Benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, where Ph is phenyl. So the structure is two benzene rings connected to a central ketone group (C=O). The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, two oxygen atoms (one double-bonded as a ketone, and another as part of the carbonyl, but wait, no. Actually, the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and another single-bonded oxygen? No, wait, no. Benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, which is phenyl groups on either side of a carbonyl group.

So the central carbon is connected to:

- Two phenyl groups,
- One carbonyl oxygen (double bond),
- and one single-bonded oxygen (from the ketone, but wait, no, the carbonyl is O. So the structure is:

O
||
C(Ph)₂

Wait, no. The structure is (Ph)₂C=O. So the central carbon is double-bonded to an oxygen, and single-bonded to two phenyl groups. So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, a carbonyl oxygen (double bond), and another single bond (the other bond is the double bond, so in reality, the central carbon has three bonds: two to phenyl and one double bond to O, but wait, that's only three bonds. Wait, no, the carbonyl is a double bond so the central C is connected to two Ph groups and a double-bonded O. So that leaves only three bonds, but carbons have four. Oh right, wait, the central C is connected to two Ph groups, one O (double bond), and another H. Wait, no, benzophenone is (Ph)₂CO, which is (Ph)₂C=O, which implies that the central C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Ph groups. So that's three groups. Wait, that can't be right because carbon must have four bonds. Oh wait, no. The structure is actually Ph–CO–Ph, but with both Ph groups attached to the same C, which is double-bonded to O. So that C has two Ph, one O (double bond), and another single bond? No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph–C(Ph)=O

Wait, no. Benzophenone's structure is two benzene rings connected to a ketone group. So it's (Ph)₂CO, which is (Ph)₂C=O. So the carbonyl group is in the center. So the central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and a double-bonded oxygen, but that's only three substituents. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, perhaps the central carbon is connected to three Ph groups and an O? No, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as: the benzophenone molecule is (Ph)₂CO, so the structure is Ph-C-O-Ph, but that's not correct. Wait, no, the correct structure is (Ph)₂CO, which is Ph–C(=O)–Ph. So the central carbon is connected to two Ph groups and the double-bonded O. Since carbon can't have only three bonds, wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again: The carbonyl group is C=O, so the carbon is double-bonded to O and has two single bonds to the two Ph groups. So the central C has two Ph groups, one O (double bond), and another single bond, which can't be possible because that would require four bonds. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think: the formula for benzophenone is C13H10O. So the structure is two benzene rings (C6H5) connected to a ketone group (CO). So the structure is (C6H5)₂CO. So the central C is part of the ketone group: C=O, and it's connected to two C6H5 groups.

So the central C is bonded to two C6H5, one O (double bond), and another H? Wait, no, because the structure is (Ph)₂CO, which would imply that the central C is bonded to two Ph groups and a carbonyl O, but how?

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the central C is double-bonded to O, and single-bonded to two Ph groups. That's three bonds. But carbon has four valence bonds. Oh! Wait, wait a second. No. The structure is:

Ph–C(O)–Ph

But that's not correct. Benzophenone's structure is two phenyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. So the correct structure is (Ph)₂CO, which implies that the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen. But that can't be because the carbonyl is a double bond. So perhaps the correct structure is Ph–CO–Ph, which means the central C is part of the carbonyl group. So the central C is connected to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to O. But that leaves only three bonds, which isn't possible. I must be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph–C–O–Ph, but that would not be a ketone but an ether. No, so I must be making a mistake in understanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to accept that benzophenone has a central ketone group, so the structure is (Ph)₂CO, which implies that the central C is connected to two Ph groups and an O via a double bond. So the C has three substituents: two Ph and one O. But that's only three bonds. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the central C is part of the carbonyl group, so it's double-bonded to O and connected to two Ph groups. So, the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

Which would mean that the central C has three substituents: two Ph and one O (double bond). But that can't be because carbon can't have only three bonds. So I'm getting stuck on the structure here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Ph)₂C=O, which is possible. So the central C is bonded to two Ph groups and a double-bonded O, but that leaves only three substituents. Wait, no, I'm missing something. Oh wait, the central C is like:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph

So the C has two Ph groups, one O (double bond), and another single bond to what? Wait, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't (Ph)₂CO but something else, but I'm stuck. Maybe it's better to move on and come back.

Assuming the structure is Ph–CO–Ph, but the central C is double-bonded to O and connected to two Ph groups. Then, is this molecule chiral?

Well, the central C is connected to two identical groups (Ph), a double-bonded O, and perhaps another substituent. Wait, but if both substituents are Ph, then the central C has two identical Ph groups and an O. But that's only three substituents; perhaps there's a fourth. Wait, no, the structure isn't making sense to me. Maybe benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers because it's symmetrical. So, no optical isomerism here. So, compound (3) doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl fumarate**

Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumarate is the ester form. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid with methanol. Fumarate has a structure where the two double bonds are in a trans configuration.

Wait, fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond between the two central carbons, and the substituents on either side are in trans configuration. So the structure of fumarate would be:

O
||
O=C–C=C–COO-
||
O

But wait, more accurately, fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

The dimethyl ester would replace the -OH of each COOH with OMe groups. So the structure would be:

O
||
O=C–C(=O)OCH3
    |
    C=C
    |
O=C–C(=O)OCH3
    |
O
||

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, but with the double bond between the two CH groups. The structure is HO₂C–CH=CH–CO₂H. The E configuration (fumarate) has the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate would be (E)-CH₂COOCH3. Hmm, wait, no. Let me think again. Fumarate's structure is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of each COOH with OMe.

So the structure would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So each ester is on the same side of the double bond?

Wait, no. Because in fumarate, the two COOH groups are trans, so the ester groups would also be trans. So the structure is:

MeOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO Me? No, because it's a double bond. So it's MeOOC–CH=CH–COO Me, with the ester groups on opposite sides.

Wait, but in terms of stereoisomerism, fumarate itself is a trans diastereomer of maleic acid, which is cis. So dimethyl fumarate would have the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So, looking at the molecule, the two ester groups (OCH3) are on opposite sides. Now, does this create a chiral center?

Wait, in this structure, each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) are connected to two ester groups, a double bond, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, wait. Let's look at the structure.

MeOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO Me. No, no, it's a double bond. So, the structure is MeOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO Me isn't correct because there's a double bond. It's MeOOC–CH=CH–COO Me. So the two middle carbons are each bonded to an OMe group, a COOCH3 group, and another group.

Wait, each of the two central carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One OCH3 group,
- And two other substituents (like H and maybe another group).

Wait, no, the structure is CH₂ groups on either side of the double bond. For fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides. So the two ester groups (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chirality, which requires a chiral center. Does this structure have any chiral centers?

Looking at each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond), each is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One OCH3 group,
- Two other substituents (like H or CH2 groups).

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure again. For dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
     \
C=C
     /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But that's a rough representation. Each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is connected to:

- One OCOOCH3 group,
- One OCH3 group,
- Two other substituents, which are likely to be CH2 groups or something else.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons is connected to two OCOOCH3 groups and two other groups. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, each CH in the double bond is connected to an OCOOCH3 group and a hydrogen, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I should consider the structure as:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme with a double bond between the CH2 groups. Wait, no, that's maleate. Fumarate has the double bond in a trans configuration.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the possibility of any chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate. Since the molecule has a double bond, can it have E/Z isomerism? Yes, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality, i.e., the presence of a chiral center. So whether the molecule has any carbon atoms attached to four different groups.

Looking at the two central carbons in the double bond, each is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One OCH3 group,
- Two other groups, perhaps H and another group.

Wait, no, each would be connected to two identical groups if it's a symmetrical structure.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two middle carbons is attached to:

- OCOOCH3,
- OCH3,
- and two CH2 groups?

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two middle carbons is attached to:

- OCOOCH3,
- OCH3,
- and two CH3 groups? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, I can think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, it can't be chiral. So dimethyl fumarate has the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond, which could make it asymmetrical.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. For example, in the case of meso compounds, like tartaric acid. But in the case of fumarate, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

In dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. Because for each substituent on one side, there's an identical substituent on the other. So the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Wait, but wait, that would imply that it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical because the substituents on each end are identical, but the arrangement around the double bond creates asymmetry elsewhere. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: Does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Because if it does, it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at each of the two central carbons (in the double bond), each is connected to an OCOOCH3 group, an OCH3 group, and two other substituents. But wait, in the structure of fumarate, each of the two middle carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group, a CH2 group, and a hydrogen? Or perhaps another arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 — C — C — O-C-OCH3
        |    |
        C    C
        ||

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps each of the two central carbons is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One OCH3 group,
- a double bond to the other central carbon,
- and a hydrogen or another substituent.

Wait, but in that case, each central carbon would have four different substituents, making them chiral centers.

Wait, if that's the case, then the molecule would have two chiral centers, leading to optical isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate would exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the two chiral centers are mirror images, leading to an overall achiral molecule. Like in meso compounds.

Wait, in the case of fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, for each of the two central carbons, the substituents would be:

For the first carbon: COOCH3, OCH3, a double bond to the second carbon, and a hydrogen.

For the second carbon: COOCH3, OCH3, a double bond to the first carbon, and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would imply that each carbon has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. So each would be a chiral center, but because they are mirror images due to the symmetry, the molecule could be a meso compound, making it achiral overall.

Wait, for example, tartaric acid is a meso compound because the two chiral centers are mirror images, leading to an overall achiral molecule. So if dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, in fumarate, the substituents are in a trans configuration. So the two central carbons would each have four different substituents, but their configurations would be opposite, leading to a meso compound.

Hmm, that would mean that the molecule doesn't have optical isomerism because it's a meso form. So dimethyl fumarate would not show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if the molecule isn't a meso compound, then it would have optical isomerism. But I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think again: if a compound has two chiral centers that are mirror images, making the molecule achiral overall, then it's a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in the case of dimethyl fumarate, the two central carbons have the same substituents arranged symmetrically. Therefore, the molecule is a meso compound and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. Fumarate is (E), which is the trans isomer. The dimethyl ester would also be trans. The structure would be:

MeOOC–CH₂–CH₂–COO Me with a double bond. No, wait, no. The structure is CH₂ groups with a double bond between them.

Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH in the trans configuration. The ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COO Me.

So each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) would have:

- One MeOOC group,
- One COO Me group,
- A hydrogen,
- and a double bond to the other carbon.

Wait, but each of those carbons would have four substituents, but two of them are identical (MeOOC and COO Me are on opposite sides). So each central carbon is attached to:

- MeOOC,
- COO Me,
- a hydrogen,
- and the double bond.

Wait, but in that case, each central C would have four different substituents, making them chiral centers. However, because the substituents are arranged in a symmetrical way (trans), the two chiral centers would be mirror images of each other, leading to a meso compound. So the molecule would not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is this a common example of a diastereomer? Hmm. Maybe I'm confusing fumarate and maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer, and fumarate is the trans. So, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Therefore, compound (4) wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about this.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me recap each compound.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Symmetry: The substituents on each ring are at para positions. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the central bond. So any potential chiral centers would be mirrored, making it a meso compound and not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3. The central carbon has two CH3, one OH, one COOCH3. So two substituents are the same, so no chiral center. No optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone.

Structure: (Ph)₂CO. The central carbon is connected to two Ph groups and a carbonyl O, but due to the symmetry, no chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate.

Structure: MeOOC-CH=CH-COO Me (trans configuration). The two central carbons are each connected to MeOOC, COO Me, and two other substituents. Due to the trans configuration, each is a chiral center, but they are mirror images, making the molecule a meso compound. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting ideas here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound (4). Maybe it's not a meso compound. Because in the case of fumarate, the two substituents are on opposite sides, so the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So each chiral center is present, and the molecule as a whole is chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's a meso compound. So if the two substituents on either side are mirror images, then it's meso. For dimethyl fumarate, with the two ester groups on opposite sides, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Hmm. Imagine looking at the molecule along the double bond axis. If the ester groups are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For example, if you have MeOOC on the top of the left carbon and COO Me on the bottom of the right carbon, and vice versa, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center of the double bond. So, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral.

So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused now. I think I need to find another approach. Let me think of each structure's possibility of having a chiral center.

1. Compound (1): Any chiral centers? The substituents are on each ring, but the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. So no chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

2. Compound (2): No chiral center because two substituents are same. No optical isomerism.

3. Compound (3): No chiral centers due to symmetry. No optical isomerism.

4. Compound (4): If the structure is such that each central C is a chiral center, but the molecule is a meso compound, then no optical isomerism. Otherwise, yes.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about (4).

Wait, perhaps I should think of dimethyl fumarate as having E geometry, which is trans. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So each of the two central carbons is connected to:

- MeOOC,
- COO Me,
- a hydrogen,
- and the double bond.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then both central carbons are mirror images, making the molecule a meso compound. So no optical isomerism.

But wait, in reality, fumarate is a trans-diepoxy structure, and its ester would have the two ester groups on opposite sides. So the molecule would be symmetrical, leading to a meso form. Hence, no optical isomerism.

So, all four compounds don't exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not possible because the options don't include an option where none is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps compound (1) actually has a chiral center. Let me think again.

Compound (1): dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is biphenyl with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6.

Wait, but the biphenyl's structure is such that the two rings are connected at position 1 and 1'. So each ring has substituents at 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2).

Now, in the biphenyl structure, the substituents at 2 and 6 are on the same ring. So each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6, which are para to each other.

So the molecule has two such rings connected via a single bond. Now, is there any possibility of a chiral center in this structure?

Wait, the biphenyl structure itself doesn't have any chiral centers because the central bond is between two carbons that are part of aromatic rings. So, the substituents are on the aromatic rings, which are planar and sp² hybridized. So, no chiral centers in the rings.

But perhaps the molecule as a whole is chiral. For instance, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. But in this case, with the substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe it's better to think about actual examples. I remember that biphenyl compounds can exhibit optical isomerism if the substituents create a chiral axis.

Wait, wait. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. If it doesn't, then it is chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has the same substituents (COOCH3 and NO2) in para positions. The two rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions, so the substituents would be arranged symmetrically. Thus, the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound. So, no optical isomerism.

So, none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But that can't be right because the options don't include an option where none are correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound (4). Let me think again about dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-diepoxy. So the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COO Me, with the ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So each of the two central carbons is attached to:

- One COO Me group,
- One OMe group,
- A hydrogen,
- And a double bond to the other carbon.

Wait, but in the (E) configuration, the substituents (COO Me and OMe) are on opposite sides. So each central carbon has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. But because the molecule is symmetric, the two chiral centers are mirror images, making the molecule a meso compound and thus achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, but if that's the case, then none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism, which isn't an option in the given choices. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in evaluating one of the compounds.

Let me go back to compound (2): methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3.

So the central carbon is connected to:

- Two CH3 groups,
- One OH,
- One COOCH3.

So the four substituents are: CH3, CH3, OH, COOCH3.

Wait, two substituents are the same (CH3), so the central carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So I'm back to the conclusion that none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But that's not possible because the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound (4). Let me think: dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, not a single bond. So the two central carbons can rotate? No, because they're part of a double bond, so they can't rotate. So the substituents are fixed.

Wait, if the molecule has two chiral centers that are not mirror images, then the molecule is chiral. But in the case of (E) fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, leading to each chiral center being a mirror image of the other, making the molecule meso.

So, considering all that, perhaps the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is none of them. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm wrong in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound (4). Let's think again: dimethyl fumarate's structure has the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So each of the two central carbons has four different substituents: MeOOC, COO Me, a hydrogen, and a double bond (which is considered a substituent here? Or is it just part of the structure?).

Wait, the double bond is between the two carbons, so each carbon is connected via a double bond to the other. Therefore, each central carbon's substituents are:

- MeOOC,
- COO Me,
- a hydrogen,
- and two substituents from the double bond (which is a single substituent, the double bond itself).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps each central carbon is connected to three substituents: MeOOC, COO Me, and a hydrogen, plus the double bond. So four substituents in total: two groups (MeOOC and COO Me), a hydrogen, and the double bond (which is a substituent with two bonds). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps each central carbon is attached to:

- MeOOC,
- COO Me,
- a hydrogen,
- and a single bond to the other central carbon.

Wait, but the double bond means that each carbon is double-bonded to the other, so each can't have a single bond. So perhaps each has three substituents: MeOOC, COO Me, and a hydrogen, plus the double bond.

Wait, but that would mean each has three substituents, which isn't possible because carbon has four valence bonds. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each central carbon is connected to MeOOC, COO Me, a hydrogen, and another substituent.

Wait, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should think of another approach.

Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2, 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

If none of the compounds exhibit optical isomerism, then the correct answer isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.

Wait, perhaps compound (4) does show optical isomerism because it's not a meso compound. Let me imagine the structure of dimethyl fumarate. It's (E)-diepoxy. Imagine looking at the molecule from the top: the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the central bond. Therefore, it's a meso compound, and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, none of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in compound (2). Let me reevaluate compound (2): methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is CH3-C(OH)(COOCH3)-CH3. So the central carbon is connected to two CH3 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3. Therefore, two substituents are identical, so no chiral center. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think that perhaps one of the compounds does exhibit optical isomerism. Let me go back to the options.

Option A says 1, 2, 4.

Option D says 1 and 2.

Option B says 3 and 4.

Option C says 2 and 3.

If I think that only compound (4) exhibits optical isomerism, then looking at the options, option A includes 4, but also 1 and 2, which I don't think do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound (1).

Compound (1): dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are para positions. So each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So the molecule has two rings connected at 1 and 1', each with substituents at 2 and 6. Now, if these substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are positioned in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. Because 6,6' are para to 2,2' on each ring, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates chirality.

Wait, but if the substituents are symmetrical across the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. For instance, if on each ring, the COOCH3 is at 2 and the NO2 at 6, directly across from each other, then the molecule would be symmetrical, making it a meso compound.

But wait, perhaps the substituents are not in para positions. Let me think again. 1,1'-biphenyl means the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, 2 is ortho to the connecting bond.

Wait, in biphenyl, position 2 on one ring is adjacent (ortho) to the connecting position (1). So, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are meta to the connecting position.

Wait, no. Let me imagine a biphenyl structure. The first ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are adjacent to the connecting position (1) and opposite to each other. So, each ring has substituents at their 2 and 6 positions.

But in this case, the substituents on each ring are in para positions relative to each other, but their position relative to the connecting bond is ortho and para.

Wait, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry because the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the overall molecule isn't symmetrical. For example, the COOCH3 on one ring's 2 position and the NO2 on the same ring's 6 position could be arranged in such a way that the molecule is chiral.

But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere, like in the ester groups. But the ester groups are attached to the benzene rings, which are sp² hybridized, so they can't be chiral centers.

So, perhaps compound (1) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm.

At this point, since I'm taking too long and not making progress, perhaps I should make an educated guess. Given the options, and considering that dimethyl fumarate (4) is a trans diastereomer, which can have E/Z isomerism but not necessarily optical isomerism.

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chirality. So, if the molecule has a chiral center, it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, going back to compound (4): dimethyl fumarate. If the two central carbons are chiral centers and the molecule isn't a meso compound, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, in fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, so perhaps the molecule isn't a meso compound, making the two chiral centers result in a chiral molecule.

In that case, dimethyl fumarate would exhibit optical isomerism.

Then, looking at the options, the correct answer would include compound (4). Looking at the options:

Option A: 1, 2,4 → but I don't think 1 and 2 are correct.

Option B: 3 and4 → I don't think 3 is correct.

Option D: 1 and 2 → no.

Option A includes 4, but I'm not sure about 1 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps only compound (4) exhibits optical isomerism, but none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound (2). Let me think again: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon is attached to two CH3, an OH, and a COOCH3. So two substituents are same, making it not a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

Hmm.

I think I've spent too much time and need to make a decision. Based on my analysis, the only compound that might exhibit optical isomerism is dimethyl fumarate (4), but I'm not entirely sure. Looking at the options, option A includes 4, but I don't think 1 and 2 are correct. Option A says 1, 2, and 4. But earlier analysis says none of them except maybe 4. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound (1). Let me think again: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other, and the two rings are connected in a symmetrical way, then the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound. So no optical isomerism.

So, only compound (4) exhibits optical isomerism, but the options don't have an option where only (4) is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound (2). Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: perhaps the structure isn't (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, but rather CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. In that case, the central carbon would be attached to:

- CH3,
- CH2COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3.

Wait, no, that would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the CH(OH) group. So substituents are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong again. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group (from CH(OH)).

Wait, no, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is the CH(OH) group.

So, substituents on the central carbon (the one with OH) are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group (from where? No, perhaps it's the CH2 attached to the next carbon).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that can't be because the formula is 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is three carbons. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group (but that doesn't make sense because the chain is only three carbons.

 Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In that case, the central carbon is the CH2 in the middle, attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups.

Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, making the middle CH2 a carbon with two CH2 groups, an OH, and a COOCH3.

So, substituents are:

- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (left and right),
- and OH.

So, the substituents are: CH2COOCH3, CH2CH3 (if the chain is longer?), but no, I'm getting myself confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, making the central carbon (CH(OH)) have substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH. Wait, but that would make four different groups, making it a chiral center.

Wait, that changes everything. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, no, because the adjacent carbon is CH3. So the substituents would be:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon has four different groups, making it a chiral center.

If that's the case, compound (2) would exhibit optical isomerism.

But earlier I thought that because two substituents were the same (two CH3), the central carbon wasn't a chiral center. But if the structure is different, perhaps it is.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. Let me number the propanoate chain as:

1: CH3-
2: CH(OH)-
3: COOCH3

So, the central carbon (2) is connected to:

- CH3 (from carbon 1),
- COOCH3 (from carbon 3),
- OH,
- and another CH2 group (from carbon 3? No, because it's a chain, carbon 3 is the end of the chain).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH attached to carbon 2,
- and another substituent, which is a single bond to carbon 3.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because that would make four different groups, leading to a chiral center. So, in that case, compound (2) would exhibit optical isomerism.

But earlier I thought the structure was (CH3)2C(OH)COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center. So perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, the correct structure for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. In this structure, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, but the adjacent carbon is CH3. So substituents are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and a single bond to another CH3.

Wait, that would mean that the central carbon has:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and a single bond to another CH3.

So, substituents would be:

- Two CH3 groups (from carbon 1 and the adjacent carbon),
- OH,
- COOCH3.

So, two substituents are same, making the central carbon not a chiral center.

Hmm. I'm so stuck. I think I have to make a decision based on my analysis.

In summary:

- Compound (1): No optical isomerism.
- Compound (2): No optical isomerism.
- Compound (3): No optical isomerism.
- Compound (4): No optical isomerism.

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in compound (4), and it does exhibit optical isomerism.

Given that, the correct answer might be option A, which includes 4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in compound (4). If the structure isn't a meso compound, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. So option A includes 4, but I'm not sure about 1 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer is option A.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or other forms of asymmetry that lead to chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chirality, which typically arises from a carbon atom (or another element) bonded to four different groups.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at positions 1 and 1', with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents are a carboxylate group (COOCH₃) at position 2 and a nitro group (NO₂) at position 6 on each ring. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents on both rings and the plane of symmetry along the central bond. This symmetry makes the compound a meso compound, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to the following groups:  
   - CH₃ (from C1),  
   - COOCH₃ (from C3),  
   - OH,  
   - and a hydrogen (H).  
   Since the central carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon in the carbonyl group is bonded to two identical phenyl groups and the oxygen atom. This symmetry means there are no chiral centers, and the compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the ester form of fumaric acid, with the structure MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe in the (E) configuration. The two central carbons in the double bond are each bonded to:  
   - MeOOC,  
   - COOCH₃,  
   - a hydrogen (H),  
   - and the double bond.  
   Each central carbon is a chiral center. However, due to the trans configuration, the two chiral centers are mirror images of each other, making the molecule a meso compound. As a result, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1: No optical isomerism (meso compound).  
- Compound 2: Exhibits optical isomerism (chiral center).  
- Compound 3: No optical isomerism (symmetry).  
- Compound 4: No optical isomerism (meso compound).  

The only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (Compound 2)**. However, none of the provided options include only Compound 2. Based on the analysis, **Option A (1, 2, and 4)** is the closest match, despite the earlier conclusion that Compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.

ANSWER: A
