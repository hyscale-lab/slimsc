Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, something like that.

Wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. So the number of stars depends on the volume of space at a certain distance. Since in 3D space, the volume increases with the cube of the radius. But how does that tie into parallax?

Let me think. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx. 

If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars (number per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be proportional to the surface area of that shell multiplied by the thickness, right? Because it's a thin shell, the volume is approximately 4πd² * dr, where dr is the thickness.

But since we're looking at how the number per unit parallax range changes, maybe I should express everything in terms of parallax. Let's let plx = p. Then d = 1/p. So the volume element in terms of p would change.

Wait, I need to find the number of stars per unit range of p. Let's say we have a small change in p, dp. How does that relate to the change in distance?

The distance d = 1/p → so if p increases by dp, d changes by dd. Let's compute dd in terms of dp. Since d = (1/p), dd/dp = -1/p² → so dp = -p² dd. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, maybe I can ignore the sign and focus on the magnitude.

So the volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. But in terms of p, that's 4π (1/p)² (dp / p²) )? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. So the volume element dV is 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ) → but the negative just flips the sign, so dV = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The volume element in terms of p would be 4π (d)^2 * dd, but since dd is expressed in terms of dp, we substitute:

d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp → so dV = 4π (1/p)^2 * ( -1/p² dp ) → the negative just indicates direction, so the volume is positive and is (4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) ) dp → so 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But the number of stars in that volume would be proportional to the volume, since the density is uniform. So number of stars N = n * dV,
