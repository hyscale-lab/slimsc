Okay, so I need to figure out which reaction sequence will give me 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, this is a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with multiple substituents on benzene, the order of reactions matters a lot because each substituent directs the next substitution. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming groups to certain positions. 

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let me note their positions. The numbering is such that the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, the substituents are meta to each other? Or wait, let me visualize the benzene ring. If the ethoxy is at position 1, then going around: position 2 would be meta to position 1, but wait, wait. Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions more clearly.

Wait, the structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,3. Wait, that's a bit unusual because adjacent positions. Hmm, but that's possible.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I got the numbering wrong. Oh, no, in benzene numbering, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest numbers possible. So, the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. So all three substituents are adjacent, which is a bit tricky because each substitution will affect the next.

Now, the key is to plan the order of substituents so that each new group is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects.

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH2CH3) is an activating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an electron-donating group (since it's an ether).
- Nitro group (-NO2) is a deactivating, meta-directing group because it's an electron-withdrawing group.
- tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) is a strongly activating, because it's an alkyl group. It's a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group.

Wait, but wait: the nitro group is meta-directing, while tert-butyl is ortho/para. The ethoxy is also ortho/para. Hmm.

Now, I need to plan the order of adding substituents. Let's consider the steps required.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So, we'll have to perform three substitution reactions.

So which groups should be added first, second, and third?

We should consider the order that allows each new substituent to be added in the correct position, considering the directing effects.

Wait, but sometimes, if a group is added that is strongly activating, it
