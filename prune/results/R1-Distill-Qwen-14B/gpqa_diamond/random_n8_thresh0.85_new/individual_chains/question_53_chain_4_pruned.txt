Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me break down the information given.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? Because it's a 6-membered aromatic ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, so there's an ester functional group present. Esters have the carbonyl group (C=O), which typically shows a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹. So that's a clue.

Looking at the ¹H NMR data: six signals. Let me see what each part means. Two signals for aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern must influence the splitting. For a di-substituted benzene, the ring protons can be either ortho, meta, or para. But if it's para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet. Wait, but the NMR shows two aromatic signals. So maybe it's ortho substitution, which would give two sets of two protons each, but maybe as a triplet or doublet. Alternatively, if it's para substitution, you'd have two sets of two equivalent protons each, which would be two signals. So that fits the NMR data.

Next, two signals for vinyl protons. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are in a double bond, like an alkene. So perhaps it's part of an ester group? Esters have an alkyl group attached to the oxygen, but maybe the structure has a vinyl group attached to something else. Wait, the ester group is O-C-O, connected to an R group. So maybe the ester is part of a substituent on the benzene ring. Let me think: if the substituent is something like a vinyl ester, like O-CO-O-R with a double bond, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenoate ester or something similar.

But wait, the NMR shows two vinyl protons. So if it's an ester with a vinyl group, like maybe an allyl ester, but that would have more protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a double bond, but that's getting complicated. Let me think again about the NMR signals.

The vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. A doublet would suggest coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets might mean coupling with two protons, each with different multiplicities. Or perhaps one is next to another group that splits it into quartets. Hmm, maybe it's a part of a cyclopropane? No, that's less likely.

Wait, another thought: if the substituent is an ester group attached to a benzene ring, perhaps it's a substituted phenyl group linked via an ester. For example, something like O-CO-O-R, but R might have some vinyl groups. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH₂CH₂COO-... No, that doesn't have vinyl. Or perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group, like CH₂=CHCOOR. Wait, but that would have more protons.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with an ester substituent, and the other substituent is a vinyl group. Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. One is the ester group, and the other is a vinyl group? No, because an ester substituent is probably -O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-O-R'? Wait, no, ester is RCOOR', so attached to the benzene as O-CO-O-R? No, the ester would be as an alkoxy group attached to a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, but that's an alkoxy carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached via an oxygen, like an aryl ester.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like benzene with an ester group, say, a phenyl ester. But that might have more complex NMR signals. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, and another substituent is an ester.

Wait, but the substituents are both on the benzene ring. So the di-substituted ring has two groups: maybe one is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and the other is a vinyl group (like CH₂=CH-). Or perhaps the substituent is a group that includes both a vinyl and an ester group, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group attached to a vinyl group. For example, maybe the substituent is a -CH₂-COO-R group, but that's a single substituent. Wait, but the ring is di-substituted, so perhaps the two substituents are each on different positions. Let's think about the NMR.

The NMR has two signals for aromatic protons. So if the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet (since adjacent to substituents). So that fits: two doublets for the aromatic protons.

Then, the vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let me think about a structure that would lead to that. For example, consider a substituent like CH₂=CH-O-CO-R attached to the ring. Wait, no, that's more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH₂=CH- group attached directly to the ring. But for ester groups, maybe
