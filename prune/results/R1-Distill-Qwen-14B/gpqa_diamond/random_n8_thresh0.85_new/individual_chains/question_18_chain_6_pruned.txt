Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think the mass matters for this particular problem because the question is about elemental abundances, which are given.

The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method under LTE. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the photospheric composition of the Sun is provided as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we're looking for [nSi_1 / nSi_2], which is the ratio of Si abundance in Star_1 to that in Star_2.

Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this. I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y compared to the solar ratio.

Wait, no, more accurately, the abundance [X/Y] is defined as log10(nX/nY) − log10(nX/nY)_☉. So, for example, [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_☉. 

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So, nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as solar. Because [Fe/H]=0 → log(nFe/nH) = log_solar(nFe/nH) → same ratio.

Similarly, Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So nMg/nH in Star_2 is the same as solar.

Let me write down what I know.

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun = 10^(-4.5)

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

Wait, let's compute [Si/Fe]_1.

nSi_1 / nFe_1 = 10^{ [Si/Fe]_1 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun }

Wait, no, the formula is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) − log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 is log(nSi_1 / nFe_1) − log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) = 0.3.

Wait, but nFe_1 is known because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So the ratio nFe_1 / nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun).

Wait, but in the Sun, nH_sun is the number density of hydrogen. So if Star_1 has H abundance [H/H] = 0, which isn't stated, but perhaps the H is the same? Hmm, I think maybe the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same as the Sun's, but wait, no. Because [X/H] is the logarithm of the ratio, so if [Fe/H] is 0, that tells us about Fe relative to H. But if Star_1 has [Fe/H] =0, then nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

So, for Star_1, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH_1.

But wait, nH_1 is the number density of hydrogen in Star_1. Without knowing [H], we can't get the absolute number. But perhaps the ratio is all that's needed.

Wait, but I'm being asked for the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to that
