Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about mean free paths in a transmission electron microscope. Let me start by breaking down what the problem says.

Mike is working on a high-resolution TEM that uses a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. That's a really good vacuum, but it's not perfect because some gas particles are still present— detected by the mass spectrometer. So the initial mean free path of these gas molecules is λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions.

But when Mike turns on the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is asking why λ2 isn't the same as λ1. The temperature remains the same, so that shouldn't be the factor here.

Hmm, I remember that the mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the average speed of the gas molecules. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure.

Wait, but in this scenario, the pressure is already very low, so the mean free path λ1 is probably quite large. But when the electron beam is on, what changes? Oh, the electron beam has a high energy, so it might cause the gas molecules to ionize or maybe even get knocked out of the vacuum by the electrons. Or perhaps the electrons cause the gas to heat up, but the problem says the temperature remains the same. So probably not thermal expansion or something like that.

Another possibility is that the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to scatter more. Wait, wait—the mean free path is about how often gas molecules collide with each other. But when the electron beam is active, the electrons can interact with the gas molecules. Maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to ionize, which would mean they have more charge and might interact more with the electron beam, but how does that affect their collisions with each other?

Or maybe it's about electron scattering from the gas. The electrons in the beam are what's being scattered by the gas molecules. So when Mike turns on the electron beam, the electrons hit the gas molecules more often, so the electrons' mean free path decreases. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, wait. The mean free path here refers to the gas molecules in the vacuum. So when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are being bombarded by the electron beam, causing them to move more or perhaps changing the effective pressure in some way.

Alternatively, think about the electron beam's effect on the gas. When the electrons hit the gas molecules, they might cause them to move, effectively increasing the pressure or something. But if the pressure remains the same, then λ should stay the same. But in reality, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be removed or to have more collisions.

Wait, another angle. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the pressure. So if the pressure in the sample chamber increases, λ decreases. But in this case, the pressure was already under 1e-9 Torr.
