Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed. So that means the number of stars doesn't depend on where you look in the sky; it's the same everywhere. But how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx itself?

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Right, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, like, for a given range of parallax (say from plx to plx + dplx), how many stars are there?

Since the stars are uniform in space, the number density (stars per volume) is the same everywhere. But because the volume of space depends on the distance, the number of stars you can see in a certain parallax range depends on how much volume that parallax range corresponds to.

Let me think about this. The number of stars in a small range of parallax would depend on the volume of the spherical shell at that distance. Because as you go further, each shell has a larger radius.

So, the volume of a spherical shell between r and r + dr is 4πr² dr. Since r is the distance, and plx is 1/r, so r = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr, but wait, wait. Wait, no, because plx is 1/r, so r = 1/(plx). So dr in terms of plx would be dr = - (1/(plx²)) dplx. But maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me consider that the volume element in terms of parallax. The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) times the thickness dr. But since we're considering parallax plx, which is 1/r, let's express everything in terms of plx.

So, r = 1/plx. The volume of a thin shell at r is 4π r² dr. Let me express dr in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/r, so r = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but since plx is 1/r, as r increases, plx decreases. So when plx increases (smaller distances), r decreases.

Wait, but I'm trying to express the volume in terms of plx. So, let's substitute r = 1/plx into the volume expression. So volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. But dr is in terms of plx. So, I think I need to find how the volume element dV relates to dplx.

So, dV = 4π r² dr. But r = 1/plx, so r² = 1/plx². So, dV = 4π (1/plx²) dr. But dr in terms of dplx is dr = (dr/dplx) dplx. Let's compute dr/dplx. Since r = 1/plx, dr/dplx = -1/(plx^2). So dr = (-1/plx²) dplx. But when plx increases, r decreases, so maybe I should take the absolute value, so dV is positive.

Putting it all together:

dV = 4π (1/plx²) * ( -1/plx² dplx )

Wait, but that gives dV = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx. That's the differential volume in terms of plx. But since we're looking at the number of stars in a range of plx, the number should be proportional to the volume, right?

But wait, the number of stars in the shell would be the number density (n) times the volume. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, n is constant. So the number of stars dN in a shell is n * dV.

So, dN = n * dV = n * (-4π / plx^4) dplx. But since plx is positive and we're considering dplx as positive (a small increase in plx), the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases. But the number of stars would be proportional to the volume, which is 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Because when you have a larger plx, it's a smaller distance. So a higher plx means a closer star. But the volume of the shell also depends on how much of the distance you're covering. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit plx (dN per dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^3. Because the volume element in terms of plx would have a 1/plx^3 dependence. Let me reason this through.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume is 4π r² dr. But since r = 1/plx, and dr= (dr/dplx) dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx.

So, volume dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx^2)) dplx) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx. The negative sign is because plx increases as r decreases, but I'm considering dplx as a positive change, so perhaps I should take the absolute value, so dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but that would make the volume proportional to 1/plx^4, but that seems a bit off. Because when plx is smaller (so r is bigger), the volume should be larger, right? Because each shell at a larger r has a larger volume.

Wait, but no, wait. Wait, plx is 1/r. So when plx is small (r is large), the distance dr (thickness) of the shell is larger, but the surface area is also larger. So the product is 4π r² dr. So for a given change in plx (dplx), how does this translate into the corresponding dr for each shell.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number per unit plx. Let me think of it as the number of stars per unit parallax interval (dN/dplx). So how does that scale with plx?

So, number of stars dN in a thin shell is n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per volume), which is constant.

dV is 4π r² dr. So, substituting r = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx) ) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But since dV is positive when dr is negative, perhaps I should take the absolute value, so dV = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Then, dN = n * dV = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, dN/dplx = 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, that suggests that the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. Option B is 1/plx^2.

But wait, another thought: The number of stars you can see at a certain distance (and thus a certain plx) depends on the area of the sphere and the thickness in distance. Alternatively, maybe I should think about how many stars are in a given range of plx, which corresponds to a range of distances.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^3. Because when you think about it, the volume element in spherical coordinates has a 1/r^2 factor, but the thickness in r is related to plx.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try this again.

We have r = 1/plx.

The volume element is 4π r² dr.

We want to express this in terms of plx.

So, r = 1/plx => dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, substitute:

dV = 4π r² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx) = -4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Again, the negative indicates that as plx increases (dplx positive), r decreases (dr negative). But the volume is positive, so perhaps I should ignore the sign.

So, dV = (4π / plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number of stars in this volume is n * dV = (4π n / plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is (dN/dplx) = 4π n / plx^4.

Which would make the number of stars per unit plx proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the volume of a shell at distance r is 4π r² dr, which is proportional to r² dr. Since r is 1/plx, then r squared is 1/plx^2, and dr is (1/plx^2) dplx (since dr = -1/plx² dplx, but taking absolute value for positive dplx).

Wait, but in this case, the number of stars per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

But I'm not sure because another way to think about it is considering the flux or density. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of solid angles and distance.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars per unit area (surface density) at a distance r is n * r², since the number in a volume is n * (4π r² dr), and per unit area (projected) would be n * r² dr, but that's perhaps not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, the number of stars per unit volume is n, so for a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π r² dr.

We can write this as n * 4π r² dr. But since plx = 1/r, plx = 1/r => r = 1/plx. So, substituting:

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr.

But dr = (dr/dplx) dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx. So,

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx²) dplx.

Again, the negative indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, but the number of stars is positive, so taking absolute value:

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember that the number of stars in a certain volume decreases with distance cubed, but that's when considering the same volume shell. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another way. The number of stars in a small volume dV is n dV. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. So, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r is n 4π r² dr.

But we're looking for how this number changes with plx. Since plx = 1/r, r = 1/plx. So, substituting:

dN = 4 π n (1/plx)^2 dr.

But dr is expressed in terms of plx: dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So,

dN = 4 π n (1/plx^2) (-1/plx²) dplx.

Again, the same as before, leading to dN proportional to 1/plx^4 dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

But looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4, which would make sense.

Wait, but I'm remembering something about the number of stars being inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, so maybe 1/r^3. But since r = 1/plx, that would be 1/(1/plx)^3) = plx^3. But that can't be right because the question is about how the number per unit plx changes with plx.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the number density. Wait, the number of stars in a volume dV is n dV. So, if the volume element in terms of plx is 1/plx^4, then the number of stars would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the correct option is A) ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit conflicted because another way: the number of stars per unit solid angle per unit distance is proportional to 1/distance squared (since the area of the sphere is 4π r²), but the number itself is n * 4π r² dr. So when plx is small (r is large), the number of stars in that shell is larger, which aligns with 1/plx^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) 1/plx^3, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: The number of stars in a shell at distance r with thickness dr is proportional to r² dr. Since plx = 1/r, dr = - (1/r²) dplx. Substituting r = 1/plx, dr = - plx² dplx.

So,

dN = 4 π n r² dr = 4 π n (1/plx^2) ( - plx² dplx ) = -4 π n dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Because then dN would be proportional to dplx, which would imply a linear relation, but that's conflicting with earlier reasoning.

Wait, that approach must be wrong. Because if I substitute r = 1/plx, then dr is (d r) = (-1/plx^2) dplx. So,

dN = 4 π n (1/plx^2) * ( - 1/plx^2 dplx ) = -4 π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

Hmm, that's the same as before. So dN is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

So, the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, another angle: The number per unit parallax interval (dN/dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So, looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4.

I think that's the correct answer.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance, such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the distance to the star. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi r^2 dr \). 

Since \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we can express the volume element in terms of parallax. Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \), the volume becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi r^2 dr = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases (closer stars), \( r \) decreases. Taking the absolute value, the volume element is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the number density of stars \( n \) multiplied by the volume, so:

\[
dN = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit parallax interval decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/\text{plx}^4**

Answer: A
