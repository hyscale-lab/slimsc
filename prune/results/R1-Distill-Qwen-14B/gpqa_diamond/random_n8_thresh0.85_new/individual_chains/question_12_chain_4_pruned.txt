Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. We need to find the kinetic energy of each product. The options are A to D, with various MeV values.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation laws are key. So, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction after the decay.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they are neutral and super light. I think in the Standard Model, neutrinos are considered to be massless, but wait, actually, in reality, they have tiny masses, but in many textbook problems, they are taken as massless for simplification. So I should assume the neutrino is massless here unless told otherwise.

So, let's outline the approach. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be greater than that. The neutrino's energy will be just its kinetic energy because its rest mass is (assumed) zero. Or wait, no, if the neutrino has zero mass, its total energy is just its kinetic energy. Hmm, but the muon's energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy.

Wait, let's think about energy conservation. The total energy after decay should equal the rest energy of the pion. So:

E_pion_initial = E_muon + E_neutrino

E_pion_initial is 139.6 MeV.

E_muon is the total energy of the muon, which is gamma * m_mu c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But since momentum is involved, perhaps it's better to use the relation between energy and momentum for each particle.

For the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 +
