Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Alright, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, it's a neutralization reaction. 

The problem states that we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate these two pH values.

Wait, let me jot down what I know. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and concentration is 0.05 M. Then adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh, right, dilution—so the concentration changes. 

First, maybe I should find the concentration after dilution. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). Let me compute that. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 (water) is 20 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 *20) /40 = 1/4 = 0.025 M. Oh, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume at equivalence point will be determined. Let's think: the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So moles of acetic acid initially: moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So initial moles of CH3COOH is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, no: wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, but after dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, 0.04 L. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be equal to moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH = 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the question isn't asking about the equivalence point directly yet; it's also asking about the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the way to equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at that point, how much acetic acid has reacted?

Let me think. Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So the initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001. Moles of NaOH added at 25%: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume at that point is initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L. So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let's see, 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait, but wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Because since we have a buffer solution here (some acid and its conjugate base), that equation would be applicable. 

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa of acetic acid is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. 1.85e-5 is approximately 2e-5, whose log is about 4.7. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733.

So the pH at 25% titration would be pKa + log(moles of A^- / moles of HA). Because in the Henderson equation, the ratio is ([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, wait, no. Because the concentrations are being considered, but since the same volume is present for both, the ratio of moles is same as ratio of concentrations. Because both are in same volume. So yes, [A^-]/[HA] = moles A^- / moles HA.

So at 25% titration, moles A^- (acetate) is 0.00025; moles HA (acetic acid) is 0.00075. So ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. 

So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Wait, but wait, the options have 4.26 as one of the choices. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52. Option D is 4.57;6.92. So perhaps the first value is 4.26, but I need to double-check the calculations.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the exact value without approximations. Let me compute the exact pKa. The Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/1.85e-5). Let me compute log(1.85e-5). Log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733. 

Then, for the 25% titration, where 25% of the acid has been neutralized. Wait, no: 25% of the titration refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. Since equivalence point requires 10 cm³ of NaOH, 25% is 2.5 cm³. Therefore, moles of NaOH added is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Which is 25% of the 0.001 mol of acetic acid. So, yes, 25% of the acid has been neutralized, so 75% remains. So the ratio is 1:3 (A^- to HA). So the log(1/3) is about -0.477, so pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is approximately 4.26. So that's the first value.

Now, the second part: the pH at equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of a weak acid. So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion will hydrolyze in water.

So, sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The acetate ion reacts with water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate ion at equivalence point is the moles of acetate divided by the total solution volume.

Wait, let's calculate the moles of acetate: at equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been converted to acetate. So moles of acetate = 0.001 mol. The total volume is initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus NaOH added (10 cm³?), wait no, wait. The equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. So total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.
