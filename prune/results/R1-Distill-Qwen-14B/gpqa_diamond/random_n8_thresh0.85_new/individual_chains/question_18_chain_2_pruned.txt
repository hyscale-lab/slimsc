Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, does the mass matter here? The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so I think the mass might not come into play directly. Maybe it's just extra info.

Alright, let's look at the given data. They've provided some abundance ratios determined using the EW method. So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, and the Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. 

Wait, I remember that the notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, relative to the Sun.

So I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. That is, (n_Si1 / n_Si2). Or wait, is it n_Si1 divided by n_Si2? Because the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms", but I think it's about the ratio between the two stars. 

Let me break it down. For each star, I can find the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen, using the given ratios, and then compare them. 

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log10(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log10(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3. But wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Which means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. So log10(n_Fe1/n_H1) = log10(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) + 0. So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun. 

For the Sun, 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) =7.5. So log10(n_Fe/n_H) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5). 

So for Star_1, n_Fe1/n_H1 = same as Sun, which is 10^(-4.5).

But I need n_Si1/n_H1. Hmm, how? Because I have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3, which is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) = 0.3.

Wait, let's compute each abundance.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5).

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) +0.3.

We know for the Sun, log(n_Si_sun/n_Fe_sun) is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. Wait, but wait, the Sun's data is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5. Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) is 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5. 

What about n_Si/nFe for the Sun? I don't have that directly. Oh wait, but I can compute it if I have more info. Alternatively, perhaps
