Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but let's try to break it down. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay, so first I think I need to figure out what that nucleus is.

Wait, Li is lithium, right? And lithium-6 maybe? Because natural lithium has isotopes, but 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. Because Li typically has 3 protons (since atomic number 3), so 3 protons + 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Next, I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic energy equations. Since the speed is given as a fraction of the speed of light (0.96c), I think relativistic effects are definitely in play here.

The energy in relativity is given by the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I'll need to compute gamma for v=0.96c.

Let me calculate gamma first. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait. Let me do that more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, yes. So square root is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so yeah, gamma is 1/(0.28) which is 3.5714286.

So now I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². But I don't know the mass of Li-6 off the top of my head. Hmm. I think I need to look up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, but maybe I can remember that the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Since Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, wait. No, actually, the mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy, but for this problem, perhaps we're supposed to model it using the rest mass of the nucleus, which is usually given in atomic mass units (u) or in GeV/c².

Alternatively, I remember that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 0.938 GeV/c². So protons and neutrons each have about 938 MeV/c², which is 0.938 GeV/c².

So for the Li-6 nucleus: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass would be 6 * 0.938 GeV/c². Let me compute that: 6 * 0.938 is 5.628 GeV/c².

So the rest mass energy is m c² = 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second. The mass of the nucleus is actually a little
