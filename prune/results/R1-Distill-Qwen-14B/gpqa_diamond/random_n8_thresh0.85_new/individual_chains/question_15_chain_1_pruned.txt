Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about detecting transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. They've already found these planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their minimum masses and orbital periods. 

Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their orbits are circular. The host stars have the same radii, but the star with Planet_1 is more massiveâ€”twice as much as Planet_2's star. Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, but I'm not sure how that affects this problem yet.

The main thing is figuring out which planet is more likely to transit. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. But wait, the RV method already tells us the minimum mass, but for transit probability, I think it's more about the orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, transit probability is also about how likely the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. But since both planets are already known via RV, which also gives some information about the inclination, right? Because RV detects the Doppler shift, which is more sensitive to planets with high inclination (edge-on). But wait, no, RV doesn't require edge-on orbits. It just needs a certain minimum mass and can give a lower limit on the mass. Unless they have prior information about the inclination, which I don't think they do. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, but the question says both planets have already been detected via RV, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. So I think the inclination is not known because RV only gives a lower limit on mass. So for transit probability, we have to consider the statistical probability of the planet's orbit being edge-on enough for a transit, regardless of RV detection. 

So, for a planet, the probability of it transiting is roughly (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but wait, that's the approximate formula. No, wait, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance, I think. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

The transit probability P is given by (R_*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 + (M_planet/M_*)^2)) )) but actually, no, that's more about the depth of the transit. Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for transit probability. I think the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_*/a) multiplied by (something else?), but I'm getting a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. So it's (2R_*) / (2a) ) = R_*/a. But wait, no. Because the chance is determined by the alignment of the orbit. 

Another way to think about it: the transit occurs when the planet passes directly in front of the star from our point of view. The probability depends on the size of the star relative to the size of the orbit. So the probability is roughly (R_*)/(a) multiplied by some factor considering the geometry, but I think the main factor is (R_*/a) * something else. Wait, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + e^2)^(something)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0. So maybe it simplifies. Let me look up the formula in my memory. Oh right, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is P = (R_* + R_p) / a, but R_p is the planet's radius, which is much smaller than the star's, so it's approximately R_* / a. 

Wait, but no, that's more for the depth. The probability is more about the alignment. The actual formula, if I
