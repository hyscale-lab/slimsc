Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let's see what it's about. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the thermal energy of the photons. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The Boltzmann equation tells us the ratio of populations in two energy levels. 

The Boltzmann distribution formula is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. 

In this problem, the energy difference (E) is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the statistical weights (g_i and g_j) might be the same because it's the same transition maybe. Or wait, the problem says the energy difference is between the considered energy levels. So, E = E_i - E_j. 

The question states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, for star_1, the ratio n_i/n_j is 2, and for star_2, it's 1, perhaps? Or wait, no. Let me see. If star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, their population in the higher energy level is higher. So, for each star, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) would be different.

Wait, no. The question says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2. But excitation level could mean the number of atoms in the excited state. So, for star_1, n_i is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Or wait, perhaps star_1's (n_i/n_j) is twice star_2's (n_i/n_j). Hmm, maybe not. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, let me rephrase. For each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level (n_i) to the lower (n_j) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio is (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and for star_2, it's (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). But the question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as high as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n_i/n_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe it's the population in the excited state that's higher by a factor of 2.

Wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited [...] when compared to star_2." So, more excited means higher population in the excited state. So the ratio (n_i) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, perhaps the excitation is the number of excited atoms, so (n_i)_1 = 2 * (n_i)_2. 

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, it's the ratio (n_i/n_j) that depends on temperature. So if star_1 has a higher ratio (n_i/n_j), that would mean more excitation. So, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2. So, n_i/n_j for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

So, let's set it up. Let’s denote the ratio as R1 for star_1 and R2 for star_2. Then R1 = 2 * R2.

The Boltzmann equation gives R = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since it's the same transition in the same element), then g_i/g_j is a constant. Let's denote this as a constant C. So R1 = C exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) and R2 = C exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

If R1 = 2 * R2, then:

C exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * C exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

We can cancel C from both sides (assuming it's not zero, which it isn't), so:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearranging:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me re-do the algebra. Let me write the equation again:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) -ΔE/(k T2)

I can rearrange this as:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] = ln(2)

Hmm. Let's factor the terms inside the brackets:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So, substituting back:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

But wait, the equation is:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because (1/T2 -1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, solving for (T1-T2)/(T1 T2), we get:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (ln(2) * k) / ΔE

But wait, the question is about the equation that relates T1 and T2. The options don't involve constants like k or ΔE, so perhaps the equation is the one without the ΔE and k terms, just relating T1 and T2.

Wait, looking at the options, all the equations are in terms of T1 and T2, so perhaps the equation can be written as ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2. So, from earlier steps, the equation was:

ΔE/(k) (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, rearranged:

( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2) * k / ΔE

But without knowing the values of k and ΔE, perhaps the equation we can write is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by (ΔE/k). But since the options don't have ΔE or k, perhaps the equation given in the options is the equation that the product (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) is equal to ln(2) multiplied by (k/ΔE), but without the constants, maybe the way the equation is presented is just the (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) part equals ln(2), but that's not correct because the equation also has a factor involving ΔE and k.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me think again. Another approach: we can take the ratio of the Boltzmann factors for the two stars.

So, ratio R1/R2 = (n_i1/n_j1)/(n_i2/n_j2) = 2 = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Because the statistical weights cancel out.

So 2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Which is 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

Taking ln both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

But the options don't have ΔE or k terms. So perhaps the equation in the options is written without those constants, but in terms of T1 and T2.

Looking at the options:

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but in our equation, we have (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) equals ln(2). So, the equation in the options that matches is option D, which is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), but that would mean that (ΔE/k) is equal to 1. So that can't be unless ΔE/k is indeed 1. Let me compute ΔE and k.

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J.

Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so ΔE equals k multiplied by some temperature? Let me see: ΔE = k * T * something.

Wait, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * (1.38e-23 J/K) * T, but wait, wait, that would require T=1 K. Hmm, but that's perhaps a coincidence. Wait, the given ΔE is exactly equal to k, because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So, when T is 1 K, k*T is 1.38e-23 J. So in this problem, ΔE is equal to k.

So, ΔE = k.

So in our equation, ln(2) = (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ]

Since ΔE = k, then (ΔE/k) = 1.

So, ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which matches option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of two stars, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), based on the observed excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the ratio of populations in two energy levels, given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2, leading to:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
\]

Assuming the statistical weights \( g_i/g_j \) are the same for both stars, the ratio of the Boltzmann factors gives:

\[
\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = 2.
\]

Simplifying, this becomes:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), it follows that \( \Delta E / k = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because they do not align with the derived relationship between \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \).

**Answer: D**
