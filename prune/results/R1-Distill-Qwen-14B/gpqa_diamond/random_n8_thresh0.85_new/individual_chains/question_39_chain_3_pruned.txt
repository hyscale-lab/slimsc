Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a'. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

So the setup is that each particle has a wave function given by (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. That means the wave function must be zero outside this region, right? Because the particle can't exist where the wave function is zero or has negligible probability.

Wait, no, actually, the wave function isn't necessarily zero outside. The wave function's square modulus (the probability density) probably drops to zero outside that region. So the wave function might be zero for x <1 and x>3, but in this problem it's given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for the part where it exists, which is between 1 and 3. Hmm, maybe I should check that.

Wait, the wave function is given as that expression in a part of space where the particle can exist, which is x between 1 and 3. So outside that region, the wave function is zero, I think. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

But wait, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. The wave function is a complex number. So for the wave function ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i, the absolute square is |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms would involve the real and imaginary parts multiplied together. Wait, no, the square of a complex number a + bi is (a^2 + b^2) when considering the magnitude squared. So |ψ|^2 = (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So their squares are (a²/(1+x)) and 0.25 respectively. So adding them, |ψ|² = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the magnitude squared is [
