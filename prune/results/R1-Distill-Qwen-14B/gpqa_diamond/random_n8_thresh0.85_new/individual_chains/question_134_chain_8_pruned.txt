Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, okay, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The formula I remember is usually ΔH = -n H+ × H+ (per mole of H+ ions) multiplied by the enthalpy per mole. Wait, but wait, wait. I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about 57 kJ per mole of H+ ions. But wait, no, wait a second, I think I might be mixing that up with something else. Or maybe it's 57 kJ per mole of H+? Or is it per mole of acid?

Let me think. Oh, right, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ from the acid. Because each mole of H+ released is neutralized by a mole of OH-. So, if you have an acid with multiple H+ ions, like H2SO4, each H+ contributes separately.

Wait, but wait, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete, but the second is not? Or is it? Wait, no, in the context of neutralization, for concentrated solutions, both H+ ions may dissociate. But when it's diluted, like when you mix, maybe only the first dissociation is considered. Hmm, but I think in this problem, since they're just giving the concentration, perhaps we assume that all H+ ions are available.

So, the problem is mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, these are all acids and a base. So when mixed, they'll react. Wait, but wait, when HCl and H2SO4 are mixed with Ba(OH)2, what happens?

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, so it would dissociate into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

So, the reaction will be between H+ ions (from HCl and H2SO4) and OH- ions from Ba(OH)2.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole releases about 57 kJ (but wait, the value I remember is 57 kJ per mole of H+). Wait, no, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid reacting. Wait, no, I think it's per mole of H+.

Wait, no, more accurately, each mole of H+ ion reacts with a mole of OH- to form water, releasing 57 kJ per mole of H+.

So the total enthalpy change would be the sum of H+ from all acids multiplied by 57 kJ, but with a negative sign because it's exothermic.

So let's compute the moles of H+ from each acid.

First, HCl: 0.2 M, 500 mL (which is 0.5 L). Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is monoprotic, moles of H+ = 0.1.

Second, H2SO4: 0.3 M, 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 H+, so total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a base. It provides OH- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

But wait, when we mix these, the H+ and OH- will neutralize each other. So the total H+ and OH- will determine which is in excess, but I think the question is about the neutralization that occurs, so we need to find the limiting reagent.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that all the H+ ions are neutralized by the OH- ions, but that might not be the case. Let me think. Let's compute total H+ and total OH-.

HCl provides 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 provides 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M in 200 mL (0.2 L) → moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28
