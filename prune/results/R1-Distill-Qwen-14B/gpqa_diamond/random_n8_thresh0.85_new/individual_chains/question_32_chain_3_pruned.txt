Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make its isotope Li-6 because the number of protons is 3 and neutrons 3, so 3+3=6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, which affects the energy required. So the energy in the collider is related to the kinetic energy of the ions.

Wait, no, actually, in particle accelerators, the beam energy is usually given as the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy, but sometimes just the kinetic part is considered. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think. Oh right, in particle physics, the energy is often expressed as the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy. But sometimes, especially in problems, it's easier to work with the kinetic energy. I need to clarify which one we're dealing with here.

The formula for relativistic energy comes into play here. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy (mc²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The problem gives the speed as 0.96c, so I can calculate gamma.

Let me compute gamma first. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

But wait, let me compute that more precisely. 1 divided by 0.28. Hmm, 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98. Oh wait, 0.28 * 3.57 is 1? Let me compute 3.5714 * 0.28.

0.28 * 3.5714: 3*0.28 is 0.84, 0.5*0.28 is 0.14, 0.07*0.28 is 0.0196, 0.0014 * 0.2
