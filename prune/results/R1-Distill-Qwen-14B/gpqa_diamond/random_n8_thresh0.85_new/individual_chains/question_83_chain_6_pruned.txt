Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I'll try to outline what I know. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when it's titrated with NaOH, which is a strong base, they react completely. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

So, the first step is dilution. We're mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. That's a 1:1 mix, so the total volume is 40 cm³. I remember that dilution can be calculated using the formula M1V1 = M2V2. So the initial concentration after dilution would be M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2.

Let's compute that. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. Oh wait, wait: 0.05 *20 is 1, and 1 divided by 40 is 0.025? Wait, no, wait: 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of millimoles to make it easier, since 1 cm³ is 1 mL and 1 M is 1 mol/L, which is 1 mmol/mL. So, 20 mL * 0.05 M = 1 mmol of acetic acid. Then, when diluted to 40 mL, the concentration is 1 mmol /40 mL = 0.025 M. Oh wait no, wait 20 mL of 0.05 M is 20 *0.05 =1 mmol. So 1 mmol in 40 mL is 0.025 M. Right, that's correct.

Wait, no, wait: 0.05 M is 0.05 mol per liter, which is 0.05 *1000 mmol/L =50 mmol/L. So 20 mL is 20 *50 mmol/L =1000 mmol? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 0.05 M is 0.05 mol per liter. 20 mL is 0.02 liters. So moles = 0.05 *0.02 =0.001 mol. Which is 1 mmol. So when diluted to 40 mL, concentration is 0.001 mol /0.04 L=0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration mean here? I think it means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Alternatively, sometimes it refers to the volume. So, perhaps 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence point.

Wait, perhaps I should first find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point. Then, 25% of that volume would be the point up to which we're calculating the pH.

So, let
