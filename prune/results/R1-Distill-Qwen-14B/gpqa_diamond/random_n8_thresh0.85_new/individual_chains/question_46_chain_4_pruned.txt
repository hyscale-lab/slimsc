Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene?

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually involving Ruthenium, right? It's used for ring-closing metathesis and for cross metathesis, but I think in this case it's about breaking the alkene and rearranging.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the molecule has a stereocenter, but wait, does 3-methylpent-1-ene have a double bond? Let me draw the structure.

Pent-1-ene has five carbons, double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So for pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let's count the carbons. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the third carbon is the one after the double bond. So when it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the third carbon is the one with the CH2 group. So adding a methyl group to the third carbon would make it CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but wait, that's seven carbons? No, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let's count again. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be something like CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, pentene has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1
