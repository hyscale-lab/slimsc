Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the final product is, given the IR and NMR data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I should recall what reaction conditions red phosphorus and HI typically lead to. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of certain groups. Wait, no, wait—another reaction comes to mind. Oh right! The reaction of a nitrile with red phosphorus and HI. That's the Stephen reduction, I think. Or wait, no, that's maybe something else. Alternatively, another possibility is the hydrolysis of an ester or maybe an acid chloride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or wait, maybe it's the conversion of a nitrile to an amine. Let me think. Oh, right! The Stephen reduction converts an alkyne to a ketone, but that's with a different reagent. Or wait, another reaction: when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it gets converted into an amine. Maybe the nitrile group (–CN) becomes –CH2NH2. But I'm not entirely certain about this. Alternatively, another possibility is that it's a reaction of a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the IR and NMR data to figure out what the starting material (Compound X) is. Then I can determine what the reaction does to it.

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That's a broad range, maybe indicating an -OH stretch or an amine NH. But wait, the 3400–2500 region could also be due to an ether (but that's usually lower, around 1100–1250 for C-O). Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ might be aromatic C=C stretches. So considering these, perhaps Compound X has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an -OH proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm and sharp. But this is broad, so more likely an -OH in a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, aromatic protons. Since it's two protons as a doublet, perhaps para-substituted. So maybe two protons on either side of the substituent.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, likely the other two protons of a para-substituted benzene ring. So this suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, 4-substituted.

Then, the next group:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl, or part of a CH group near an electronegative atom.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet integrating to two protons, perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to another CH or a carbonyl.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet as a doublet? Wait, no, it's a doublet. But wait, the splitting is a doublet. So three protons as a doublet. That suggests a CH(CH3) group, maybe a geminal substituent. Like a CH attached to two CH3 groups, but wait, 3H as doublet. Or perhaps a CH2CH(CH3)2? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2 connected to something else. Alternatively, 1.4 ppm is a downfield shift for a CH3 group. Like a methyl adjacent to an oxygen, but in this case, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, 1.7 ppm is m for 2H. So perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a CH, which is next to a carbonyl. Let me think: maybe like a propionyl group. For example, R-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet (no, wait, it's a triplet, but in the options, it's a triplet for 3H). That's a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So, maybe an ethyl group attached somewhere.

Putting this together: perhaps a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions. One substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester), and the other is an ethyl chain. But let me think again.

Looking at the NMR data, the 10.5 ppm is probably a carboxylic acid proton. So the compound has a -COOH group. Then, the IR would have a strong peak at ~1720 cm⁻¹, which fits a carboxylic acid (but wait, the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹, so that fits). The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are aromatic C=C, so the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents.

So, the structure must have a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group and another substituent which is an ethyl chain.

Looking at the NMR:

- The aromatic protons are para-substituted, so perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). For a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to one substituent would be at higher ppm than the other two. So, let's say substituent A is at position 1, substituent B at position 4.

If substituent A is a strong electron-withdrawing group (like a carbonyl), the adjacent protons (ortho) would be deshielded (higher ppm). So substituent A would cause the ortho protons to be around 8.0 ppm. Substituent B would be something else, perhaps an ethyl group or similar, causing the other two protons to be at 7.2 ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 8.0 ppm is a doublet integrating to 2H, and 7.2 is another doublet for 2H. So perhaps substituent A is at position 1 (so the ortho protons are at 8.0), and substituent B is at position 4, making the meta protons (relative to substituent B) at 7.2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, with substituent A being a carbonyl group, and substituent B being an ethyl chain.

Wait, perhaps substituent A is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or carboxylic acid), and substituent B is an ethyl group.

But wait, if substituent A is a carboxylic acid (COOH), then the other substituent B would be an ethyl group. So the molecule would be something like 4-ethylbenzoic acid. Let's see.

But looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are 8.0 (d) and 7.2 (d), each integrating to 2H. So if substituent A is at position 1 (COOH), then the ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be next to it. Those would be deshielded and appear upfield or downfield? Wait, the substituent is electron-withdrawing, so the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. So those would be at higher ppm, like 8.0 ppm. Then, the para position is substituent B (like ethyl), so the protons in positions 3 and 5 (ortho to substituent B) would be less deshielded, perhaps around 7.2 ppm. That makes sense.

So the benzene ring would have COOH at position 1 and an ethyl group at position 4? Wait, no, position 4 would be the para position relative to position 1. So substituent at position 4 would be the ethyl group. So the structure would be 4-ethylbenzoic acid.

Wait, but then looking at the NMR, the aromatic region would have two doublets. Let's think about 4-ethylbenzoic acid. The substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (ethyl). The ortho protons to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and appear around 8.0 ppm. The meta protons to COOH (positions 3 and 5) are adjacent to the ethyl group and would be at a lower ppm, like 7.2. That fits the NMR. So the aromatic protons are as expected.

Now, what about the other NMR signals? The 10.5 ppm would be the COOH proton. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). Let's see.

The ethyl group is at position 4. So, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, but then the ethyl group would have protons in the NMR. Let me think about that.

Wait, in the case of 4-ethylbenzoic acid, the ethyl group is attached to the benzene. The ethyl group would have -CH2CH2- but wait, no, it's a benzene ring with a CH2CH2CH3 group? Or wait, wait, the substituent at position 4 is an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So the ethyl group would have a CH2 adjacent to the ring and a terminal CH3.

The CH2 group adjacent to the ring would have protons around 2.6-3 ppm, perhaps. The terminal CH3 would be around 1.2 ppm, but that doesn't match the given data. Hmm.

Wait, in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 1H. That doesn't seem right for a simple ethyl group. Because an ethyl group adjacent to a benzene would have two sets of protons: the CH2 next to the ring (maybe around 2.6 ppm) and the CH3 at around 1.2 ppm. So the NMR doesn't quite align with that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent isn't an ethyl group but something else. Let me think. The NMR shows a 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). The 1.4 is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2 which is next to another CH. Like a CH2CH(CH3) group? Or perhaps a branching.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is for two protons. So maybe a CH2 group, possibly adjacent to a carbonyl. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group attached to something else, perhaps a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group or more like a branched chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, but that would have more protons. Let me think.

Another angle: the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be a ketone (about 1715 cm⁻¹), an ester (around 1735), or a carboxylic acid (1700-1725). Since the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is typical for a carboxylic acid, that suggests the carbonyl is a carboxylic acid. So substituent A is -COOH.

So the structure is a benzene ring with -COOH at position 1 and another substituent at position 4.

Looking at the other NMR signals, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let's see:

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the central CH2 of a butyl chain. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a certain way. Let me think. If substituent B is a propyl group, then the NMR would have a triplet for the terminal CH3, but that doesn't fit the data. Alternatively, maybe it's a tertiary butyl group.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH, which in turn is attached to something else. So perhaps a group like CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, the structure is -CH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)- something? Wait, no, let me get this straight. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-, and sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a tert-butyl group, which is (CH3)3C-.

But looking at the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (d) for 3H. That suggests that the methyl group is attached to a CH. For example, in a group like CH(CH3)2, the CH would be split into a doublet because of the neighboring CH3 groups. But wait, in that case, the CH would be a singlet, because the two CH3 groups are identical. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH2 is split by neighboring groups. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, looking at the NMR data again, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet (m) for 1H. That suggests a CH group that's adjacent to other protons. So perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group. Let me try to visualize the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3), but that doesn't fit the 1.4 ppm as a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's an isopropyl group attached to another CH2 group.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's try to think of the substituent as a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group has the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)-, right? No, wait, if it's a substituent attached to the benzene, the structure would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- something? No, maybe the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that would be a tert-butyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. For example, the substituent could be a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3) group, making it a isopropyl group. So, if the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2, then the NMR would have certain patterns.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, that's a ketone group, but I thought the substituent is a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2COOH group. But in that case, the NMR would show a different pattern. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl chain leading to a methyl group.

Wait, maybe I should look at the options to see what they are. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So looking at the options, they are all either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would mean a benzene ring with a -COOH group and a sec-butyl group at the para position.

Wait, what is a sec-butyl group? Let me think. A sec-butyl group is a four-carbon chain where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, for a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, butyl groups:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

iso-butyl: (CH3)2CHCH2- (attached at the first carbon).

sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. The butyl group has four carbons: the substituent is attached to the second carbon of a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not a full four carbons. Alternatively, the substituent is attached to the second carbon, so it's CH2CH(CH2CH3). But that would be a four-carbon chain: carbon 1 (CH2-), carbon 2 (CH-), carbon 3 (CH2-), carbon 4 (CH3). So the substituent is attached to carbon 2: so it's CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that would make the substituent a secondary carbon.

So, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene, then the NMR would show certain patterns.

So, in option C, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4, and a COOH at position 1.

So, what would the NMR look like?

The benzene ring would have substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl). The ortho protons (positions 2 and 6) would be adjacent to COOH, so they would be more deshielded and appear around 8.0 ppm as a doublet. The meta protons (positions 3 and 5) would be adjacent to the sec-butyl group and appear around 7.2 ppm as a doublet.

That aligns with the NMR data given. So the aromatic protons are accounted for.

Now, looking at the other signals in the NMR. The COOH proton is at 10.5 ppm, which matches.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – perhaps this is the CH group in the sec-butyl substituent. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH in the substituent. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the CH3 groups attached to the CH. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal CH3 group in the substituent.

Wait, let me think about the substituent structure. If it's a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

Wait, no, that would be a four-carbon chain with the substituent attached to the second carbon. So the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think about the NMR.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: so the structure is –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–, attached to the benzene. So the substituent has a central CH, which is connected to two CH2 groups and a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is –CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2–? No, that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–, but that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH(CH2CH3)– group. Wait, that might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent as a –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)– group. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene at the first carbon, then the next carbon is CH2, then the third is CH with two CH2CH3 groups attached? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2– group. But that would be a pentyl group, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)– group. So the substituent is –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)– attached to the benzene. Then, the CH in the middle (the second carbon) would have two CH2 groups attached: one to the benzene (CH2-) and one to CH2CH3, making it a sec-butyl group.

So the substituent is –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–, which is a four-carbon chain (butyl), attached via the second carbon (sec-butyl).

In this structure, the CH group (the second carbon) would have neighboring protons from the CH2 and the CH2CH3. So the CH would have a triplet or a multiplet.

Wait, in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be the CH in the substituent. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, perhaps the CH2 groups adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which would be the CH3 groups attached to the CH. And the 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H, which would be the terminal CH3 in the substituent.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to visualize the substituent as a sec-butyl group.

The substituent is –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)– attached to the benzene. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring – CH2 – CH(CH2CH3)

So, the CH2 group (attached to the ring) would have protons around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The CH group would be connected to the CH2 (ring side) and the CH2CH3 (ethyl group). The CH group's protons would be split into a multiplet due to coupling with both adjacent groups. So the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH group. Then, the CH2CH3 group would have a triplet for the terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). The CH in the middle has two CH3 groups attached (the CH2CH3 and the CH2 from the substituent), but wait, perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituent as being a –CH2–CH(CH3)2 group. That would be a tert-butyl group. So the substituent is –CH2–C(CH3)3. But that would make the substituent a tert-butyl group, but then the NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let's think: benzene ring – CH2–CH2–CH3. But that's a simple ethyl group, which doesn't fit the NMR data as the 1.7 and 1.4 ppm don't match.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a –CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. No, that's not a standard substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH(CH3)CH2 group. Wait, that would be a isopropyl group, but attached to another CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–CH(CH3)– group, making it a 3-methylbutyl group. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try another approach. The NMR data:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a single proton, so likely a CH group. It's a multiplet, so it's coupled to two or more other protons.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, likely a CH2 group adjacent to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A CH3 group attached to a CH, which is then attached to another group. So perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3 group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

Putting this all together, perhaps the substituent is a –CH(CH3)–CH2– group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene–CH2–CH(CH3)–, but that's a propyl group, which would have a CH2CH(CH3)2 structure. Wait, but that would make the substituent a secondary carbon.

Wait, in that case, the substituent would be –CH2–CH(CH3)–, but that's a three-carbon chain, making it a propyl group, not a butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a –CH(CH2CH3)–CH2– group. Wait, that would be a four-carbon chain, making it a butyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think about the IR and NMR again.

The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with a carbonyl group. The broad peak around 3400–2500 cm-1 is likely an -OH group, which suggests a carboxylic acid. So the substituent at position 1 is a -COOH group.

The substituent at position 4 is something that has a chain leading to a terminal CH3 and some branching. So, perhaps the substituent is a –CH2–CH(CH3)– group, making it a sec-propyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So the substituent is a four-carbon chain with the point of attachment at the second carbon. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring – CH2 – CH(CH2CH3) – ?

Wait, no, if it's a sec-butyl group, the substituent is attached at the second carbon. So the structure would be:

Benzene ring – CH2 – CH(CH2CH3) – .

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain? No, that's a three-carbon chain. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the butyl group.

Butyl groups have four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the substituent is –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–. Wait, that's only three carbons, unless it's –CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–. No, that would be a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is –CH(CH2CH2CH3)– attached to the benzene. But that's a four-carbon substituent, making it a butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is –CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2–, but that's a pentyl group.

I think I'm getting stuck on the substituent structure. Let's think about the reaction part. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So what happens when benzoic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, I think that when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. But in the case of a benzoic acid, the reaction might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction.

Wait, another reaction: when an acid chloride (like benzoyl chloride) reacts with HI, it can undergo hydrolysis to form the acid. But in this case, Compound X is the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester. But why would red phosphorus be involved?

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the hydrolysis of a benzyl cyanide. But if Compound X is a nitrile, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus would produce an amine.

But given the NMR data, the starting material has a COOH group, so it's a benzoic acid derivative. So perhaps the reaction is not involving the COOH group but something else in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps Compound X has an ester group (OAc, for example) that is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. But the IR data already shows a strong peak at 1720, which could be an ester. But the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which would suggest a COOH group, not an ester.

Hmm, conflicting thoughts here. Maybe I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So after the reaction, what would happen?

Wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps it's a reduction. But in the case of a benzoic acid, that's not likely. Unless there's another functional group present.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile attached to the benzene ring, and the reaction reduces it to an amine. But the NMR data suggests a COOH group, so that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid. But the question says that Compound X is the starting material, and after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, we get the product. So what would be the product?

Wait, another angle: red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave triple bonds (alkynes) into ketones (Stephen reduction). But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an acyl chloride. But the IR doesn't show the strong peak around 1800 cm⁻¹, which would be for an acyl chloride. Instead, the peak is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. So if Compound X is an ester, then after hydrolysis, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is a benzoic acid. So maybe the product is a benzoic acid, implying that the starting material was an ester.

But then the NMR data of Compound X would show an ester group, but the IR data given shows 1720, which could be an ester. However, the NMR has a broad peak at 10.5, which is not typical for an ester (esters usually don't have an -OH proton unless it's a hemiacetal or something).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to summarize:

1. Compound X has a COOH group (based on NMR and IR data).
2. It has a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (another group).
3. The substituent at position 4 is a CH2CH(CH3) group, perhaps a sec-butyl group, leading to the NMR signals.

So if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). Then, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, but benzoic acid wouldn't react with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, and the reaction is converting it into an amine.

Wait, but the NMR data suggests a COOH group, so perhaps the substituent is a nitrile.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If Compound X has a nitrile group, then the IR would show a peak around 2200 cm⁻¹, which I don't see here. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetylenic group, but I don't see a peak around 2100 cm⁻¹ in the IR data.

Wait, going back: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is key. Let me think of what reactions those reagents are involved in.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. The reaction is:

R–CN + H-I + P → R–CH2–NH2 + other products.

So if the starting material is a nitrile, the product would be a primary amine.

But in the given data, the NMR shows a COOH group, so perhaps Compound X is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring with a COOH group.

But wait, in that case, the IR would have a peak around 2200 cm⁻¹, which isn't present. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else. Let me think of another reaction involving red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another reaction: the dehydrohalogenation or the elimination of HX from a compound. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not recalling the exact reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the reduction of a carbonyl group. For example, using HI and red phosphorus to reduce a ketone to an alcohol. But the reaction conditions I'm not certain about.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. But again, the IR doesn't show a peak around 1800 cm⁻¹, which would be for an acid chloride.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction again. The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to give a product. The options are all either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. For example, if Compound X is an ester like benzyl acetate, then hydrolysis would give acetic acid. But that doesn't fit the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl carbonate ester, which upon hydrolysis would give benzoic acid. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is more likely to be a specific reaction. Let me think of the options. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So perhaps the reaction is converting a nitrile to an amine, but that doesn't fit because the starting material has a COOH group.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the reaction reduces it to a benzyl alcohol. But the options don't seem to fit that.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI: could it be the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's for ketones and uses different reagents.

Another thought: the reaction could be the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to an amine. So if the starting material is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring, the product would be an amine.

But in the NMR data, the starting material has a COOH group. So perhaps the starting material is a benzonitrile with a COOH group elsewhere. But then the reaction would produce a benzylamine and COOH.

Wait, but the product options don't include amines. They're all either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings without any functional groups.

Hmm. So perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the COOH group but a different part of the molecule.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a methyl ketone group, R-CO-CH3. Then, upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus, it could be reduced to R-CH(OH)-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, R-O-CO-R'. Then, hydrolysis with HI would produce a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a COOH group, so if the starting material is an ester, the product would be the acid, which is option C.

But then, what would the starting material look like? It would be the ester form of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would have an OR group instead of OH.

But then the NMR data would show an O-R group, perhaps as a singlet around δ 4 ppm for the OR. But the given NMR doesn't show that. So perhaps that's not the case.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to conclude.

Given the NMR and IR data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI: but wait, benzoic acid doesn't react with red phosphorus and HI. So perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe the substituent is a nitrile group, which upon reaction becomes an amine.

But the NMR data doesn't show a nitrile. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group, R-CO-CH2-CH3. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might reduce it to R-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl chloride, which upon reaction with HI would undergo substitution. But that doesn't fit the NMR data.

I think I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. Based on the NMR and IR data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI may reduce the substituent, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the hydrolysis of a benzyl cyanide to a benzyl amine. But again, the starting material doesn't show a nitrile peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of HBr from a bromide. But I don't see any evidence for that in the NMR.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the reagents again: red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. So if the starting material has a nitrile group, the product would be an amine.

But the NMR data of the starting material doesn't show a nitrile peak. So perhaps the starting material is a nitrile attached to the benzene ring, and the product is an amine.

But then, the NMR would have a peak for the nitrile, which it doesn't. So perhaps that's not the case.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI probably doesn't change it because benzoic acid isn't reactive under those conditions. So perhaps the reaction is a different one, and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid. So starting material is the ester, product is the acid.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, then upon hydrolysis with HI, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). So the product is option C.

But the NMR data was for Compound X, which is the starting material. Wait, no, the question says Compound X reacts with reagents to give a product. So the given NMR is for Compound X, and the product is the answer.

Wait, no, the question states that Compound X has the given IR and NMR data. So after reacting with red phosphorus and HI, the product is one of the options.

So if Compound X is the ester, then the product would be the acid (option C). So the reaction is hydrolysis of the ester to the acid.

But the NMR data of Compound X would then show an ester group, not a COOH group. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine. So if Compound X is a nitrile, then the product would be an amine. But the NMR data shows a COOH group, so that's conflicting.

Another possibility: the substituent is an acyl chloride, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But again, the IR data doesn't show a peak for an acyl chloride.

I'm really not making progress here. Perhaps I should try to summarize:

Based on the NMR and IR data, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI doesn't change this molecule, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the reaction is not on the substituent but elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: what if the substituent is a ketone, R-CO-CH3, and the reaction is the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol? So the product would be R-CH(OH)-CH3.

But the options don't show an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else.

Wait, I'm going to have to make a guess. Given the data, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the reaction doesn't change the COOH group. So the product is the same as the starting material, which can't be the case. So perhaps the reaction is converting a nitrile to an amine, but the starting material has a COOH group. So perhaps the substituent is a nitrile and the COOH is elsewhere.

But without a nitrile peak in the IR, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a methyl ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to the acid. So the product would be option C.

But I'm not sure.

After considering all the possibilities, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure.

### Key Observations from IR and NMR Data:
1. **IR Data**:
   - A strong peak at **1720 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - Peaks at **3400–2500 cm⁻¹** indicate an -OH group, consistent with a carboxylic acid.
   - Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest aromatic C=C bonds.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - A broad singlet at **10.5 ppm** is characteristic of an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
   - Two doublets at **8.0 ppm (2H)** and **7.2 ppm (2H)** indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - Peaks at **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**, **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**, **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**, and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** suggest a branched alkyl chain, likely a sec-butyl group.

### Structure of Compound X:
- The IR and NMR data indicate that Compound X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. This structure includes:
  - A **benzoic acid** group (-COOH) at position 1.
  - A **sec-butyl group** (-CH2-CH(CH3)-) at position 4.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
- Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. However, in this case, the starting material is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, which does not contain a nitrile group.
- Since the reaction conditions do not alter the carboxylic acid group or the sec-butyl substituent, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Conclusion:
The reaction does not change the structure of Compound X, and the final product is the same as the starting material.
