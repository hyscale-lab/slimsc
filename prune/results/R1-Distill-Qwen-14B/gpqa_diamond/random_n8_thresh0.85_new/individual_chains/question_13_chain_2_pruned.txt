Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. The (R) configuration suggests it's the enantiomer of the (S) form. Its structure is a bicyclic monoterpene, probably like menthol but with a different structure. Wait, limonene is more like a bicyclic monoterpene, right? So it's a cyclic structure, maybe a bicyclic with a double bond.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. So, hydrogenation. Since it's catalytic hydrogenation, and Pd/C is a catalyst, likely the double bond is being hydrogenated. Limonene has a double bond in its structure, so adding hydrogen would saturate it. Since it's stirred with hydrogen, it should go to the fully hydrogenated form. So limonene, when hydrogenated, becomes... I think it's called dipentenylcyclohexane or something like that. Wait, maybe it's converting the bicyclic structure into a single ring? Or maybe hydrogenating just the double bond to become a cyclohexane derivative.

Wait, limonene's structure is a bicyclic monoterpene. Oh, wait, no, limonene is actually a monocyclic monoterpene; it's a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond. Let me think: limonene is (R)-(+)-limonene, which has a structure of a substituted cyclohexene. So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and some substituents.

So when we hydrogenate it, the double bond would be reduced. So the product 1 would be the hydrogenated form, which is a cyclohexane ring. So the substituents would remain, but the ring becomes saturated.

Wait, but what about the stereospecificity? Hydrogenation of a cyclic monoterpene would add hydrogens across the double bond. Since limonene is (R) configuration, the hydrogenation could lead to either a cis or trans addition, but wait, hydrogenation of a double bond in a ring would typically open it and form a bicyclic structure? Or is it a monocyclic? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene.
