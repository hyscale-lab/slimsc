Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal when they visualized the mice under the confocal microscope. Let's go through the setup step by step.

First, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with a specific structure. The construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which means it contains two coding sequences (cistrons) under a single promoter, separated by an IRES element.

So the vector has the ligand ORF first, with mCherry fused at the 5' end, and the receptor ORF comes after the IRES, with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Wait, no, the setup says the ligand is under the CBA promoter, but the vector is bicistronic. Oh wait, no, the vector is set up with the ligand and receptor each in their own cassette, each under their own promoters perhaps? Hmm, maybe not. Let me parse it again.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Oh, but the vector is bicistronic, meaning both ORFs are under the same promoter? Or each is under different promoters? No, bicistronic vectors typically have one promoter driving both cistrons, with the IRES allowing for internal ribosome entry, so the second cistron can be translated after the first. So the promoter for the bicistronic vector is probably a strong one, like CMV, but in this case, the ligand is under CBA. Maybe the vector's promoter is CBA, which is a strong promoter. Wait, no, the setup says the ligand is under the CBA promoter, meaning that the ligand's expression is driven by CBA. But wait, since the vector is bicistronic, perhaps the ligand and receptor are both under the same promoter, but the ligand's ORF is first, followed by IRES, then receptor. Hmm, not entirely sure about that part.

But the stop cassettes are present. The ligand ORF has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after it, so without Cre, the ligand is not expressed because the stop cassette blocks the ORF. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before it. Wait, no: between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP cassette. So the ligand ORF is followed by a stop, and to express the ligand, Cre would excise the stop. Similarly, the receptor ORF is followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette, so Cre (lox2272 Cre) would excise that stop.

Wait, no. Let me read that again. Between ligand ORF and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So the ligand is in front of the stop cassette. So the plasmid is ligand, followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry? Wait, no. The stop cassette probably stops the expression of the ligand, unless Cre excises it. Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES, and before the eGFP, there's a stop in lox2272 cassette.

So the setup is that in the vector, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette. Then the receptor is under IRES, but with another stop cassette. But wait, in a bicistronic construct, the two ORFs are driven by the same promoter. So perhaps the promoter is CBA, and the vector is such that the ligand is first, then the receptor after the IRES. But each has a stop cassette which would prevent their expression unless Cre is used to excise them.

So when you use lox-Cre, it would excise the loxP stop cassettes, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as a fusion. Similarly, the lox2272 Cre would excise the other stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. But wait, in this question, they've used a bicistronic vector, but the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development, so SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 regulatory elements, meaning Cre is active in neural crest cells.

So the construct is probably designed so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. Ligand would be expressed as a fusion to mCherry, and receptor as a fusion to eGFP.

Now, the problem is that when they look at the mouse offspring under confocal, there's no green signal. eGFP is the green fluorescent protein. So the receptor-eGFP fusion isn't being expressed, hence no green.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that matter for expression in the mouse? The question is about expression of the construct, not the function of the ligand-receptor pair. So this may not explain the lack of GFP signal. If the ligand and receptor are in paracrine, that's about their function, not expression.

Option B: receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct is properly made, the receptor would be on the cell surface. If it's stuck in Golgi, perhaps because of a stop in transport. But the issue here is that the construct isn't being expressed at all. Because if it were stuck in the Golgi, you might not see fluorescence in fixed cells, but I'm not sure.

Option C: enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so perhaps it's constitutive. So if the enhancer is missing, expression would be low. But how would that affect the Western blot and the GFP expression?

The question states that they tested the construct expression on Western blot after transfection into primary astrocyte culture. The blot shows a signal proportional to actin loading, which suggests that the proteins are being expressed. So the problem isn't in the expression; the expression is working. Otherwise, the Western would have shown no signal.

Wait, the problem says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested on Western blot. So the expression levels correlate with actin, which means the constructs are being expressed correctly. So in the Western, perhaps both ligand and receptor proteins were detected, but in the mouse, the eGFP is not being expressed.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct in the wt background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre. So the Cre is active in the neural crest cells, which would excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression of ligand and receptor.

But in the mouse, the eGFP (receptor) is not being expressed. So on Western blot, they saw expression when the plasmid was transfected, but in the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't happening. Or maybe the expression of the receptor is not happening because of a frame issue.

Wait, the question says that the vector has the ligand ORF at 5', then a stop in loxP cassette. The receptor is at 3', preceded by IRES, and with a lox2272 stop cassette before the eGFP. So when Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 sites would be recognized. SOX10-Cre is a Cre that can recognize loxP sites, but lox2272 is a variant. Wait, no. SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre, which can cut loxP sites. But the lox2272 is a mutated site that requires Cre with a mutation (like lox2272 Cre), but wild-type Cre can't cut it. So if the construct has a loxP and lox2272 cassette, which would require different Cre variants to excise.

Wait, let me clarify. The ligand is in front of a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, so when you have a Cre (like the standard Cre, which recognizes loxP sites), the stop would be excised, allowing ligand expression. The receptor is in front of a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. So to excise that, you need a Cre that can recognize lox2272. But the SOX10-Cre is a standard Cre, which doesn't cut lox2272. So the lox2272 stop cassette isn't excised, meaning the receptor is not expressed. Therefore, the eGFP isn't expressed either, so no green signal
