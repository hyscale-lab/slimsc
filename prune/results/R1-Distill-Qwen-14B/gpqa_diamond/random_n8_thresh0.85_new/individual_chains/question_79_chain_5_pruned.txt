Okay, so I've got this NMR question to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. But let's think through it step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what X was.

Wait, wait. Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. Oh wait no, wait. Oh wait, no, actually, I think that's for making something else. Oh wait, no, maybe it's for epoxidizing double bonds. Because epoxidation involves adding an oxygen across a double bond, forming an epoxide.

So, if the product is an epoxide, then the starting material must have a double bond that was epoxidized. So compound X had a double bond, and after reaction with this reagent, it becomes an epoxide.

Let me look at the NMR data of the product. The product has the following 1H NMR signals:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, in 1H NMR, there are two singlets at around δ2.28 and 2.31, each integrating to 3H. So that's two methyl groups. Singlet means they're probably attached to something that doesn't have any neighboring protons, like a quaternary carbon or attached to an electronegative atom. So maybe they're on an aromatic ring (as in para or meta positions) or perhaps on an epoxide ring.

Wait, but if it's an epoxide, the oxygen is part of a three-membered ring, which would cause the neighboring CH2 groups to be deshielded. But in this case, the methyl groups are singlets, so maybe they're attached to carbons that aren't adjacent to any protons. Hmm.

Looking at the aromatic region: 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). So that's a total of 1H + 2H + 1H + 2H = 6H? Wait, but the integration for aromatic protons is 1+2+1+2=6, but the molecule has 11 carbons and X is C11H12O. Wait, but the product is probably the epoxide, which would have an oxygen but same number of carbons?

Wait, the formula of X is C11H12O. Let me think: when a double bond is epoxidized, it adds an oxygen but doesn't change the number of carbons. So the product would have the same number of carbons as X, which is 11. So the product also has C11H12O? Or wait, no, the product would have an epoxide, which comes from a diene, perhaps. Let me calculate the formula.

Epoxidation is when a double bond (each bond is two carbons) reacts with an epoxy group. The reaction adds an oxygen atom. So if the starting material is R-O-R with a double bond, then the product would have an epoxide. So the formula would be the same as the starting material plus an O? Wait no, because the starting material has a double bond, like R-O-R with a double bond. Wait, no, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is used with an oxidizing agent, perhaps, to form the epoxide. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, perhaps the reagent is using a peracid, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, but perhaps in this context, it's part of a reaction where the epoxide is formed. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst for some kind of ring-opening. Hmm, no, wait. Oh, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent in the Sharpless epoxidation, which is used to epoxidize certain dienes. But that's for asymmetric epoxidation, but in this case, since the reaction conditions are given, maybe it's a standard epoxidation.

But regardless, the product is an epoxide, so the NMR should reflect that.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the downfield signals are 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). So this looks like a substituted benzene ring. Let's think: in a para-substituted benzene, you have two doublets each integrating to 2H. Wait, but here we have 2H, 1H, 2H, 1H. Which could suggest a substituent pattern where there's a group in the ortho and para positions relative to another group. Or perhaps it's a styrene structure.

Wait, let's draw this. Suppose the benzene ring has substituents in the para and ortho positions. Let me think about the coupling. For a para-substituted benzene with another substituent in the ortho position, but that might be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe it's a styryl group (a vinyl group attached to benzene) which would have coupling between the vinyl protons. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be split into multiple doublets.

Wait, the aromatic region shows four doublets. So perhaps it's a 1,2,4-substitution on the benzene ring. Or maybe it's a para-substituted group with another substituent.

Wait, but let's think about the product. The product is an epoxide, so the starting compound X had a double bond, which was converted into an epoxide. The product's structure would have an epoxide ring attached to a styryl group (vinyl benzene) or something similar, perhaps.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

δ 21.3 (1C, s), 28.4 (1C, s), 126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

So the 13C NMR shows a peak at 197.7, which is indicative of an epoxide carbon. Because epoxide carbons are usually around 60-70 ppm, but wait, no, wait. No, wait, that's for aldehyde or ketone. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think: carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) are around 20
