Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, phase shifts are involved in scattering amplitudes. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of the partial wave expansions. Each partial wave is associated with a phase shift, δ_l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number.

The general form of the scattering amplitude is given by:
f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l +1) exp(iδ_l) sinδ_l / (1 - exp(-2iδ_l)) ] * P_l(cosθ)
where k is the wave number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But wait, wait. Alternatively, I think the expression might be f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (sinδ_l) / (1 + cosδ_l) ) ] P_l(cosθ). Or maybe it's another form. Let me get this straight.

Alternatively, I remember a formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. The imaginary part, Im f(θ), is given by (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). Because when you expand the amplitude, the real and imaginary parts come from the exponential. Hmm, because exp(iδ) = cosδ + i sinδ. So when you have terms like sinδ and multiply by other parts, perhaps only the imaginary part comes from the sinδ part.

Wait, looking back, the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ). Because the phase shift comes into play in the partial wave expansion. So if I expand [e^{2iδ_l} -1], that's equal to e^{iδ_l} * [e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}] = 2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l. So then, substituting that in, f(θ) becomes (1/(2ik)) * 2i Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ). The 2i and 1/(2ik) would cancel out to 1/k. So f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but e^{iδ_l} is cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So when you multiply that by sinδ_l, you get e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l = sinδ_l cosδ_l + i sin²δ_l. So when you sum over l, the f(θ) has real and imaginary parts.

But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The incident beam direction is θ=0, right? Because that's the direction of the incoming particles. So cosθ would be cos(0) = 1.

Wait, but let's think about the Legendre polynomials. The P_l(1
