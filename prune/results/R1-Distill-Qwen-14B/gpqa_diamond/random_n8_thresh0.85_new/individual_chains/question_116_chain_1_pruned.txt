Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that NMR signals can tell us about the structure of the molecule. Let me think about what these signals indicate.

The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H makes me think of a methyl group attached to something that splits the signal into a triplet. Wait, a triplet usually arises from coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe the methyl groups are next to a CH2 group. Because each of the two protons in the CH2 would split the methyl signal into a triplet. But wait, 6H suggests there are two methyl groups (each with 3H). Oh, right, so perhaps it's two equivalent methyl groups attached to a CH2.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet usually comes from coupling with three equivalent protons, which would mean each of those 4H is next to a CH3 group. Wait, but 4H as a quartet. So for example, if you have a CH2CH3 group, the CH2 would show up as a quartet if it's next to a CH3. Because each H in CH2 would be split by the three H's in the adjacent CH3, leading to a quartet (n+1 = 3+1=4). So that's 2H as a quartet? But wait, in this case, it's 4H, so maybe two CH2 groups each showing up as quartet? Or perhaps a single CH2 group next to two CH3 groups?

Wait, putting it together. Compound A has two signals. Let's think about common structures. Maybe it's a di-substituted cyclohexane? No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a compound with two methyl groups attached to a central CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group that's next to another group.

Wait, another possibility: maybe compound A is neopentyl something? Neopentyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-. Wait, but that's a chain. Let me think about the NMR.
