Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, let me try to unpack it. 

So, the setup is that Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like below 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules so that the electron microscopy is better because fewer gas particles would interfere with the electrons.

But even with that vacuum, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1, considering things like the volume, pressure, and temperature of the sample compartment. 

Now, when he starts the electron beam, something interesting happens. The mean free path changes—it's now λ2, and this happens even though the temperature is the same. So, why would λ2 be different from λ1?

Wait, I remember that the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula I think is λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of the gas, and σ is the collision cross-section. Oh right, and the number density n is proportional to the pressure P divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. So n = P/(k*T * something else? Or wait, the ideal gas law is PV = NkT, so n = N/V = P/(kT) * (1), assuming V is the volume. So yeah, n is proportional to P/(kT).

In Mike's case, the vacuum is already ultra-high, so the pressure is super low. But when he turns on the electron beam, maybe the conditions change. What could cause a change in the mean free path without the temperature changing? Let me think about factors that affect the MFP other than pressure and temperature.

Wait, the electron beam itself could be causing something. Oh, right! When the electron beam is on, it might be ionizing the gas molecules or charging them. If the gas molecules get charged, they might interact with the charged particles in the beam or the walls of the compartment. But wait, the question says the temperature is the same, so perhaps the pressure hasn't changed. Or maybe the ionization affects the mean free path.

Wait, or maybe the electron beam is causing the gas atoms to become ionized. If the gas particles are ionized, they might have a different effective cross-section for scattering. Or perhaps the presence of the charged particles changes the way they collide, altering the mean free path.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be excited or even pumped out of the compartment. But if the pressure is already at 1e-9 Torr, which is really low, maybe the number of gas molecules is so low that their mean free path is already very long. But when the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, leading to more frequent collisions, thereby changing λ.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to move faster. But wait, the temperature is the same, so the average kinetic energy should be the same. Hmm, that doesn't change the mean free path as λ depends on n and σ.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path in the initial condition (before the beam) is λ1. When the beam is on, perhaps the electrons are colliding with the gas molecules more frequently. But wait, the gas molecules are already present, and their mean free path is λ1, which is the average distance they travel between collisions with each other. Now, when the electron beam is on, perhaps the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules. So the electrons' mean free path would be different, but the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. Wait, the question says that after initiating the electron beam, Mike observed that the mean free path of the gas molecules was λ2, not λ1. So the MFP of the gas molecules changed. Why?

Hmm. Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be ionized, making them charged. Charged particles would have different behavior in the vacuum, perhaps sticking to the walls or the sample, which would effectively decrease the number density of free gas molecules. If the number density n decreases, then the mean free path λ increases, since λ = 1/(nσ). So if n decreases, λ increases.

Wait, but if n decreases, that would imply that the pressure has decreased. But the pressure is already at ultra-high vacuum. Maybe the beam is causing some pumping effect, but that's perhaps negligible. Alternatively, the ionized gas molecules might have a different cross-section for scattering. For example, charged particles might have a larger effective cross-section because of their charge, leading to more frequent collisions. So σ increases, which would decrease λ.

But wait, the problem states that the temperature remains the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional factors. For instance, the gas molecules might be heated by the beam, but the sample's temperature is maintained, so perhaps the gas's temperature is the same. Or maybe the beam causes some gas molecules to be removed from the compartment. But if the gas pressure is already very low, maybe it's not the case.

Wait, another thought: in the absence of the electron beam, the gas molecules are in thermal equilibrium, so their mean free path is λ1. When the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, causing them to move more, or perhaps their effective cross-section changes because of the interactions with the electrons.

Wait a minute, in the initial state, the mean free path is λ1, which is determined by the usual factors. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules now have more interactions because the electrons are providing another source of scattering. So the gas molecules might have a higher rate of collisions due to the electrons, which would effectively change their mean free path.

Wait, but the mean free path for the gas molecules would be determined by their own collisions, not with the electrons. Unless the electrons are causing the gas molecules to collide more frequently.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the electron beam particles (the electrons), but I'm not sure if that would significantly affect the MFP of the gas molecules. Alternatively, maybe the gas molecules are being torn apart or ionized, which changes their effective size for scattering.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to be more conductive, leading to lower pressure as the ions get attracted to the walls or something. But that might require the beam to be doing some pumping, which might be a stretch.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path of the electrons in the electron beam is affected by the gas molecules. But the question is about the gas's mean free path. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being excited, so their effective cross-section for mutual collisions increases. For example, if they become charged, their cross-section might be larger because the electric fields interact more. So σ increases, which would make λ = 1/(nσ) decrease. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about the formula for mean free path. Mean free path λ is 1/(nσ√2), where σ is the collision diameter. If the presence of the electron beam increases σ, then λ decreases. So λ2 < λ1, which would make option C correct.

But why would the electron beam cause σ to increase? Maybe because the gas molecules are ionized, making their effective size larger. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam's energy causes the gas molecules to be in a higher energy state, making them more likely to collide. But that's kind of similar to increasing the temperature, which would affect the mean free path. However, the problem states that the temperature remains the same.

Wait, but in the initial state (before the beam), the gas is at a certain pressure and temperature, giving λ1. When the beam is on, the gas's effective σ might change. For example, if the gas is ionized, the cross-section for collisions could increase because the charged particles interact more strongly. So σ increases, which would reduce λ.

If that's the case, then λ2 would be less than λ1. So the mean free path decreases.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam doesn't directly change the cross-section of the gas molecules, but increases their speed. But with the same temperature, their speed distribution remains the same, so the mean speed shouldn't change.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps when the beam is on, the gas molecules are being removed from the compartment because they are being ionized and then accelerated by the electric fields in the microscope. That would lower the number density n, increasing λ. So λ2 would be higher than λ1.

But wait, the initial λ1 was determined under the same vacuum conditions. So if the pressure is the same, n is the same, but perhaps the presence of the beam changes the effective cross-section of the gas molecules for some reason.

Alternatively, maybe the mean free path of the gas molecules for electron scattering is different, but that's a different concept. The question is about their own mean free path, not the electrons'.

Wait, another approach: think about what affects the mean free path.

Factors: pressure, temperature, and the collision cross-section. Since the temperature is the same, and the pressure (as per the vacuum system) is the same, why would λ change?

Ah, wait, but maybe the electron beam introduces a source of ionization, which can lead to a change in the effective pressure if the ionized particles are being pumped away. So perhaps the effective pressure is lower when the beam is on, which would increase λ.

Wait, but the question states that the sample compartment's temperature remains the same, but doesn't say anything about the pressure. So, if the electron beam somehow causes the pressure to drop, that would mean n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

But how would the electron beam cause the pressure to drop? Maybe by making the gas molecules stick to the walls or be pumped out more efficiently. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam creates a static electric field that affects the gas molecules, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the gas particles, when ionized, have a higher rate of collisions with the walls or other parts of the microscope, effectively reducing their number density, which would increase λ. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Wait, but if the pressure is lower, then n is lower, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

But earlier I thought that the cross-section might increase, which would cause λ to decrease. So which effect is more significant?

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

B) λ2 = λ1, implying Mike's observation is wrong.

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So, if the cause is a decrease in n, λ increases. If the cause is an increase in σ, λ decreases.

Wait, but why would the presence of the electron beam affect n or σ?

If the beam is causing gas ions to be extracted or pumped out, that would reduce n, increasing λ. So λ2 > λ1.

Alternatively, if the beam causes the gas to become ionized, which increases the cross-section, then λ2 < λ1.

Which effect is dominant in this scenario?

I think the key here is that the mean free path λ is calculated based on the gas's own collisions. When the electron beam is turned on, perhaps the gas molecules are being ionized, leading to more frequent mutual collisions because the cross-section σ increases. For example, charged particles may have a larger effective diameter. So σ increases, making λ = 1/(nσ) decrease. Therefore, λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but in that case, λ2 would be smaller, so option C would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to be removed from the compartment, so n decreases, leading to longer λ. That would make λ2 > λ1.

But the initial setup already has an ultra-high vacuum, so further reduction in pressure is maybe minimal.

Hmm.

Wait, the question says Mike accurately determined λ1, considering factors like sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So λ1 is based on the initial state without the electron beam.

Upon initiating the beam, λ becomes λ2. So, in the presence of the beam, the conditions for the gas have changed in a way that affects λ.

Another thought: the electron beam provides a source of energy that might break the gas molecules into smaller fragments. If the gas molecules are broken down, the effective σ might decrease, leading to a longer λ. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, the beam might cause gas molecules to stick to the walls or other surfaces, thus reducing their number density, which would increase λ.

Wait, but if the number of gas molecules decreases, n decreases, so λ = 1/(nσ) increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Which effect is more significant? If the pressure is already extremely low, maybe the change in n is negligible. But if the beam causes ionization, which increases σ, then λ decreases.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the beam induces a change in the effective cross-section due to the increased energy of the gas molecules, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the mean free path of the gas is affected by the presence of the electron beam because the electrons are scattering off the gas molecules. This process could influence the gas molecules' motion, perhaps causing them to have a longer mean path because they are less likely to collide with each other. Or the opposite.

Wait, but the electron beam's scattering would affect the electrons' path, not the gas's. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with the walls or other structures, effectively removing them from the volume, thus decreasing n and increasing λ.

But if the pressure is already super low, maybe this effect isn't significant. Alternatively, it's possible that the presence of the electron beam doesn't change the pressure much, but changes the way gas molecules behave, like making their cross-section bigger.

I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about the physics equations.

The mean free path λ is given by:

λ = 1 / (n σ √2 )

Where n is the number density (n = P/(k T)), and σ is the collision diameter.

If the pressure (P) remains the same, and T is the same, then n remains the same. So λ should stay λ1, which would make option B correct. But the question states that λ changed, so something else is affecting λ.

Wait, but wait. If the beam is causing the gas to ionize, the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, and the number of charged particles increases. Neutral particles don't ionize each other, but charged particles might. Wait, but would that affect the collision cross-section?

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas particles have a different cross-section for collisions. For example, ions have a larger effective size due to their charge, so σ increases. So if σ increases, λ decreases.

So λ2 = 1/(n σ_beam), where σ_beam is larger than σ_initial. So λ2 < λ1.

In that case, the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.

But wait, the presence of the beam doesn't change n if the pressure remains the same. Unless the beam affects the pressure.

Alternatively, if the beam is causing the gas molecules to be removed, which would lower n, but I'm not sure how much.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam causes the gas to expand, lowering the pressure, which would increase λ.

Wait, but the pressure is already extremely low. Maybe the effect is negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam doesn't change the pressure, but changes σ.

So, if σ increases, λ decreases.

Therefore, the conclusion is λ2 < λ1, which is option C.


To analyze the situation, we consider the mean free path (MFP) of gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum of the electron microscope. The MFP, given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma},
\]

depends on the number density \(n\) and the collision cross-section \(\sigma\). The number density \(n\) is proportional to the pressure \(P\) and inversely proportional to the temperature \(T\), as per the ideal gas law. The problem states that the temperature remains constant, so any change in \(\lambda\) must arise from changes in \(\sigma\) or \(P\).

Initially, Mike determines the MFP as \(\lambda_1\) under the ultra-high vacuum conditions. Upon initiating the electron beam, he observes a new MFP, \(\lambda_2\), which differs from \(\lambda_1\). The key question is: why does \(\lambda_2\) change?

### Analysis of Possible Causes:
1. **Effect of the Electron Beam on Pressure (\(P\)):**
   - The electron beam could potentially alter the pressure by removing gas molecules from the compartment (e.g., through ionization or pumping effects). If the pressure decreases, the number density \(n\) decreases, and thus \(\lambda\) increases. This would imply \(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1\). However, the initial pressure is already extremely low (below \(10^{-9}\) Torr), so this effect is likely negligible.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam on the Collision Cross-Section (\(\sigma\)):**
   - The electron beam can ionize the gas molecules. Ionized particles have an increased effective cross-section for collisions due to their charge, which enhances interactions between gas molecules. This would result in a larger \(\sigma\), leading to a smaller MFP (\(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\)).

3. **Other Considerations:**
   - The electron beam does not directly affect the temperature, as stated. It also does not significantly alter the speed distribution of the gas molecules, as the temperature remains constant.
   - The mean free path of the electrons in the beam is a separate concept and does not directly impact the MFP of the gas molecules.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation for the observed change in \(\lambda\) is that the electron beam ionizes the gas molecules, increasing their effective collision cross-section (\(\sigma\)). This increase in \(\sigma\) reduces the MFP of the gas molecules, leading to \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
