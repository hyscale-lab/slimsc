Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous, but I think I can figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that's a key point. The 1H NMR has six signals: two for aromatic H, two for vinyl H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two for CH3 groups. No CH2 signals, so no methylene groups in the structure.

First, I need to think about the structure. Since it's a di-substituted aromatic ring, there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The presence of an ester group suggests that one of the substituents is an ester. Ester groups are usually something like O-C-O, right? So maybe it's an ester like OAc (acetate) or something else.

Wait, but the NMR has two CH3 signals. Hmm. Esters typically have a methyl group from the acetyl part, like in an acetate. So if the substituent is an ester, that would account for one CH3. But the NMR has two signals for CH3. So perhaps there's another CH3 group elsewhere. Maybe another substituent on the benzene ring that has a CH3 group, like a methyl group attached directly or part of another functional group.

Wait, but the substituents on the ring could be an ester and another group. Let me think: di-substituted benzene with ester and another group. What would that other group look like? Maybe another ester? No, wait, but the NMR has two CH3 signals, so perhaps the substituents are an ester (like OAc) and a vinyl group or something else.

Wait, the NMR shows two CH3 groups. So maybe one is from the ester (like OAc) and the other is a methyl group attached to another part of the molecule. Alternatively, perhaps the other substituent is a methoxy group, but that's OCH3, which wouldn't have a CH3 signal because the O would split it. Wait, no, wait. No, methoxy would be OCH3, which is a singlet. But the CH3 in the NMR is a separate signal, so perhaps it's a methyl group attached to something else, like an oxygen or part of a double bond.

Let me think about the substituents. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, let's say the two substituents are an ester group and another group. Let's say the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group attached to something else, like maybe a methylene group but wait, the NMR doesn't show CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, but the NMR mentions two vinyl H. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl group. Wait, vinyl groups are CH2=CH–, but then that would have two H's. Wait, but in the NMR, the vinyl H's are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. That suggests some coupling between the two vinyl H's. Maybe it's a group like CH2=CH– but that would have more than two H's. Wait, no, each CH2 would have two H's. Wait, no, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to another structure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester, and another substituent is a group that has a double bond with adjacent CH3 groups.

Wait, let me think about the possible structures. Since it's a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and another group that brings in some CH3 groups.

Wait, the molecular formula options are given. Let me look at them:

Options are:
A) C11H14O2
B) C12H14O2
C) C12H12O2
D) C11H12O2

The benzene ring itself is C6H6. If the substituents add up to x carbons, the total would be 6 + x. Let's see:

Looking for the substituents. Let's say one substituent is an ester group, like O
