Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. The glass has an index of refraction n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the laboratory frame, and the glass is moving towards them. Wait, no, the question says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, no, let me read that again.

"A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory."

Oh, wait. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. And the glass is moving towards the observer. So, the observer is in the lab, which is stationary, I suppose. The glass is moving with velocity v in the direction of the light beam and towards the observer. Hmm, maybe I should visualize this.

So, the glass is moving towards the observer, right? Because it's moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is approaching the observer. Or wait, maybe the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light. So, the glass is moving towards the observer as well.

The question is about the speed of the light beam relative to the observer. Wait, no, it's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh, right, because the glass is moving. So, in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light would be c/n (since speed in medium is c/n), and then we need to find how it transforms when the glass is moving.

But this is a problem involving relative velocity. So maybe I should think about the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because if the glass is moving at velocity v, and in its frame the light has speed c/n, then what is the speed in the lab frame?

Wait, but wait. The light is in the glass medium, so its speed in the glass's rest frame is v_light = c/n. Now, when the glass (and hence the medium) is moving at velocity u (v in this case) relative to the lab, we have to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab.

The standard velocity addition formula for relativity is (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame, v is the speed of the moving frame relative to the lab. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I get the frames right.

Wait, no. The observer is in the lab. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v, and the light inside the glass has a velocity u in the glass's frame. So to find the velocity of the light in the lab frame, we use the velocity addition formula, where u is the velocity in the glass frame, and v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab.

Wait, but the velocity addition formula applies when you have a frame S' moving at velocity v relative to frame S. So in this case, S is the lab frame, and S' is the glass frame. So the light's velocity in S' is u', and we need to find u in S.

So, according to the velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v) / c² )

Because the glass is moving at v relative to the lab, and the light in the glass frame is moving at u' = c/n.

So substituting, u = (c/n + v) / [1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v c)/(n c² ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So u = (c/(n) + v) / (1 + v/(n c) )

Hmm, but the options don't have anything with c in them. Wait, the problem takes c=1, so c=1. So substituting c=1, the expression becomes:

u = (1/n + v) / (1 + v/(n) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So that would be the speed. Looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So that's the first option.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the direction might matter. Because if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, that is, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, no, the light is propagating through the glass which is moving. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v in the direction of the light beam, meaning that the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So the velocity addition formula is applicable as I did before. So option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which would be correct.

Wait, another thought. Could this be a non-relativistic case? Because the problem doesn't specify that it's relativistic. But the options don't include 1/(n), which would be the speed in the rest frame. So perhaps the problem is in the realm of classical mechanics, where velocities just add up.

Wait, but if it's non-relativistic, then the speed of light in the lab would be (c/n + v), but only if v is much smaller than c, which is not the case here since c=1. But that's not any of the options. So probably it's relativistic.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves determining the speed of light in a glass medium relative to a laboratory observer, where the glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. The index of refraction of the glass is \( n \), and the speed of light in a vacuum is \( c = 1 \).

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( c/n \). To find the speed of light in the lab frame, we apply the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame.
- \( c = 1 \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Substituting \( u' = c/n \) and \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplifying the denominator \( 1 + \frac{v}{n} \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- Option B (\( 1 \)) is incorrect because it does not account for the medium or the motion of the glass.
- Option C (\( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \)) is incorrect because the denominator has the wrong sign.
- Option D (\( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \)) is incorrect because the numerator has the wrong sign.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
