Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my vacuum physics, but let me think this through.

The setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. But some gas particles are still there, and the mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? 

The mean free path (λ) is usually calculated using the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. Or wait, another version is λ = (1) / (n * π * d² * sqrt(2)), where n is the number density. Oh right, and n is proportional to pressure over temperature because PV = nRT, so n = P/(k*T). So if pressure goes down, λ increases.

So initially, when the vacuum is created, the pressure is P, and the mean free path is λ1. But then when the electron beam is turned on, Mike observes a change in the mean free path to λ2. The question is, what's the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

Wait, why would the mean free path change? The pressure hasn't changed, right? Because the pumps are running, and the temperature is the same. Or wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, it heats the gas molecules or something? Or perhaps the beam causes the gas to ionize or something else.

Oh, wait, the problem states that the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So temperature isn't changing. So factors like thermal expansion shouldn't affect it. So if pressure is the same, and temperature is the same, why does the mean free path change?

Wait, maybe the electron beam is causing some effect on the gas. Like, perhaps the electrons are interacting with the gas molecules. When the electron beam is on, it's possible that the electrons collide more frequently with the gas molecules. But wait, the mean free path is a measure of how far a molecule travels before a collision. So if the beam is on, perhaps the electrons are causing more scattering of the gas molecules, which would change the effective mean free path for the electrons in the beam, or for the gas molecules themselves.

Wait no, the mean free path for the gas molecules would be determined by their own collisions, not by the electrons. Unless the electron beam is causing the gas to ionize or something, which would change the behavior.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be knocked out of the compartment, but that would change the pressure, but the question says the temperature is the same, implying pressure hasn't changed. Or wait, maybe the electron beam causes some gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which could change their effective diameter d, thus affecting the mean free path.

Hmm, but the formula for the mean free path is λ = 1/(n π d² sqrt(2)), so if d increases (because the molecules are ionized and maybe larger in diameter), then λ would decrease. So if d goes up, then
