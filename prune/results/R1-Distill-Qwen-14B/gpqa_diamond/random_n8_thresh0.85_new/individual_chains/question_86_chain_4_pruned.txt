Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure it out. Alright, the question is about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents on unknown compounds. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, actually, looking again, one reaction gives (R) and the other gives (S), but looking at the question, I think each reaction produces a specific enantiomer. 

Wait, the first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ gives (R)-4-ethyl... and the second is B + BH3 + H+ gives (S)-4-ethyl... So, the same product but different configurations? Or wait, maybe the product is the same but the starting material's configuration affects the outcome. Hmm.

Wait no, wait. Let me read it again: "Select the proper starting material for both of the reactions." So each reaction (A and B) produces a different enantiomer of the same product. So the starting materials must be different enantiomers of something, right?

So the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I think this is a cyclic ketone. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen, like a cyclic ether. So 2H-pyran-2-one would have the ketone at position 2. So the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and a ketone group at
