Alright, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules is important for understanding their structure and properties. C3h symmetry... wait, what does that mean? Oh right, the C3h point group. From what I recall, C3h has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a mirror plane (σ) that's perpendicular to the C3 axis. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and have that mirror plane.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.
Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.
Option C: triisopropyl borate.
Option D: quinuclidine.

Let me think about each structure.

Triphenyleno[...]trifuran... that probably has three benzene rings attached in some way. Wait, the way the substituents are attached might influence the symmetry. If it's symmetric around the central tricyclic structure, maybe it has higher symmetry.

Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a [3.3.1]bicyclo structure. I remember quinuclidine has a threefold axis of rotation. Because it's a bridged tricyclic compound, perhaps it has C3 symmetry. But does it have the mirror plane needed for C3h? Hmm.

Triisopropyl borate. The structure is a borate with three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are symmetric themselves, arranged around the central boron. So the molecule is probably trigonal planar around the boron. Wait, but trigonal planar is D3h symmetry, which is higher than C3h. Or wait, no, D3h includes a C3 axis and three mirror planes. But I'm not sure if triisopropyl borate has that. Maybe it's just C3 because of the threefold rotation. But I'm not certain.

Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... that's a structure with three benzene rings attached to a central furan ring? Or maybe it's a tricyclic system with benzene rings fused in a certain way. The way the substituents are arranged might affect the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find a molecule that has a threefold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it. Quinuclidine is a tricyclic structure. Let me visualize it. Quinuclidine has a bridged structure, so when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. But does it have a mirror plane? I think it does. Because if you draw a plane through the bridge, perhaps that's a mirror plane. So C3h symmetry would fit here.

Triisopropyl borate: three isopropyl groups around a central atom. Each isopropyl is symmetric, but the molecule would have a threefold axis. Do the mirror planes exist? Let me think. Each isopropyl is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So the overall structure is symmetric in the plane perpendicular to the C3 axis, which would imply a mirror plane. So triisopropyl borate might have D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. Wait, but wait, D3h has more symmetry elements. So if the molecule has three mirror planes and a C3 axis, then it's D3h. But if it only has one mirror plane (the one perpendicular to C3), then it's C3h. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule. The central B is bonded to three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl is a substituent that's symmetric. So the molecule would have a threefold rotation axis (C3) and mirror planes that include that axis. So in that case, it's D3h symmetry, not C3h. Because D3h has multiple mirror planes. So that wouldn't be the correct answer here.

Looking back at quinuclidine. Its structure is bicyclic with a bridge. Let me draw it mentally. It's a bicyclo[3.3.1] structure. The molecule has a threefold rotation axis through the bridge. Now, does it have any mirror planes? If you slice through the bridge, that could be a mirror plane. So the molecule would have a C3 axis and a σ (mirror) plane perpendicular to it. That would make it C3h symmetry. So quinuclidine could be the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let's see.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran... I'm not entirely sure about the structure, but if it's a tricyclic system with benzene rings attached, perhaps it doesn't have the right symmetry. Maybe it's more like a tricyclo with three benzene rings fused, but I'm not certain. Unless it has a threefold symmetry, but I think it's more likely to have lower symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno... I'm not exactly sure about the structure. It might have three phenyl groups attached to a central ring. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, perhaps it has C3h symmetry as well. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. Which of these compounds is known for having a threefold axis and a mirror plane?

Quinuclidine: I think it has a C3 axis and a mirror plane. So C3h.

Triphenyleno… I'm not certain, but perhaps not.

Benzo… probably lower symmetry.

So the correct answer should be D) quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry elements required for this point group: a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to the C₃ axis. Each option is evaluated based on its structure and symmetry:

1. **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**  
   This molecule has a complex tricyclic structure with three phenyl groups attached to a central ring system. While it may exhibit some symmetry, it does not clearly possess a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it. Thus, it likely does not have C₃h symmetry.

2. **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**  
   This molecule is a tricyclic system with benzene rings fused to a central furan ring. Its symmetry is likely lower due to the arrangement of the fused rings, and it does not exhibit the required C₃h symmetry.

3. **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**  
   This molecule has three isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around a central boron atom. It has a threefold rotation axis (C₃) but also has three mirror planes, which would make it **D₃h** symmetry, not **C₃h**. Therefore, it does not match the required symmetry.

4. **Option D: Quinuclidine**  
   Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.3.1] structure with a threefold rotation axis (C₃) passing through the bridge. It also has a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to the C₃ axis. This combination of symmetry elements makes it consistent with **C₃h** symmetry.

Based on the analysis, **quinuclidine** is the molecule with C₃h symmetry.

**Answer: D**
