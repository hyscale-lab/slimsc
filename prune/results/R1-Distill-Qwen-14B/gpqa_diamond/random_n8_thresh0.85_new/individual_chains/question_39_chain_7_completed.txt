Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

So, we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when measuring the position, none of the particles were found at x<1 or x>3. So, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. The question is to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the probabilities must add up to 1.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Since it's a wave function, I think the time dependence is probably not an issue here, and we're looking at the spatial part. Oh, but wait, the wave function is a complex number. But for normalization, we take the absolute value squared, which is the same as the square of the modulus.

So, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5)i. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Wait, when calculating the modulus squared, |ψ|², that's [a/(sqrt(1+x))]² + (-0.5)^2. Because for a complex number a + ib, |a+ib|² = a² + b².

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Now, the normalization condition is the integral of |ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, because the particle is only found between 1 and 3. So I set up the integral:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me split the integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to 3 + Integral [0.25 dx] from 1 to 3 = 1.

Calculate each part separately.

First integral: ∫ [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 1+x, so du = dx. When x=1, u=2; when x=3, u=4.

So the integral becomes a² ∫ (1/u) du from 2 to 4. The integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so:

a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Wait, because ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first integral is a² ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Putting it together:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Wait, no. Because the integral of |ψ|² is 1, so:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the modulus squared is real part squared plus imaginary part squared, which is correct.

Wait another thought: is the wave function ψ(x) given correctly? Because the wave function should be a function that when squared and integrated gives 1. So if the wave function is a complex constant plus some real function, that's okay as long as the integral works out.

Hmm, but wait, the way the wave function is written is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That is, it's a function with a real part varying with x and a constant imaginary part. That's a bit unusual because typically the wave function might have both real and imaginary parts varying with x, but in this case, the imaginary part is a constant. So the modulus squared is (a²/(1+x) ) + (0.5)^2. So that's correct.

So the integration is as I did before, and I think I didn't make a mistake in that part.

Wait, but wait another thought: if the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the imaginary part is a constant, not dependent on x. So when we integrate, the second term in the modulus squared is 0.25, a constant. So the integral over x from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1)=0.5, which is correct.

So the calculation of a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = 0.5/(ln2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. So the option B is 0.85, which matches.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the integral of the modulus squared of the wave function over all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1
\]

### First Integral: \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \)

Using the substitution \( u = 1+x \), \( du = dx \), the limits change from \( x = 1 \) (\( u = 2 \)) to \( x = 3 \) (\( u = 4 \)). The integral becomes:

\[
a^2 \int_{2}^{4} \frac{1}{u} du = a^2 \left[\ln(u)\right]_{2}^{4} = a^2 \ln\left(\frac{4}{2}\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral: \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \)

This is straightforward:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining the Results

Adding the two integrals and setting the sum equal to 1:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

### Final Answer

The value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
