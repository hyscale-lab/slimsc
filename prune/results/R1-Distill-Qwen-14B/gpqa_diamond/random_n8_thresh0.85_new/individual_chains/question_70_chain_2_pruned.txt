Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. 

Hmm, I remember that molecular symmetry groups are about the different types of symmetry a molecule has. These groups are part of the larger symmetry classification, like point groups. Common ones include C2, which has a 2-fold rotation axis; D4h, which is a higher symmetry group with multiple axes and planes; D∞h is like a higher symmetry with an infinite-fold rotation axis (like in benzene rings); and C2v has a 2-fold rotation and a vertical mirror plane.

So, let's try to break down the reactions given to figure out what each substance might be. Once I know what E is, I can determine its symmetry.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I'm trying to think of bright red products. Maybe something like sulfur? Or perhaps a transition metal compound. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving SO3 or something else. Wait, another common bright red product is mercury(II) oxide, but that's red. Or perhaps it's a transition metal complex. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction involving multiple atoms. Let's think about the stoichiometry. 8 equivalents of B per A. That's a lot. Maybe A is something that forms a complex with B in an 8:1 ratio. For example, perhaps A is iron metal (Fe) and B is sulfur (S), but that doesn't fit exactly. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas. Wait, 8 equivalents could mean that each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B. So, maybe A is Fe, and B is Cl2? Hmm, but 8 Cl2 per Fe would make FeCl8, but that's not a common compound. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide or something else.

Wait, another angle. Let's look at reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is reacted with water, it produces A, F, and G. Strong acid and weak acid. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids include H2O (but that's not an acid), maybe acetic acid or something. Wait, but F and G are products when C is hydrolyzed.

So, C must be some kind of salt that, when it reacts with water, breaks down into A, F, and G. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide reacting with water to produce H2S (weak acid) and something else. Wait, but if C is a sulfide, like FeS, reacting with water (though usually FeS reacts with water to produce H2S and Fe(OH)2, which isn't very stable). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or another compound.

Let me think about reaction 2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Gas D reacting with C in a 2:1 ratio. Hmm, what gases could D be? Let's think: D could be a diatomic gas like O2, Cl2, or maybe H2. But if D is Cl2, reacting with C (maybe a metal chloride) would produce some product. Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is something like phosgene, or sarin gas? No, not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let me try to think of each step and see if I can find a common reaction.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Solid A, gas B forms bright red C.

Potential bright red products: maybe copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate is blue. Iron(III) oxide is reddish. Oh, mercury(II) oxide is a bright red solid. So, if A is HgO, but wait, what would B be? HgO reacting with 8 equivalents of something. Alternatively, perhaps C is a product with a lot of atoms. Wait, another thought: maybe A is sulfur (S8), and B is O2. But S8 reacting with O2 gives SO3? Not sure.

Alternatively, if A is Fe, but Fe + O2 would form FeO or Fe3O4, which is black or reddish. Hmm, not bright red. Or perhaps C is a transition metal complex. Wait, maybe C is a hexaaqua ion or something else.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is the formation of a sulfide. Wait, A is solid, B is gas. Maybe A is Fe and B is S. Fe reacts with S to form FeS, but that's a dark compound, not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps A is Cu and B is S. Cu reacts with S to form CuS, which is black.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's look at reaction 3 again: C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, when C is hydrolyzed, it releases a strong acid and a weak acid. That makes me think of a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids. For example, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's think: if C is NH4NO3, but that's a nitrate, not a nitride. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. If C is a sulfide, like FeS, but FeS is a solid, and when it reacts with water, it produces H2S (weak acid) and Fe(OH)2 (which is a base, but maybe it decomposes further). Wait, but that would produce a weak acid and a base, not two acids.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a metal carbonate. For example, if C is CaCO3, then reacting with water (though it's not very reactive) would produce Ca(OH)2, CO2, and H2O. Wait, but that's producing a base and a gas. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride. If C is a nitride like AlN, reacting with water would produce NH3 (a weak base) and Al(OH)3. Hmm, that's a base and another base. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. If C is Na2SO3, reacting with water (but it's already in water?), perhaps acidifying it would produce H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, weak acid) and NaOH. But that doesn't fit exactly either.

Alternatively, maybe C is a chloride. For example, if C is CaCl2, reacting with water would just give Ca(OH)2 and HCl. But HCl is a strong acid, and Ca(OH)2 is a base. So F would be HCl (strong acid), and G would be... well, maybe it's not another acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonate? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. If C is a metal oxide, like Na2O, reacting with water would produce NaOH, which is a strong base, not acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should think about reaction 2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, what reaction produces a dangerous product when a salt reacts with a gas? Maybe D is a halogen, like Cl2. If C is something like NH3, but that's a gas. Alternatively, if C is a sulfide and D is Cl2, maybe they react to form HCl and S, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another thought: when C is a metal sulfide, and D is Cl2, perhaps they react to form HCl and S. But that's not likely. Alternatively, if C is a metal nitride, and D is H2O, but that's not a gas.

Wait, let me think of the other reaction given: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D and B combine in a 1:1 ratio to make H, a solvent. Common solvents include water (H2O), ethanol, etc. But D and B are both gases. So what gases combine in a 1:1 ratio to form a common solvent?
