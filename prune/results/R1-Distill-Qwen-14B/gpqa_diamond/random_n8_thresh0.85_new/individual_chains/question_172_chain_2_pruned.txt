Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I think means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the stars' photospheres are in LTE, which probably means we can use the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, right, the Boltzmann factor. The population of energy levels depends on temperature. The formula I remember is the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor of the energy difference divided by k*T. So, the formula is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, if E2 is higher than E1, then n2 is less than n1. So, the ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

In this question, the excited state is the higher energy level. So, let's say star_1 has n1 atoms in that level, and star_2 has n2. The problem states that n1 is twice n2. So, n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, wait, no, wait. It says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, maybe n1 (excited level) is higher in star_1. So for star_1, the number is higher. So n1 = 2 * n2. Or, perhaps, the ratio between star_1 and star_2's populations is 2, so n1/n2 = 2.

So, according to the Boltzmann distribution, n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )? Wait, no, because each star has its own temperature. Wait, wait, no. For each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or whatever the other level is) depends on that star's temperature.

Wait, wait, the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. So, the ratio of the populations for each star, comparing the excited level to some lower level, which we'll call the ground state. Let me denote for star_1: n1_excited / n1_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), and for star_2: n2_excited / n2_ground = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). But wait, the problem says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, the total number of iron atoms in each star's photosphere might vary, but perhaps we can consider the ratio of excited to ground as what's given. Or maybe the ratio of the excited states is 2:1 between the two stars.

Wait, the problem states, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that in star_2's. Wait, but the number could also depend on the total number of iron atoms. But perhaps the question is about the ratio of the populations in each star, so for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is what's important.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the excited level in star_1 to the excited level in star_2 that's 2. So, (n1_excited / n1_ground) / (n2_excited / n2_ground) ) = 2. Or maybe it's just n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited.

Wait, but without knowing the total number of atoms, we can't directly say that. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is comparing the same energy levels in each star. So, for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is determined by their respective temperatures.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as:

For star_1: (n1_excited) / (n1_ground) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

For star_2: (n2_excited) / (n2_ground) ) = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

But the problem says that n1_excited = 2 * n2_excited. Hmm, but that might not be correct because we don't know the ratio of the total number of atoms or the ground state populations. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the excited state populations in the two stars, considering that each star's own ratio is determined by their temperatures.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of the excited state population in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2. So, n1_excited / n2_excited = 2.

If that's the case, then (n
