Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through each part.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a cage structure. The 1,3-dibromo would mean there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons in the structure. When you heat it with excess KOH, that's typically an elimination reaction. Oh wait, but wait, KOH with dibromides usually leads to elimination, probably forming an alkene. So, the first step is dehydrohalogenation.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? Because there are two Br atoms. So, the product would be an adamantane with a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions. Wait, but in adamantane, the positions are arranged in a way that maybe the double bond would form a bridge or something. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, because when two adjacent (vicinal) bromides are present, elimination forms a double bond between those carbons. So the product after step one is 1,3-adamantene? Or maybe the double bond is between carbons that were 1 and 3 in the original structure, but in a bridged structure. Hmm.

The product 1 is a light yellow solid. The NMR data: 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's a singlet maybe? Or a doublet? Wait, the integration is 2H. Since the product is formed via elimination, perhaps it's an alkene, but wait, wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh, wait a minute! So maybe the product isn't an alkene but an epoxide? Or maybe a ketone? Hmm. Wait, wait, because when you have a dihalide and use a strong base like KOH, sometimes it can lead to elimination but if there's another possibility, like forming a carbonyl group. Wait, or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but in this case, maybe the structure leads to a cyclic ketone?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. When 1,3-dibromohexane is treated with KO
