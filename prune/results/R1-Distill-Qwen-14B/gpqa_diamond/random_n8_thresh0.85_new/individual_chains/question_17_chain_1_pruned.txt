Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The problem states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its correct form to bind the metal effectively. The temperature is 25°C, which I guess is standard, but I don't think that affects this particular calculation. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to relate the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex to the concentration of free Ca²+ ions. Because EDTA forms a complex with Ca²+, making the free ion concentration low.

Wait, the formation constant K is for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA combine to form the complex. The reaction would look something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Yeah, so the formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in the solution, are we assuming that all the EDTA is in the form that can bind calcium? I think the problem says pH is ideal, so maybe EDTA is fully deprotonated, so the only EDTA species present is the one that can
