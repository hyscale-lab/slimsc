Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

Alright, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25 °C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12.

I remember that orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion. So, the solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. These are phosphate buffers, right? Because they are a weak acid and its conjugate base.

Wait, KH2PO4 is a diprotic acid. Let me think. H3PO4 can lose three protons. So, H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). So, KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- with K+ as the counterion. And Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- with Na+.

When you mix these two, they form a buffer solution with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the buffer components. The pH of the solution will be determined by the pKa2, I think. Because H2PO4^- is the acid (can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

So the buffer equation is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA]). A^- is HPO4^2-, and HA is H2PO4^-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but actually, the orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-. So, the concentration we're looking for is [HPO4^2-]. But maybe I need to find the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- and then compute the concentrations?

First, let's calculate the moles of each component.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007344 mol. Wait, 1/136.09 is about 0.007344... let me compute 1.00 / 136.09. Let's see, 136.09 * 0.007344 is approximately 1. So that's correct.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 /177.99 ≈ 0.005612 mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol, so 1g is about 0.005612 moles.

So, in solution, each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^- and 1 mole of K+. Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives 1 mole of HPO4^2- and 2 moles of Na+. The water of crystallization probably doesn't affect the ion concentration in solution, so I can ignore that for now.

So, total moles of H2PO4^- is 0.007344 mol, and moles of HPO4^2- is 0.005612 mol.

The total volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L.

So concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.007344 / 0.2 = 0.03672 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.005612 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

Now, the H-H equation: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

The Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207. Let me compute that: log(6.2)=0.792, so 8-0.792=7.208 approximately. Wait, wait, no: (6.2e-8) is 6.2 x 10^-8. So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.207.

So, plugging into the Henderson equation: pH = 7.207 + log(0.02806 / 0.03672).

Let me compute the ratio: 0.02806 / 0.03672 ≈ 0.7648.

Log(0.7648) is about -0.115.

So pH ≈ 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092.

Wait, but wait, do I need the pH for calculating the concentration? Hmm, maybe not. Because the question is about [HPO4^2-]. But wait, perhaps I can find the ratio and then find the concentrations.

Wait, but the buffer equation tells me the pH, but how does that help me find the concentration of HPO4^2-? Because the ratio is determined by the moles, but under the solution conditions, maybe there's some dissociation.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Because H2PO4^- can dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can dissociate into H+ and PO4^3-.

But since the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, it's a buffer. The pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which I used earlier.

But the question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-. So, without any additional reactions, because the solution is a buffer, the concentrations are determined by the initial amounts and the buffer equation.

Wait, but I think I have to account for the fact that HPO4^2- might further dissociate into PO4^3-.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-. So, in the solution, due to the buffer action, the main species present are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But
