Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think through it.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite rigid. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base. I'm thinking about elimination reactions here. Since there are two leaving groups (Br), maybe an E2 mechanism could occur. Wait, but for elimination, you need a base to abstract a proton that's anti to the leaving group.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide? No, wait, vicinal is adjacent carbons. 1 and 3 are separated by one carbon in adamantane. So maybe it's a 1,3-dibromide, which is not vicinal but maybe in a structure that allows for elimination.

Wait, when dihalides undergo elimination with a strong base like KOH, they can form alkenes. So perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, leading to the formation of an alkene.

In the product, I see that the IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the product must have a ketone group. Hmm, so maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Wait, could it be a Hofmann elimination? No, that's for forming amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then how does that lead to a ketone?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Let's think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. Another possibility is that it's a double elimination, but perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to a double bond, or maybe it's a substitution. But substituting two bromines would require two substitution reactions, which might not likely happen under such conditions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for cyclic ketones and esters.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a cycloalkane with a double bond. But wait, in the product, the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the dihalide is converted into a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe when two bromides are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond, but if the structure is such that elimination forms a conjugated diene, but that doesn't directly lead to a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps if one of the Br leaves and another part of the molecule forms a carbonyl.

Wait, another reaction comes to mind: the formation of epoxides from dihalides. No, that's when you have two adjacent halogens and you form an epoxide with a base. But the product here has a ketone.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of a diketone, but that doesn't make sense because we're starting with two bromines. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination with a base, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm region is usually around where protons adjacent to oxygen or in an ether might be. But with the IR showing a carbonyl, it's more likely a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but that would show a broad peak around 1-5 ppm.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group next to an oxygen, like a CH₂-O, such as in an ether or a carbonyl group. For a ketone, perhaps it's a secondary alcohol that has been oxidized, but that would require more specific conditions.

Wait, another approach: looking at the product structure. Let's think about 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH. Maybe it's a double elimination. Each Br could leave, and the molecule loses HBr twice, forming a double bond. But how would that form a carbonyl group?

Wait, perhaps it's a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a beta-hydroxy dihalide elimination. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, considering the structure, adamantane is a cage-like structure, so the 1 and 3 positions would be on adjacent carbons in the structure. So, perhaps when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the adjacent C-C bonds form a double bond. But how does that lead to a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the KO
