Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, I think I should first figure out what the structure of the compound is. 

So 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, maybe I misread that. It's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, the way it's written is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, perhaps 'd' stands for deuterium? Or maybe it's a typo. Wait, wait, the problem says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which probably is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because sometimes, the notation can be a bit tricky. Wait no, 2-d implies a single deuterium substitution? Or maybe it's 2,4-dimethyl? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure here. 

Wait, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1, and a deuterium (d) at position 2? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. Wait, no, the 'd' is lowercase, so perhaps it's a single deuterium. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the
