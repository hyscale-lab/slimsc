Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, it's an aromatic compound like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, like a strong peak around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl. So, that tells me there's an ester in the molecule.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me list them out:

1. Two aromatic H signals. Wait, di-substituted benzene. If it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons are typically two sets (each pair), leading to maybe two doublets or a doublet of doublets. But the problem says two signals, so maybe two protons each? Like, perhaps each substituent is in a position that leads to two sets of aromatic Hs.

2. Two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl Hs are adjacent to double bonds, so maybe there are substituents like an ester group attached to the ring with a vinyl group. For example, an ester like OCOOR where the R has a double bond, like maybe a substituted ethylene group.

3. Two signals for -CH3 groups. So, two methyl groups somewhere. They could be adjacent to the ester or part of a substituent on the ring.

No signals for -CH2 groups. So maybe all the CH2 groups are either not present or perhaps not split into observable signals, but more likely, the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups. So, the substituents on the benzene are such that they don't contain any CH2.

Putting this together, since it's a di-substituted benzene, maybe each substituent is an ester group? Wait, but that would make it a di-ester, but that might not explain the vinyl and methyl groups.

Alternatively, if one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, but that seems less likely since the IR shows an ester. Wait, the IR shows the presence of an ester, but maybe there's another functional group too... or maybe it's an ester and something else.

Wait, another thought: the vinyl Hs. Vinyl groups are like CH2=CH–, but wait, if the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group, like maybe an allyl ester or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester.

Wait, vinyl Hs would be in a double bond. So, for example, if one substituent is an ester group attached via a vinyl group, like OCO–CH2–CH2–? No, that wouldn't have vinyl Hs. Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group. Like OCO–CH2–CH2– something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group attached to the ring. But wait, vinyl groups are usually part of a substituent like CH2=CH– attached to the ring, but that might lead to some deshielded protons.

Wait, but the substituent itself might have a double bond. For example, if one substituent is a methyl group attached to an ester, and the other substituent is a vinyl group. But wait, let's think about the NMR signals.

In the NMR, there are two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. That suggests that each vinyl proton is coupled with another. Hmm, perhaps it's a trans configuration, where each vinyl H is next to another, so each is a doublet. But if one is a doublet and the other is a quartet, maybe one is split by two neighboring protons and the other by another. Wait, a doublet of quartets would be splitting into four peaks, so perhaps each H is coupled with two others. That might suggest a more complex structure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the structure. The aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester group (O-CO-O), but wait, no, an ester is O-CO-O-R, right? So, the substituent would be O-CO-O-R, perhaps. Or, maybe it's an ester group attached via an oxygen, but that's getting a bit fuzzy.

Wait, if the substituent is an ester, the structure would be something like benzene-O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. But in that case, R could have a vinyl group and methyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group. Like O-CO-CH2-CH2-O-R? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like CH2=CHCOOR, but that's getting complicated.

Let me think about the NMR signals again. The aromatic Hs: two signals, which might indicate that the two substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic Hs to split into two sets. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic Hs would be in two sets of two each, giving two signals. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, you might get three signals, but the question says two. So perhaps the substituents are in para positions, making the aromatic Hs have two sets of two protons each.

The vinyl Hs: two signals. Maybe each from a different position in a substituted double bond.

The CH3 groups: two signals. So, perhaps two different methyl groups. So maybe one methyl is attached to an oxygen, like OCH3, and another is a regular CH3. Or perhaps they are in different chemical environments.

Wait, but no signals for CH2. So, the molecule doesn
