Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about a problem in a transgenic mouse model experiment where they're trying to overexpress the GADD45G protein. They introduced an influenza hemagglutinin sequence at the N-terminus, but the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. The task is to find out why based on the provided DNA sequence.

First, I need to look at the DNA sequence provided. The plus strand is given, so I should note the sequence and see what's going on. Let me look for any obvious issues.

The provided DNA sequence starts with a 5' ATG, which is the start codon, methionine. That's good because it's the beginning of the coding sequence. So the gene should be expressed.

Looking further, after the ATG, the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, but they added the hemagglutinin (HA) sequence at the N-terminus. I'm not sure what the HA sequence is, but it's a short peptide, maybe around 10 amino acids. So the first few codons should be the HA tag.

Wait, but maybe the HA tag is added as a DNA sequence, and perhaps there's a mistake in the reading frame or a stop codon introduced. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the inserted HA sequence includes some stop codons or is in the wrong reading frame, causing the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the DNA sequence after the ATG, it's ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA... Wait, I see a TGA in there. Wait, TGA is a stop codon in DNA terms? Wait, no. Wait, DNA is read as the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary. So the plus strand is the sense strand, so in mRNA, T becomes U. So looking for UAA, UAG, or UGA in the mRNA.

Wait, let's find any stop codons in the sequence. Let me scan through the DNA sequence to see if any of the triplets are TAA, TAG, or TGA, because those would be the stop codons on the plus strand (since mRNA is complementary, but wait no: the mRNA is made from the template strand, which is the complement of the plus strand. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think.

The plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA is a copy of this strand. So any TGA on the plus strand would translate into TGA on the mRNA, which is a stop codon. Similarly, TAA becomes UAA, TAG becomes UAG.

So let me go through the sequence and check for any of these triplets.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Hmm, I see a TAC which is Tyr, then CCA is Pro, TAC is Tyr again. Next is GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), CCA (Pro), GAT (Asp), TAC (Tyr), GCC (Ala), AAA (Lys), TGA (stop codon?) Oh wait! I see TGA here: the sequence is ...AAA TGA...

So in the DNA, the plus strand has a TGA triplet, which on the mRNA would be UGA, a stop codon. So that's a problem. Because the ribosome would translate this as a stop signal, leading to premature termination of the protein synthesis.

So the HA tag was added, but perhaps the inserted sequence introduced a premature stop codon. Alternatively, maybe the HA sequence was inserted incorrectly, leading to a frameshift that caused an early stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the coding sequence should begin with HA, then GADD45G. If in the plus strand, the HA sequence is followed by GADD45G, but if the HA has a stop codon, then the protein won't be expressed correctly.

Wait, in the given sequence, the HA would be the beginning, right after the ATG. Let me see: the first few codons are ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G...

Wait, let's think about this. The HA tag is probably a short peptide, like YPYDHHGQY (something like that), so the DNA would encode that. So maybe the HA sequence is correctly added, but then later in the construct, there's a TGA, which is a stop codon in the coding sequence.

Wait, but the given DNA sequence after the initial part has a TGA. So after the ATG, which is the start, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), etc., but then at position ...AAA TGA... that's a stop codon. So that's a problem.

So the DNA has a TGA in the middle of the coding sequence, which would cause the ribosome to stop translating, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all since the ribosome may terminate early.

So why is there a TGA in the coding sequence? Perhaps it's a mistake in the plasmid construction. Maybe during the cloning, a stop codon was introduced.

So the problem is that the construct includes a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early, leading to no overexpression of the protein. So the answer would be option B, the ribosome terminated early.

Wait, but let me check the options:

Option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would fit.

Another option is option D, which says the tRNA for UAA doesn't exist. Wait, but the stop codon here is TGA, which would be UGA in mRNA. So that's a different scenario.

Wait, the issue is that the stop codon is present. So that's the problem.

So the correct answer should be B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model fails to overexpress the GADD45G protein, despite introducing an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand reveals a premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence. This stop codon would be translated into UGA in the mRNA, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early. As a result, the protein is either truncated or not expressed at all, explaining the lack of overexpression.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**: This is unlikely because the issue lies in the premature stop codon, not in the HA tag sequence itself.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early**: This is correct, as the premature stop codon (TGA) in the DNA sequence would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, preventing full-length protein expression.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**: There is no evidence in the sequence provided to suggest proteolysis is occurring.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**: This is irrelevant because the stop codon in the mRNA is UGA, not UAA.

The presence of the TGA stop codon in the coding sequence is the primary issue, making **B** the correct answer.

Answer: B
