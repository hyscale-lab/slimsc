Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, wait. I think the formation constant, K, is given by K = [CaY²⁻]/([Ca²+][Y⁴−]), where Y⁴− is the EDTA^4- ion. Oh right, because the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

But wait, in the solution, the Ca-EDTA complex is at 0.02 M. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²⁻] is 0.02 M. Because the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution, which I think means that all the calcium and EDTA are in the complex form. Or maybe not? Wait no, because EDTA can be in different protonated forms depending on pH, but the question says the pH is ideal, so I guess the EDTA is in the form Y^4−. Oh wait, no, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and at certain pH conditions, it's deprotonated. But the problem says pH is ideal, which probably means that all the EDTA is in the Y^4− form. So I can ignore any other protonated forms.

So, the initial solution is 0.02 M CaY²−. So, from that, what's the concentration of free Ca²+ and Y^4−? Well, in the solution, the concentrations of Ca²+ and Y^4− should be equal because the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one Y^4−.

Let me think. The formation constant K is given as 5x10^10. So, K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). Since the solution is 0.02 M CaY²−, and assuming that the dissociation is minimal, then [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] = x. So plugging into the equation:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) => 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So, 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → x² = 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13)= 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5 → Wait, 4e-13 is 4 *10^-13. Square root is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13)=2 *1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-
