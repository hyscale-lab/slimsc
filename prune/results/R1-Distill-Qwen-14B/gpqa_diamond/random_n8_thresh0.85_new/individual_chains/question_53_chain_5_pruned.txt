Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So, that's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR has peaks for an ester group. So, the compound must have an ester functional group somewhere. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen, right? So the formula will have O2, maybe, because esters are usually O-containing.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let me break those down:

- Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern might be influencing the splitting. In a benzene ring with two substituents, depending on their positions, the protons can be in different environments. For example, if the substituents are para, there would be two sets of aromatic protons, maybe a doublet and a quartet or something else. Wait, but the question says two signals. So maybe the substituents are in positions that create two distinct sets, like para. Or maybe it's ortho, but that might lead to more splitting. Hmm.

- Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are CH2=CH- maybe. Wait, but the signals are for vinyl-H, so perhaps it's an ester group with a vinyl substituent. Like maybe an allyl ester or something with a double bond adjacent to the ester. So perhaps the structure is something like benzene ring with an ester group attached, which is connected to a vinyl group.

- Two signals for –CH3 groups. So there are two different types of methyl groups. Or maybe two sets of methyl groups. Wait, but the question says two signals, each corresponding to –CH3. So maybe one is a singlet and another is a triplet or something? Alternatively, maybe they are attached in different environments.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't have any signals for –CH2 groups. So the compound doesn't have any CH2 groups. That's an important clue. So any CH2 groups must be absent. So, if there's a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOO..., but that would have CH2 groups. Hmm, but wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond. But in that case, the NMR would show peaks for those CH2 groups. But the question says there are no CH2 signals. So maybe the vinyl group is part of the ring, like a substituted ring with a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a ring with alternating double bonds. Unless there's a substituent with a double bond, but not part of the ring.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group, but connected in such a way that there are no CH2 groups. Let me think about the typical ester structure. An ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, if one substituent is an ester (like O-CO-O-R), but that's not possible. Wait, no, the ester is an acyloxy group. So, if the substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, but that's actually a carbonate. Oh wait, no, an ester is an acyloxy group, like O-CO-R. So, perhaps the structure is benzene with an ester substituent. But where is the vinyl group?

Wait, maybe the substituents are an ester and a vinyl group. But the vinyl would be CH2=CHCOO-, but that would have a CH2 group, right? Unless the vinyl is at the end, like part of a substituent that's attached via a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are an ester and a group that doesn't have any CH2. For example, maybe the ester is connected to a benzyl group or something else.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again. There are two CH3 signals. So two different methyl groups. Perhaps one is a methyl ester, like O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, that's an ethyl ester. Or maybe O-CO-OCH3, which is a methyl ester. But that would only account for a single CH3 group. Unless there's another methyl group somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with an ester group and a substituent that has a vinyl group attached to another methyl group. For example, an ester attached to the ring, and another substituent that's a vinyl methyl group, like CH2=CH-O-R or something. Wait, but that might create CH2 groups.

Alternatively, the substituents could be a methyl ester and another group that has a vinyl group. Let me think about a possible structure.

Another approach: let's consider the possible options given.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2

B) C12H14O2

C) C12H12O2

D) C11H12O2

We need to figure out the molecular formula based on the structure.

Assuming a benzene ring (C6H5), then each substituent adds to the formula.

The ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, an ester is usually an acyloxy group. So for an ester, the formula would be O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. So the ester group is O-CO-O-R? No, wait, correcting myself: the ester functional group is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl. So if the benzene has an ester substituent, it would be O-CO-O-R attached to the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a COO-R group. So, for example, the benzene has -O-CO-O-R attached. But that's a carbonate, not an ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a COOR group, which is an ester. So, the benzene ring has a group like -O-CO-R attached. Wait, no, COOR is the ester. So, the substituent is a COO-R group, where R is an alkyl or aryl. So, for example, if R is CH2CH3, then the substituent is COOCH2CH3. Alternatively, R could be a phenyl group, but that's less likely in this case.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent would be a COO-R group, which would contribute to the molecular formula.

Let me think about the structure. The compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. One substituent is an ester group, maybe COOR, and the other substituent is a vinyl group or something else.

Wait, but the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH-. But in that case, the CH2 would be present, which would show up as a signal in the NMR. But the problem states that there are no signals for CH2 groups. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm. So maybe the substituent isn't a vinyl group in the way I'm thinking. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an allyl group, but that would have a CH2 as well.

Wait, another approach: perhaps one substituent is an ester group (COOR) and the other substituent is a group that has a double bond but without any CH2 groups. For example, maybe a substituent like CH2=CHCOOR, but that would have CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methylene group attached to the ring, but that's CH2, which would show up as a signal. But the NMR says no CH2 signals. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached via an oxygen, like an ether. But that would be -O-CH2-CH2- something, but that would have CH2 groups again.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the NMR signals in more detail.

The NMR has:

- Two aromatic protons (so two sets). Since the ring is di-substituted, the substituents could be para, leading to two sets of protons. For example, para-substituted ester and another group.

- Two vinyl protons: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically split into doublets because of coupling with adjacent protons. But a doublet of quartets suggests a more complex coupling. Maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like a double bond next to another double bond or an electronegative group.

- Two CH3 signals. So two different kinds of methyl groups. Maybe one is attached to the ester oxygen (like OCH3) and another is part of a substituent elsewhere.

Wait, but the ester is O-CO-O-R, so R would be an R group. If R is a methyl, then OCOOCH3 is a methyl ester. But then where is the vinyl H?

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a methyl ester (like COOCH3) and another group, maybe a vinyl group connected in a way that doesn't involve CH2.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a COOCH3 and a CH2CH2 group, but that brings back CH2 signals, which are not present.

This is tricky. Let me think about the molecular formula.

The options are:

A) C11H14O2 → Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, (2*11 +2 -14)/2 = (24-14)/2=5. Benzene ring (3 degrees), ester has a double bond (1), so that's 4, but 5 suggests another double bond or ring. Hmm.

B) C12H14O2 → (2*12 +2 -14
