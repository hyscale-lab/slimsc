Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, labeled A to D.

First, I'll look at the spectral data given. The IR and NMR data should help me figure out what the original compound, Compound X, is. Once I know that, I can determine what reaction it undergoes with red phosphorus and HI.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range. That's usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretches, but more likely O-H since I don't see any amine groups mentioned. Another peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe it's a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid derivative. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be around 2500-3000 cm-1 as a broad peak, and the carbonyl would be around 1700. But the 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad region, which suggests maybe an OH stretch. But then, if the compound has a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, but the IR data has 1720, which is a bit higher than a typical carboxylic acid (which is around 1700). So maybe it's an ester, which has a higher carbonyl stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Or perhaps an aldehyde, but aldehydes usually have a strong, sharp peak around 2820 and 2720 (stretching for the aldehyde CH) plus the carbonyl around 1720. But the IR data doesn't show those, so maybe it's not an aldehyde.

Other IR peaks: 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretches. So this compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Moving on to the NMR data. Let me list them:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. That's a strong indication of an acidic proton, like a phenolic OH or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be around 10-12 ppm, and it's usually a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, an aromatic OH could also be around 10 ppm. But if the compound is a benzoic acid derivative, that would make sense.

But wait, looking at the other peaks, I'll see if that makes sense.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is likely aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe it's part of a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, in a para-substituted aromatic compound, the ortho protons (two of them) would be a doublet due to coupling with each other.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, but lower downfield. So perhaps these are the other two aromatic protons in the para positions. Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene, each aromatic proton would be split into a doublet. So maybe this is a di-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions.

Wait, 8.0 and 7.2 ppm for two doublets each of 2H. That suggests a symmetrical substitution. For example, if the substituents are at para positions, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. So maybe it's a para-dimethyl group? Or perhaps a substituent that affects the ring differently.

Wait, but also, looking at the other NMR peaks: 

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Multiplet, integrating to one proton. That might be a CH group adjacent to something. Maybe a CH connected to an oxygen or a carbonyl. Like in a ketone or a secondary alcohol, but considering the IR data, maybe it's a carbonyl group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet integrating to two protons. These might be adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone, or part of a CH2 group near an electronegative atom.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): Doublet for three protons. That sounds like a methyl group attached to something that's next to another group. A common example is a methyl adjacent to a CH group, making a isopropyl or similar. Wait, a doublet for a methyl group—perhaps a CH(CH3) group, where the methyl is split into a doublet due to coupling with the neighboring CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for three protons, likely a terminal methyl group. So maybe a CH2CH2CH3... Wait, no. Triplet for 3H would be a methyl attached to a CH2, so something like CH2CH2CH3, but that would be a triplet. So perhaps an ethyl group: CH2CH3.

Wait, putting this together. Let's think about the NMR.

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents. For instance, if it's a para-dimethyl group, but the shifts would be different. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) and another is an electron-donating group (EDG). Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent with a carbonyl group attached.

Wait, but wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 1H. If that's a carboxylic acid proton, then the compound would be a benzoic acid derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm, but a bit higher. But aldehydes have sharp signals, while the 10.5 is a broad singlet, which is more like a carboxylic acid.

So if the compound is a benzoic acid, perhaps with substituents.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Suppose the benzene ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a -COOH group, and the other is an alkyl chain. Because the 10.5 ppm is the carboxylic acid proton, the aromatic protons adjacent to the COOH would be deshielded, appearing upfield.

Wait, but the aromatic protons in the NMR are 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm. Let me think about the substitution pattern.

Assuming the benzene ring has two substituents, say, a -COOR group and something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzyl ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H
