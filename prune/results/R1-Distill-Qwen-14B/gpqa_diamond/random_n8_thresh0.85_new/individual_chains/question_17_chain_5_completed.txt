Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. Hmm, I remember that K here probably refers to the stability constant for the complex ion.

Wait, so EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The complex is CaY²- where Y is the EDTA. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how stable the complex is. I think the formula involved here is Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, I might be mixing up the equations. Let me think more carefully.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that means the concentration of CaY²- is 0.02 M. Because it's a 1:1 complex (each Ca²+ binds to one EDTA), the stoichiometry is 1:1. So the complex dissociates as:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-

And the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on pH. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal, which I think implies that the majority of EDTA is in the correct deprotonated form (Y^4-) needed to form the complex. So I can probably assume that [EDTA^4-] is the same as the total free EDTA concentration, but wait no—maybe I should consider that the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex and any free EDTA. Hmm, but the problem might be simplifying things.

Wait, if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that's the concentration of the complex. Let me denote the complex as [CaY²-] = 0.02 M.

The formation constant Kf is 5e10. So the reaction is:

Ca²+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY²- ; Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

We're supposed to find [Ca²+].

Assuming that the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. But wait, since the pH is ideal, any free EDTA in solution is in the Y^4- form. So perhaps the assumption is that [Y^4-] is much higher than any other species, but in this case, maybe the [Y^4-] comes from the complex.

Wait, another approach: The complex is in solution, and it can dissociate into Ca²+ and Y^4-. The total concentration of Y^4- is the sum of the free Y^4- and that bound in the complex. But wait, the complex is 0.02 M, so if [CaY²-] is 0.02 M, then [Ca²+] and [Y] would be related through Kf.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be [Ca²+]. Then, [Y^4-] would be (total EDTA) minus [CaY²-]. Wait, no, the total EDTA in solution is the sum of the free EDTA (Y^4-) and the EDTA bound in the complex (CaY²-). But wait, the initial solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, so the EDTA comes only from that complex. Because the problem only mentions that the solution contains 0.02 M of the complex, so I think no other EDTA is present initially. Hmm, but wait, when the complex dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and Y^4-. So the total EDTA in solution is [Y^4-] + [CaY²-] = 0.02 M?

Wait, that's assuming that all the EDTA comes from the complex. So, if the initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex, then the total EDTA (both free and in complex) is 0.02 M. So [Y^4-] + [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. But since [CaY²-] is 0.02 M, then [Y^4-] would be (0.02 - [CaY²-]). Wait, no, because [CaY²-] is 0.02 M, which is the initial concentration. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the formation constant equation and the assumption that [CaY²-] is 0.02 M.

Let me think: Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for [Ca²+].

[Ca²+] = [CaY²-] / (Kf * [Y^4-}).

But I don't know [Y^4-]. Hmm. So perhaps I can find [Y^4-] in terms of [Ca²+].

Wait, the total EDTA is [Y^4-] + [CaY²-} = 0.02 M.

Wait, no. The solution contains 0.02 M CaY²-, and any free EDTA (Y^4-) comes from the dissociation of CaY²-.

So, total EDTA (Y_total) is [Y^4-] + [CaY²-} = 0.02 M? Because the entire EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex. So Y_total = 0.02 M.

So [Y^4-] + [CaY²-} = 0.02 M. But [CaY²-} is given as 0.02 M, so that implies [Y^4-} = 0.02 M - 0.02 M = 0. So that can't be right, because that would imply [Y^4-} is zero, which can't be correct.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The initial solution is 0.02 M CaY²-. So the total EDTA is 0.02 M, all as CaY²- and any free Y^4- that comes from dissociation.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me assume that the dissociation is minimal because Kf is very large (5e10). So the amount of dissociation is small, meaning [Ca²+] is very small, and [Y^4-} is approximately equal to [CaY²-}.

Wait, no. Because Kf is so large, the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal. So most of the CaY²- remains as the complex, and a small amount dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-.

So, let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ produced from dissociation. Then, [Ca²+] = x.

The concentration of Y^4- would also be x, assuming that each dissociation gives one Y^4- and one Ca²+.

Wait, that's an assumption. So, each mole of CaY²- that dissociates produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of Y^4-.

So, [CaY²-} = 0.02 - x.

But wait, since x is very small compared to 0.02 (because Kf is large), 0.02 - x ≈0.02.

So, Kf = [CaY²-} / ([Ca²+][Y^4-}) ) = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 0.02 / x².

Set this equal to 5e10.

So,

0.02 / x² = 5e10 → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → x² = 4e-14 → x = sqrt(4e-14) → x = 2e-7 M.

Wait, that's 2e-7 M for [Ca²+]. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7. Hmm, not matching. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

Kf = (2e-2) / (x * x) ) = 5e10 → x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's do that correctly.

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2.

So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ?

Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * (1e-6.5) → 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Ah, so [Ca²+] is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking back at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the answer should be C.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when Kf is very large, the complex is almost completely intact, and the concentration of free Ca²+ is very low.

So the initial assumption that [CaY²-} is approximately 0.02 M is correct because x is much smaller than 0.02. So the calculation seems right.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex (CaY²⁻) with a formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we use the equilibrium equation for the dissociation of the complex:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

### Assumptions:
1. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is given as \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\).
2. The pH is ideal, meaning all EDTA is in the form of \(\text{Y}^{4-}\), and no additional EDTA is present initially.
3. The dissociation of the complex is minimal due to the very large \( K_f \), so \([ \text{CaY}^{2-} ] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\).

### Variables:
- Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \([ \text{Ca}^{2+} ]\).
- Since the dissociation is minimal, \([ \text{Y}^{4-} ] = x\) (as each dissociation produces one \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) and one \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\)).

### Equation Setup:
Substitute into the equilibrium equation:
\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]} \implies 5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

### Solve for \( x \):
Rearranging:
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Conclusion:
The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
