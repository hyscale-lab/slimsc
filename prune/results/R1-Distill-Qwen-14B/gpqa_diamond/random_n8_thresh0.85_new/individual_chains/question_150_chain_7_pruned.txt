Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can do.

The question involves a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. There are some NMR data, and then a series of reactions. The goal is to figure out the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures.

First, I need to analyze the NMR data to determine the structure of the starting compound. Let's look at the NMR.

The 1H-NMR data provided is:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. The integration is 1H for the peak at 9.72. That's a triplet, which suggests it's a proton adjacent to two other protons. A triplet often comes from a CH2 group next to something else. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the triplet might be because it's next to a CH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's a proton adjacent to another group.

Wait, but in aromatic regions, a triplet could be part of a conjugated system. Oh wait, 9.72 is a high chemical shift, which is likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or sometimes a triplet if there's coupling. But wait, why a triplet? Oh, maybe it's an alpha proton next to an aldehyde. Wait, no. Wait, an aldehyde proton is typically a singlet because there's no adjacent protons on the same carbon. Oh, but if the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, maybe it's a triplet? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, aldehydes are usually deshielded, so that makes sense. But wait, the integration is 1H. So maybe it's an aldehyde proton. But why a triplet? Maybe the proton is coupled with two equivalent protons elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like an enol tautomer or something else.

Wait, what other protons could be around 9-10 ppm? Maybe an aromatic proton in a strongly deshielded environment, but that's less common. Alternatively, an enol proton? Or maybe a formyl group adjacent to something else.

Wait, let me think about the rest of the peaks. The 6.98 ppm doublet (2H) and 6.51 ppm doublet (2H) suggest two sets of two protons each. That could be a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two protons each as a pair, so maybe a di-substituted benzene ring where each substituent is in para positions, but that would usually give a singlet for each. Wait, unless it's a di-substituted ring with ortho coupling.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a pair of protons in a di-substituted benzene. For example, in para positions, each proton would be a doublet due to coupling with the other. Because if they are adjacent (ortho), the coupling would be larger, but para coupling is smaller. Alternatively, perhaps they're part of a conjugated system with another substituent. Wait, perhaps the structure has two benzene rings attached, each with substituents.

Wait, looking at the integration, 2H each for the aromatic regions. So maybe two benzene rings each with two protons in a doublet. Or maybe one benzene ring with four protons in total, split into two doublets. Hmm.

Wait, the downfield shift at 6.98 ppm (d) and 6.51 ppm (d) suggests a di-substituted benzene with electron-withdrawing groups. Like para-nitrophenol or something similar? But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So the formula includes one N and one O. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation: could be a ring and some double bonds. For example, benzene rings (each contributes 3) would account for 6, but we have 5, so perhaps one benzene and one double bond elsewhere.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, benzene is C6H6. So if there's a benzene ring, then the remaining is C2H3NO. Hmm, that might form a structure like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

But perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let's think about the NMR.

The peak at 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) suggests a CH2 group. A doublet, so adjacent to another CH2 or a CH group. Wait, maybe it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. Or perhaps it's a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom.

Wait, if the compound has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm peak), and perhaps a benzaldehyde with substituents.

Another approach is to think about the reagents provided. The reaction sequence is:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

NaNO2 and HCl are usually used for diazotization. So the first step likely converts an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt. But wait, the starting compound has an N, but it's part of the molecular formula C8H9NO. So the N is present as something else.

Wait, wait. The formula has one N, one O. So what could have an N in it? Maybe an amine, but in the molecular formula, it's C8H9NO. So if it's an amine, perhaps a primary aromatic amine. Because after diazotization, the diazonium salt can undergo various reactions.

Alternatively, maybe the N is in a ring, like a pyrrole or similar, but that might complicate things.

Wait, but let's think about the reagents. Step 1 is NaNO2 and HCl. This is under cold conditions, typically for diazotization, which is done with primary aromatic amines at low temps (like 0-5Â°C). Then, step 2 is H2O, which might be hydrolysis. Step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat, which suggests a possible elimination reaction, like a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement, or maybe a hydrolysis under basic conditions.

Wait, but another possibility is that the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis to form phenols if the conditions are aqueous and possibly acidic or basic.

Wait, but let me think again about the starting compound. The NMR has a triplet at 9.72 ppm. Maybe that's the aldehyde proton, but why a triplet? Aldehydes are usually singlets. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acidic proton elsewhere, like a phenolic OH proton. But phenolic OH protons are usually broad singlets, not triplets. Unless it's exchanging and not showing up. Wait, but the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That could be an aromatic ring with two protons, perhaps in a meta or para arrangement with substituents, or maybe a di-substituted ring.

Alternatively, the 6.27 could be an enol proton, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with substituents and some sort of side chain. Let me try to draw it out in my mind.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cinnamaldehyde derivative, but let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: if the compound is an aromatic aldehyde with substituents. For example,
