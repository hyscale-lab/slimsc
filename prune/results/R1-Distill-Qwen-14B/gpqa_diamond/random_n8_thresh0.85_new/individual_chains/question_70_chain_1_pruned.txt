Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

The question starts with a series of reactions. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Then, gas D reacts with gas B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

The question is about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to figure out what these compounds are. Let's start with the reactions.

First reaction: A + 8B → C (bright red). I remember that bright red products in reactions could be things like sulfur or maybe something else... Wait, wait. If A is a solid reacting with gas B in a 8:1 ratio to form a red product, what comes to mind is perhaps a metal reacting with a halogen. But wait, another possibility is something like the reaction between sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl2) to form NaCl. But wait, Na is a solid, Cl2 is a gas, but the product would be NaCl, a white solid. Hmm, not red.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's the reaction between magnesium and bromine? Wait, let me think. Magnesium is a solid, bromine is a dark red liquid or gas? Wait, bromine is a diatomic gas at room temperature, dark red. So if A is Mg and B is Br2, then Mg + Br2 → MgBr2. But would that be bright red? MgBr2 is a white solid, I think. So that's not matching.

Wait another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving iodine? Because I2 is a solid at room temp, but when it's in solution, it's dark purple. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a compound with a red color. Another possibility is SO3 reacting with something, but I don't think that's it.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction: C reacts with D in a 2:1 ratio to form E, which is dangerous. Also, C reacts with water to form A and two acids F and G, where F is strong and G is weak.

If C reacts with water to form A and two acids, perhaps C is a salt that is hydrolyzed in water to produce a metal hydroxide (forming A) and two acids. Wait, but then C would be a sulfide maybe? Or maybe a nitride.

Wait, another angle: if F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 (sulfurous acid, which is weak). Or, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HClO (weak). Wait, but the reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G.

Wait, for example, if C is a sulfite salt. Let me think: suppose C is Na2SO3. When it reacts with water, maybe it's just dissolving? No, because it's a solid reacting with water to form A, which is the original solid, and two acids. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, perhaps C is something like a metal sulfide. For example, PbS is a dark substance, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Maybe C is a trioxide, like SO3. Because when SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4. Wait, but that's only one acid, not two. Hmm. Alternatively, if C is a nitrate? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of D with B to form H, which is a solvent. D and B in a 1:1 ratio. Suppose B is Cl2 and D is NH3. Because Cl2 and NH3 react in a 1:1 ratio to form NH2Cl, but wait, that's not a solvent. Or maybe D is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2, and D is H2. Then, O2 and H2 react to form H2O, which is a solvent. But H2O is a liquid, but it's a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier, in the first reaction, A is a solid reacting with B gas. If B is O2, and A is a metal like sodium, then Na + O2 → NaO2? No, NaO2 is sodium peroxide, but sodium is a solid, O2 is a gas. The reaction is 2 Na + O2 → Na2O2. But that's a 2:1 ratio. Wait, the first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B. So perhaps the stoichiometry is different.

Wait, 8 equivalents of B. So if B is O2, then the reaction would be A + 4 O2 → product. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, then 8 moles of Cl2 would require a solid that reacts in an 8:1 ratio. Hmm.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's think about product E. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Maybe sarin gas, or something like phosgene, or perhaps something like hydrogen cyanide. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine, but that's not extremely hazardous beyond that.

Wait, another possibility: E could be a nerve agent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like ozone, but ozone is a gas. Alternatively, perhaps E is a cyanide compound, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is about the formation of a metal chloride. Let's think: if A is Na, B is Cl2, then 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 8:1, so that doesn't fit. So maybe the ratio is 8 equivalents of B per mole of A. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is aluminum (Al), and B is Cl2. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. That's a 3:2 ratio. But the problem says 8 equivalents, so perhaps the ratio is 8:1. So maybe the formula is A + 8 B → product. So if A is a metal with a valency that requires 8 equivalents of B, perhaps it's a +1 metal reacting with a diatomic B. Let me think: if A is Na (valency +1), and B is Cl2 (each molecule has 2 atoms), then the reaction would be 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. But that's a 1:2 ratio of Na to Cl2, not 8:1.

Wait, perhaps A is something else. Maybe A is a metal that forms a +3 ion, and B is a diatomic gas. Let's see: for example, Al reacting with Cl2. The reaction is 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So moles of B (Cl2) per mole of A (Al) is 3/2. So 8 equivalents would imply a much higher ratio. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps B isn't a diatomic gas but something else. Wait, maybe B is O2. So 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of A. Then, if A is Fe, the reaction would be something like 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3. That's a 3:4 ratio, not 8:1.

Alternatively, maybe B is F2, which is a gas. The reaction between metals and F2 can be very vigorous. For example, Mg + F2 → MgF2. The stoichiometry here is 1:1 per atom. So Mg (1 mole) reacts with 1 mole F2 to form MgF2. But the problem states 8 equivalents of B, so 8 F2 per mole of A. Hmm, that would require a formula like A + 8 F2 → product. So for example, maybe A is Ca, which has a +2 charge. So 2 Ca + 8 F2 → 2 CaF2 + something? Wait, no, because 2 Ca would need 4 F2 for 2 CaF2.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal. Maybe something like Ti reacting with F2. Ti is a solid, F2 is a gas. The reaction is Ti + F2 → TiF4. So 1 Ti : 2 F2. So 8 equivalents would require 4 F2 per Ti. Hmm, not matching.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about product C. When C reacts with D (gas) in a 2:1 ratio to produce E, which is extremely dangerous.

Wait, perhaps C is SO3. Then, when it reacts with something, maybe D is something like NH3. SO3 + NH3 → (NH4)2SO4? Or wait, maybe it's a reaction that forms something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS, but when it reacts with water, it forms Fe(OH)2 and H2S. But then F would be H2S (a weak acid) and G would be another acid, perhaps H2O? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacting with water to form Mg(OH)2 and NH3 (which is a weak acid? Wait, NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbide, like CaC2. When it reacts with water, it forms Ca(OH)2 and C2H2 (acetylene). But I'm not sure about the acids here.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction: C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio. Let's say C is a metal oxide. Suppose C is Na2O. Then, D could
