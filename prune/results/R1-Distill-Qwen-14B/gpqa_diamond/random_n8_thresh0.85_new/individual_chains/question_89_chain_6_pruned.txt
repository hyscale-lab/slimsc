Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so it's about organic chemistry reactions and NMR spectroscopy. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a very rigid molecule. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

First reaction: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but with KOH, if it's a dihalide, elimination would form an alkene. But wait, in the case of adjacent bromines, like 1,2-dibromo, elimination would form a double bond. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are not adjacent. So would elimination still happen? Maybe it's a di-elimination? Or perhaps it's a single elimination, but with adjacent positions?

Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others. So 1,3 positions would be across the structure. So I'm thinking that the reaction might produce an alkene. Wait, when two molecules undergo elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. But if the two bromines are on non-adjacent carbons, how would elimination work? Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination, but if the dihalide is not vicinal, maybe it's a different mechanism.

Wait, KOH in such conditions might cause a double elimination. So two E2 eliminations, each removing a Br and a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. So the product would be an adamantane with a double bond.

Wait, but let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane: each Br is on a different carbon, but not adjacent. So when KOH is added, maybe each Br is removed via elimination to form a double bond between the 1 and 3 positions? Wait, but in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 are opposite each other. So perhaps the product is not an alkene but something else.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide? No, because KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent for epoxide formation. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, I don't think so. Wait, let me think about the product's NMR.

The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 must have a ketone group. So the reaction is probably a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but wait—how does that happen? Because elimination reactions typically form alkenes, but if you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, perhaps it's a case of forming a ketone via a double elimination.

Wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann-type elimination? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination leads to a conjugated diene. But wait, the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone. So perhaps the product is a diketone? Or maybe it's a single ketone.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: when heated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would form a diol. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So maybe it's not substitution but elimination. Wait, another possibility: elimination of HBr twice, leading to a conjugated diene. But IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and upon heating with KOH, each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would form a diol. But why is the IR showing a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a double elimination, each Br leaving as Br- and the adjacent H being abstracted, leading to a double bond. But then why the carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of a reaction where two bromides are eliminated to form a carbonyl group. Oh wait, perhaps it's a case of forming an epoxide, but no, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of formation of a ketone via elimination of HBr twice, but how.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a CH2 group. So for each Br, elimination of HBr would form a double bond. But wait, in an adamantane structure, if each Br is on a different bridgehead, eliminating two HBr would form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's rule. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a carbonyl group via some mechanism. Oh! Wait, perhaps the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a bridge structure, so elimination of two HBr molecules would form a ketone. Let me think: if two adjacent bromides are on a bridge, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, in 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, elimination would form cyclohexene. But in adamantane, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridge with a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's more like the formation of a ketone via oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the Hofmann elimination, but that typically involves amines. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a ketone formed via the loss of HBr from each of the two brominated carbons. So each Br is on a CH2 group, so elimination would form a carbonyl. Let me imagine:

If each Br is on a CH2Br group, perhaps the two adjacent CH2Br groups lose HBr each, forming a double bond. Wait, but that would form a double bond, not a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe each CH2Br group loses HBr, but what's left would be two CH2 groups which then form a carbonyl. Hmm, not making much sense.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of forming a conjugated diene, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So the integration is 2 + 10 + 2 = 14H. Adamantane has 12 carbons, but perhaps the product has a different structure. Wait, product 1 is a light yellow solid, which might be a ketone.

Wait, 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H. That could be an -OCH2O- group, but that's an ether. But then, the IR shows a carbonyl. Alternatively, that could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the product is an epoxide, but that would have a different IR peak, perhaps around 1200-1300 cm-1 for the epoxide O. Alternatively, the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong indicator of a ketone.

So perhaps the product is a diketone. But let me think about the structure. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, would form an adamantane with two ketone groups. But that seems more complex.

Alternatively, maybe each Br is on a CH2 group, and elimination of two HBr leads to a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the IR peak. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but nucleophilic substitution. But the IR suggests a carbonyl, so substitution doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe elimination produces a ketone via some conjugate mechanism.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the next step and see if that helps.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it's a cyclization or some kind of acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, but the IR shows a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, let's think again. Maybe product 1 is a diketone, like 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of aldol condensation, forming a ring or a new structure. Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation if there's an aromatic ring, but adamantane
