Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's see. The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the standard deviation of an observable to another, but maybe I need to compute the expectation values and then find the uncertainty from there.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Oh right, the state vector is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So I think that means the state is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That might make things easier because calculating expectation values and uncertainties in the same basis is straightforward.

So, the uncertainty in P_z, ΔP_z, is the square root of the variance, which is <P_z²> - <P_z>². Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but P_z is another operator, I need to calculate these expectation values.

Wait, but since the state is expressed in the P_z basis, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. Let me look at the matrix for P_z. Oh, right, P_z is diagonal in this basis. So the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. The matrix is:

[ℏ , 0, 0;
0, 0, 0;
0, 0, -ℏ]

So the eigenvalues are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So the state vector components are the amplitudes for each eigenstate.

So the state is a combination of the eigenstates |+z>, |0z>, and |-z> with coefficients -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), and -1/2 respectively.

Wait, let me note the state vector. The components are:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

So the first component is for P_z eigenvalue ℏ, the second for 0, and third for -ℏ.

To find <P_z>, I can calculate the expectation value. Since the state is already in the P_z basis, the expectation value is the sum of |c_i|^2 * λ_i, where c_i are the coefficients and λ_i the eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think. The expectation value <P_z> is given by the sum over i
