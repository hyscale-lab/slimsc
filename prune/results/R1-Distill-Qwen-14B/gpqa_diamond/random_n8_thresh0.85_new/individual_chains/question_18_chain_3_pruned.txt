Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here since the question is about elemental abundances. Maybe they're just extra info, but perhaps they come into play somehow with the life cycle of the stars? Hmm, I'll keep that in mind but focus on the composition part.

The problem says that using LTE and the EW method, the elemental abundances are determined. The given values are:

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, so Star_1 has [Si/Fe] of +0.3, meaning more silicon relative to iron. And [Fe/H] is 0, meaning the iron abundance is the same as the Sun. For Star_2, [Mg/Si] is +0.3, so more magnesium relative to silicon, and [Mg/H] is 0, so magnesium is same as the Sun.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So the ratio n_Si1 / n_Si2, right? Or wait, maybe n_Si2 / n_Si1? No, the question says ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2, so I think it's (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

But to find that, I probably need to find n_Si in each star relative to hydrogen, then compute the ratio.

Wait, let's think about it. The [X/Y] notation is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, so [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Alternatively, some sources define it as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun, which is the same as log([nX/nY]_star / [nX/nY]_sun) )

So for [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, that means log(n_Si/n_Fe, star1) - log(n_Si/n_Fe, sun) = 0.3. So log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = log(n_Si_sun / n_F
