Okay, so I've got this question here about a ligand-receptor pair in some mouse models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think through it.

So the setup is that there's a new ligand-receptor pair found in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and some beta sheets. The ligand is a coiled-coil made of two alpha helices. 

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, but the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. Oh, I remember that IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive the expression of the downstream gene without the need for a separate promoter. So the CBA promoter would drive the ligand, and the IRES would drive the receptor.

There's a stop cassette between the ligand and mCherry, with loxP. And another stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP with lox2272. Oh, right, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites, so the Cre would only recombine one of them. So when Cre is expressed, it will remove the stop cassette that's flanked by the appropriate lox sites.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the Western blot. The total proteins were proportional to actin loading, so that's working. But then they bred mice homozygous for the construct on a wild-type background. Then crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. After the offspring are born, they look under the confocal. They don't see green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Wait, the construct is in the mouse. The vector is a bicistronic vector, so both ligand and receptor are expressed. But when Cre is present, the stops are removed. SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development, I think. SOX10-Cre would probably drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, which are the origin of the ligand and receptor expression.

So when they cross the homozygous mice to SOX10-Cre, the Cre should activate the construct. But the eGFP isn't showing up. What's wrong?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell, I think. Because the vector is a bicistronic construct, ligand and receptor would be in the same cell, but if paracrine, maybe they're secreted and act on other cells. But why would that prevent GFP expression? I'm not sure.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. So no surface expression. But why would the GFP not be expressed? The vector should have the receptor with eGFP at the C-terminus. If the receptor is properly processed, GFP should be expressed. If stuck in Golgi, maybe not on the surface, but should still be present in the cell, so detected by Western? But the question says the Western was done on transfected primary astrocytes. Maybe in the mice, the expression is in a different cell type.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The ligand is under CBA promoter and receptor under IRES. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so maybe it doesn't need enhancers. But wait, the construct was transfected into primary astrocytes and the Western blot worked, so the expression was happening in vitro. So maybe the issue isn't the promoter in the mice. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working. But IRES elements are usually efficient in certain cell types.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would cause a problem in expression. Wait, the construct is receptor ORF at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Oh wait, maybe the stop cassettes have different lox sites. The ligand has loxP, the receptor has lox2272. So when Cre is present, which lox site does it act on?

Wait, the vector is set up so that the ligand is first, then a stop cassette with loxP, then the receptor with IRES, and then the receptor is followed by another stop cassette with lox2272 and then eGFP. Hmm, wait, no: the ligand is 5', fused to mCherry with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette in between. So the ligand is expressed only if the loxP sites are recombined. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a lox2272 stop cassette. So the ligand and mCherry would only be expressed if the loxP is cut, and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed if lox2272 is cut.

Wait, but in a bicistronic vector, how does this work? Let me visualize the construct:

Ligand ORF (under CBA promoter) --> loxP-stop-loxP --> mCherry

Then, after the IRES, the Receptor ORF --> lox2272-stop-lox2272 --> eGFP.

Wait, no, I think the actual structure is:

The vector is designed such that the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). Then, after the stop, comes the IRES which drives the expression of the receptor. The receptor is followed by a stop cassette (lox2272) and then eGFP.

So when Cre is present, the loxP and lox2272 sites can be recombined. Since Cre recognizes loxP sites, it will delete the loxP-stop-loxP cassette, allowing the mCherry to be expressed along with the ligand. Similarly, the lox2272 is a different site, so a Cre variant or a different recombinase is needed. Wait, but the question says the stop cassette between the ligand and mCherry is loxP, and between the receptor and eGFP is lox2272. So the Cre used should have specificity for loxP. So when Cre is expressed, it will only recombine the loxP sites, right?

Wait, but in the setup, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So the ligand and receptor are co-expressed, but they're each under separate regulatory elements. So the ligand is under CBA, the receptor under IRES.

Wait, but the stop cassettes are in between the ORFs and the fluorescent proteins. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is behind a stop cassette. So the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. The receptor is expressed via the IRES, but the eGFP is behind a lox2272 stop cassette. So without Cre, you get ligand and receptor expression, but mCherry and eGFP are not expressed.

When Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, so the stop cassette is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 stop cassette would require a different Cre (or a different recombinase like Dre?), but in this case, they're using Cre. Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant of loxP. Oh, but lox2272 is a lox site that requires Cre to recombine, but perhaps it's a different arrangement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the loxP and lox2272 are both Cre recognition sites. Oh, but lox2272 is a mutated version of loxP that's used for reversing the site or something. So when Cre is used, it can mediate recombination between loxP and lox2272? Or not.

Wait, loxP is 34 bp with 13 bp arms. Lox2272 is a variant with a different arrangement, making it possible for Cre to mediate recombination between loxP and lox2272. So in this construct, the first stop cassette is loxP, and the second is lox2272. So when Cre is expressed, it would delete both stop cassettes, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the question, they used SOX10-Cre mice. So in the offspring, which would have the Cre expression under SOX10 promoter (neural crest cells and perhaps other cells).

So in the mice, the construct is in a loxP and lox2272 configuration. The Cre would recombine both lox sites, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed when Cre is active.

But the problem is that in the confocal, they don't see green. So the eGFP isn't being expressed.

Let me consider the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, how's the construct built? The receptor's ORF is fused to eGFP. If the stop cassette isn't properly removed, then the eGFP might not be expressed. Or if the frame is wrong. Or perhaps when the stop is removed, the eGFP is added in frame.

Wait, the vector is ligand ORF (under CBA) followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. Then, the receptor is after IRES, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272), then eGFP. So the eGFP is in a separate cassette.

Wait, but the construct is arranged as:

Ligand (CBA) --> stop (loxP) --> mCherry
|
IRES
|
Receptor --> stop (lox2272) --> eGFP

So when Cre recombines the loxP sites, the stop is removed between ligand and mCherry, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, Cre would also recombine the lox2272 sites, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

But in the question, when the mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest-derived cells. So the construct should excise both stop cassettes, leading to expression of both mCherry and eGFP.

But in the confocal, only green is looked for? Or both? They don't see green, which is eGFP.

Wait, why wouldn't eGFP be expressed? Let's think about the vector. The eGFP is after the receptor, and the stop is lox2272. If the Cre is active, it should remove that stop, allowing the receptor to be expressed along with eGFP.

But perhaps the issue is that the stop cassette isn't being removed correctly. Or perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because it's not in frame.

Wait, if the lox2272 stop cassette is not correctly flanking the eGFP, then the eGFP might not be expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP isn't in the same reading frame as the receptor.

Wait, the construct is receptor ORF followed by a stop cassette, then eGFP. So the eGFP is in a separate ORF. So when the stop is removed, it's just the eGFP that's expressed as a separate protein, right?

So the eGFP should be expressed as a separate protein if the stop is removed.

Wait, another possibility: the stop cassette is in the wrong place. If the stop is after the receptor, but the eGFP is in a different frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP would be part of a longer ORF? Or perhaps the eGFP is added in frame. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the lox2272 sites are not present, the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed. But in the setup, it's supposed to be present.

Wait, but in the initial setup, after transfection into astrocytes, the Western blot works. That suggests that the construct is expressed. So perhaps in vitro, the stop cassettes are properly removed, allowing both fluorescent proteins to be expressed. But in the mice, maybe something is wrong.

Another angle: the SOX10-Cre is only active in certain cells. So perhaps in the mice, Cre isn't being expressed properly, so the stop cassettes are not removed. Therefore, the eGFP remains under the stop cassette, so it's not expressed.

But the mice are homozygous for the construct, and are crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous. So the offspring would be heterozygous for the construct and hemizygous for SOX10-Cre. That should mean Cre is active in the neural crest and possibly other cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being correctly expressed because the frame is wrong. Wait, how's the eGFP added? If the stop cassette is in between the receptor and eGFP, and when the stop is removed, the eGFP is added in frame, then the receptor-eGFP would be a fusion protein. Wait, no, because the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP. So the eGFP is in the same ORF as the receptor? Or is it a separate ORF?

Wait, the way it's written, the receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP. So the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, and eGFP is a separate ORF, but in the same vector.

Wait, no. Let me think about the vector design. The vector is bicistronic, so two separate ORFs. The first is ligand under CBA, then a stop, then mCherry. The second is the receptor under IRES, followed by a stop, then eGFP.

Wait, no, the vector is:

5' LoxP Stop LoxP mCherry

IRES

Receptor Lox2272 Stop Lox2272 eGFP 3'

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the vector as:

Ligand (CBA promoter) --> stop cassette (loxP) --> mCherry

Then, the IRES drives the expression of the receptor, which has its own ORF, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272) --> eGFP.

So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry is not because of the stop. The receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not.

When Cre is present, it will recombine the loxP sites, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But to recombine the lox2272 sites, you need a different recombinase, perhaps? Or does Cre also handle lox2272?

Wait, no, lox2272 is a variant of loxP that requires Cre. So the same Cre can recombine both loxP and lox2272 sites.

So in the mice, the Cre from SOX10-Cre should recombine both loxP and lox2272, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the confocal, they don't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So if the stop cassette is recombined, the eGFP would be expressed as a separate protein, but if it's not in frame, perhaps the eGFP isn't made. But wait, the eGFP is a separate ORF. No, in the construct, the eGFP is downstream of the receptor, but in a separate ORF. So after the stop is removed (lox2272), the eGFP should be expressed as a separate protein. So the frame doesn't matter because it's a separate ORF.

Wait, unless the lox2272 cassette is in the middle of the receptor, but I don't think so. The stop is after the receptor.

Hmm.

Option C: enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. The construct uses the CBA promoter
