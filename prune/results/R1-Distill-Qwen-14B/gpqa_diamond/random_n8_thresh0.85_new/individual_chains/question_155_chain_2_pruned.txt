Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, denoted as ΔP_z. I remember that uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator in question. So, in this case, A is P_z.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which suggests that the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z.

Wait, but if the state is already in the P_z basis, that might make things easier because the expectation values might be simpler to compute. Let me think.

First, let's write down the state vector. It's a column vector:
ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of ψ corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. P_z's matrix is given as:
P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ). So its eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ. The components of ψ correspond to these eigenvalues.

So, ψ is a superposition of the eigenstates of P_z. The first component (index 1) is an eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ, the second is 0, and the third is -ħ.

The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is calculated as ψ† P_z ψ. Let me compute that.

Wait, but since ψ is in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component squared gives the probability of being in that eigenstate. So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of (probability of each state multiplied by their eigenvalues).

So, let's compute the probabilities first.

The first component is (-1/2), so the probability is ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4.
The second component is 1/sqrt(2), so probability is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.
The third component is (-1/2), probability 1/4.

Now, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is:
(1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the first term in the uncertainty formula is zero. Then, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of (P_z squared) minus (⟨P_z⟩)^2. But ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so it's just sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩).

Wait, but what's P_z squared? Since P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So P_z squared would be diag(ħ², 0, ħ²). So when we calculate ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the
