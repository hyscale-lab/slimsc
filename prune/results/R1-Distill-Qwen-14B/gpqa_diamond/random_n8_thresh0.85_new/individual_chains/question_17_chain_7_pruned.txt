Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on EDTA complexes, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A larger K means the complex is more stable.

So, the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 0.02 M. I think that's the concentration of the complex formed. The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, in such complexes, the metal ion (Ca²+) and EDTA form a complex. The reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or something similar), right? The formation constant K would be for the formation of the complex from the ions.

So the formation equation would be: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K for this reaction would be [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5x10^10.

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That means, under ideal conditions (pH is ideal), the complex doesn't dissociate much. But wait, the formation constant is large, so the complex is stable, meaning [Ca²+] should be very low, right?

Wait, but what's the total concentration here? The total concentration of calcium would be the sum of the free Ca²+ and the Ca bound in the complex. But if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, then that's the concentration of the complex, assuming all the Ca is in the complex. Or is that the total concentration?

Wait, no. Let me think. When you have a solution of a metal-EDTA complex, the total concentration is the sum of the free metal ions and the complex. But if
