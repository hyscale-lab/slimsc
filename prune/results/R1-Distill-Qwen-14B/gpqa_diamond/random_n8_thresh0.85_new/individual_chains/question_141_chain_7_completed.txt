Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Oh, probably it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because 1-bromo-2-d doesn't make much sense. So the structure would have a bromine on the benzene ring at position 1, and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Or wait, maybe I should think of it as 1-bromo-2,6-dimethylbenzene? Because numbering in benzene derivatives can be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? No, the question says 2-d, which I think is a typo, maybe 2-methyl or 2-something. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromobenzene with two substituents, like two methyl groups. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Let's assume that for now; the exact substituents might not matter as much as the reaction mechanism.

So the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In aromatic substitution, NaNH2 is used for dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond (like in the formation of a benzene ring from a toluene derivative, but I'm not sure). Alternatively, NaNH2 is used in the Birch reduction, but wait, that's with NH3 and a metal, maybe in a different solvent. Alternatively, I recall that when you have an aryl halide, like bromobenzene, and treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination if possible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but benzene is generally not very reactive towards elimination because it's already an aromatic ring. But wait, perhaps in this case, if the starting material is a bromide attached to the ring, maybe it's a benzylic bromide? No, wait, benzyl bromide is CH2Br attached to benzene. But in the case of 1-bromobenzene-2-d, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a Br and some other substituents which could lead to elimination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction where the Br is removed, and a double bond forms. But benzene is already a ring of conjugated double bonds, so perhaps the reaction isn't elimination in that sense. Alternatively, is this a case of forming a benzyn intermediate? Because if you have a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dibromobenzene, treating with a strong base like NaNH2 can lead to elimination of HBr from adjacent positions, forming a triple bond (aryne). But wait, our starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So in that case, the Br is at position 1, and there are methyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Wait, but if there's only one Br, then elimination would require another halogen adjacent to it. So maybe that's not the case here. Hmm... Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, and I'm not sure if nucleophilic aromatic substitution would occur here, as that typically requires activating groups to make the ring susceptible to attack by a nucleophile. But in this case, the substituents are methyl groups, which are activating, but the position matters.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be the formation of a benzene ring with a new substituent. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the structure is: benzene ring with Br at position 1, methyl at 2 and 4. So positions 2 and 4 are occupied by CH3 groups. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, what happens?

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and in ammonia solvent, maybe it abstracts a proton. But where? Because NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it deprotonates something. But the ring is deactivated by Br, but the methyl groups are activating.

Wait, perhaps the Br is in a position where it can undergo elimination. But I'm not seeing adjacent Br. Alternatively, maybe the Br is on a position that allows for a ring expansion or contraction? I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is causing a dehydrohalogenation, but that's more common in aliphatic compounds. For example, in toluene derivatives, like benzyl bromide, where H and Br are adjacent, elimination can occur to form a double bond. Wait, but benzyl bromide is CH2Br attached to benzene. So, if the bromide is attached to the benzene ring through a CH2 group, then elimination could form a double bond (like styrene).

But in the given problem, the bromine is directly attached to the benzene ring. So, it's a bromobenzene derivative. So the structure is C6H5Br. But wait, in our case, it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is o-dimethyl bromobenzene.

So, in such a case, treating with NaNH2 might not lead to elimination because there's no hydrogen adjacent to the Br on the ring. Because the ring is directly attached. So perhaps elimination isn't possible, and another reaction occurs.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the reaction is a substitution. NaNH2 could act as a base, abstracting a proton to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then attack the bromide. But that seems unlikely. Or maybe it's a single electron transfer, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts type, but NaNH2 is a base, not an acid catalyst, so Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the dehydrohalogenation forming a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere. But again, without a benzylic position, I'm not seeing where the H and Br would be removed from.

Wait, let's think about the structure. 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So positions 1, 2, and 4 have substituents. So the ring looks like this:

Positions:
1: Br
2: CH3
4: CH3

So does this arrangement allow for any possible elimination? Because if the Br is at position 1, and there's a methyl at 2 and 4, perhaps there's a possibility of forming a double bond between positions 1 and 2, but that would require H at position 1 adjacent to Br, which I don't think is the case because the Br is directly attached to the ring carbon. So in benzene, each carbon is bonded to the next via a double bond or a single bond, but all are part of the aromatic ring.

Wait, but benzene doesn't have H's directly attached to the ring in the same way as alkanes. Each carbon in benzene has one H except when there are substituents.

Wait, but in this case, the ring would have Br at C1, and CH3 at C2 and C4. So perhaps there's a possibility of forming a diradical or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, I'm confusing this with the formation of an aryne. To form an aryne, you need a dihalobenzene, where adjacent carbons have halogens. Then, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 would eliminate two equivalents of HX (like HBr) to form a triple bond (aryne). But in our case, the starting material has only one Br. So that's not possible. Unless, wait, maybe the other substituent is another Br, which I don't think is the case here.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dibromobenzene. But the question says it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 2-bromo toluene, but that would be a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the reaction again. NaNH2 is a strong base, and when used in ammonia, it can deprotonate things. So maybe in this case, the reaction is nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires that the leaving group is activated, meaning that the ring has electron-withdrawing groups which make the leaving group a better leaving group. But in our case, the substituents are methyl groups, which are electron-donating, which would make the ring more activated towards electrophilic substitution, not nucleophilic.

Wait, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it abstracts a proton from the ring. Wait, but benzene rings with substituents can have acidic protons. For example, in nitrobenzene, the ring protons are more acidic. But in toluene, the ring protons are a bit more acidic than benzene because of the methyl group, but not extremely.

So if the ring has methyl groups, maybe the protons adjacent to them could be abstractable by NaNH2. Let's imagine that.

So in 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the ring positions are:

Positions 1: Br
Position 2: CH3
Position 4: CH3

So the possible positions for deprotonation would be at positions 3, 5, and 6, perhaps. Because positions 2 and 4 are occupied by methyl groups, and position 1 has Br.

Wait, but the methyl groups are in positions 2 and 4, so the positions available for deprotonation would be 3, 5, and 6. Let me see: benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So 1 is Br, 2 is CH3, 4 is CH3. So the neighboring positions to Br would be 2 and 6. Position 2 has a CH3, so maybe the H's on position 6 could be abstracted. Alternatively, the rings have H's in positions 3, 5, and 6.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring adjacent to the Br. For example, position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. If that H is abstracted, would that leave a carbanion? But wait, benzene is aromatic, so removing a proton would make a carbanion which is deprotonated. But I'm not sure if that leads to any reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton near a methyl group, leading to some kind of rearrangement. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves as Br- and the ring becomes benzyne. But wait, that's only possible if two adjacent Br atoms are present, which they aren't in this case.

Wait, another angle: Could the reaction be a demethylation? Unlikely, because methyl groups are not easily removed under such conditions. Unless it's a nucleophilic substitution, but I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the problem is about elimination, but I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by something else. But the solvent is ammonia, so maybe the NH2- is acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, in that case, could the product be a substitution where Br is replaced by NH2? But NaNH2 is a strong base, and in aromatic substitution, such as nitration or other electrophilic substitutions, the ring must be activated towards electrophiles. But in this case, the substituents are methyl groups (activating, but meta directing), and the Br is a deactivating group (ortho/para directing). So if the ring becomes activated, perhaps the substitution occurs.

Wait, but in nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be strongly activated towards nucleophilic attack, which requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Without such groups, the substitution doesn't proceed. Our substituents are methyl (EDG), which deactivate the ring towards nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, making a benzene ring with a negative charge (a carbanion), which then could attack the Br. But I'm not sure about that mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the base induces some kind of elimination, but I don't see how with only one Br.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, forming a benzene ring with a double bond elsewhere. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of other reactions involving aryl halides and NaNH2. Oh wait! I think NaNH2 can deprotonate certain positions in the ring, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with an adjacent substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzene ring where the Br is replaced by a methyl group. But that would require some kind of substitution, and I'm not sure if that's feasible under these conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Birch reduction, where the benzene ring is hydrogenated. But Birch reduction uses metals like Na or Mg in ammonia, often with a catalyst, and it's usually under high pressure. I'm not sure if NaNH2 alone would cause that.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be a dehydrohalogenation, but in the case of aryl halides, that's less common than in aliphatic compounds. However, in some cases, like when the aryl halide is part of a larger structure, elimination can occur. For example, in diphenylacetylene, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the methyl groups play a role. Let's think about the structure again. 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. If the base abstracts a proton from position 3 (between the two methyl groups), could that lead to a shift or elimination?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. Then, maybe the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between positions 1 and 6. But I'm not sure if that's possible because benzene is already a conjugated ring.

Wait, but wait, if the Br leaves, that would create a carbocation, which on a benzene ring would be highly unstable. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a new substituent. But without a nucleophile attacking, I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the possible products. The question is, how many possible organic products are formed?

The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction leads to the elimination of HBr to form a triple bond (aryne), then two positions would be possible. But with only one Br, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, so there's only one product, which is the starting material. But that would mean option B)1. But that seems unlikely because the question is about a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms two products, so option C)2.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the Br undergoes substitution twice. Wait, but NaNH2 isn't a good nucleophile in this case. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton leading to isomerization.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is a demethylation, but I don't think NaNH2 would remove a methyl group easily. The methyl groups are attached to the ring, which is not easily deprotonated under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a new substituent. For example, if the Br is replaced by an amino group from NaNH2. But as I discussed earlier, nucleophilic aromatic substitution is unlikely here because the ring isn't activated towards nucleophilic attack. The methyl groups are EDG, which deactivate the ring towards nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton from the ring, making a carbanion, perhaps the Br could leave as Br- and the NH2- could attack, substituting the Br? But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isomerizes the substituents. Wait, but the substituents are already in specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehalogenation, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a benzidine rearrangement, but that requires specific structures which I don't think apply here.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of what the possible products could be.

If the reaction is elimination of HBr, but with only one Br, that's not possible. So that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the Br is replaced by NH2. That would be a substitution, leading to 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene. If that's the case, there's only one product, so option B)1.

But wait, is this substitution feasible? For substitution to occur, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Our ring has methyl groups which are activating but meta-directing. The Br is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating and ortho/para-directing. Hmm. The combination would make some positions more reactive. But would substitution occur under these conditions?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with two substituents. For example, if the Br is replaced by NH2, then the product would have NH2 at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. So that's one product.

Wait, but if the substitution occurs, perhaps the amino group could be at another position due to some mechanism. Or maybe the methyl groups shift positions, but that's unlikely.

So, if substitution occurs, only one product is formed. Hence, the number of possible products is 1, which is option B).

But wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a ring expansion. For example, if a methyl group is involved in some way. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form any products, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but as I thought earlier, without another adjacent Br, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe more than one substitution occurs. But with NaNH2, which is a strong base and a source of NH2-, perhaps multiple substitution reactions could occur. But I'm not seeing how.

Wait, another thought: The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. If NaNH2 abstracts a proton from position 3 (which is between the two methyl groups), perhaps the ring becomes deprotonated, leading to a carbanion. Then, the Br could leave, and the NH2- could attack. But that would require a double substitution, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves, and the ring forms a new substituent. But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination, leading to the formation of a benzene with a double bond, but I don't see how that would happen without adjacent X's.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible products based on the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in ammonia is often used for dehydrohalogenation of aliphatic compounds to form alkenes. But for aromatic compounds, perhaps the reaction isn't feasible, leading to no reaction. But that can't be, because the question suggests a reaction occurs.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that would require two adjacent leaving groups, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, where the NH2- replaces the Br. If that's the case, then the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is a single product. Hence, option B)1.

But wait, the reaction conditions: NaNH2 in ammonia. For nucleophilic substitution, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack. So, are the substituents activating enough?

The substituents are methyl groups (activating, EDG) at positions 2 and 4. The Br is deactivating (EWG). The overall effect on the ring's reactivity towards nucleophilic substitution would depend on the positions and the strength of the substituents. The methyl groups are in positions 2 and 4, which are ortho and para to the Br.

Wait, in para positions, the methyl groups would have a greater effect. So, perhaps the ring is activated enough to allow nucleophilic substitution.

So, if substitution occurs, the product would be 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is a single product.

Hence, the number of possible organic products is 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction conditions suggest the possibility of nucleophilic aromatic substitution (NAS). In nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the nucleophile (NH₂⁻) replaces the leaving group (Br⁻) on the aromatic ring. For NAS to occur, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, which typically requires electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) to make the ring electron-deficient.

In this case, the substituents on the benzene ring are methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, which are electron-donating groups (EDGs). These groups activate the ring towards electrophilic substitution but deactivate it towards nucleophilic substitution. However, the bromine atom itself is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which can slightly activate the ring for nucleophilic attack at its position. The methyl groups at positions 2 and 4 are ortho and para to the bromine, respectively, and their electron-donating effects may further enhance the reactivity of the bromine position.

Given the reaction conditions, it is plausible that the NH₂⁻ ion from NaNH₂ acts as a nucleophile, replacing the bromine atom at position 1 through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution mechanism. This would result in the formation of 1-amino-2,4-dimethylbenzene as the sole product. There are no other possible reaction pathways under these conditions, as elimination or rearrangement reactions are not feasible with the given structure and reagents.

Thus, the reaction produces only one organic product.
