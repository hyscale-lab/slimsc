Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. But I think the masses might not be directly relevant here since the question is about elemental abundances and the ratio of silicon atoms. So I'll focus on the abundance data given.

First, let me note down the given information:

- Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Also, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, what's the notation? [X/Y] means log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Oh wait, no, I think [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) minus log(nX/nY)_sun, right? Or wait, actually the definition is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY / (nX_sun / nY_sun)) ) → so equals log( (nX / nX_sun) / (nY / nY_sun) ) )

Alternatively, sometimes [X/Y] is defined as log(nX / nY) - log(nX_sun / nY_sun) ), which is same as log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) )

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0. That means log(nFe/nH)_star1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0 → so log(nFe/nH)_star1 = same as sun. So nFe/nH (star1) = nFe/nH (sun) = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg/nH)_star2 = same as sun. So nMg/nH (star2) = 10^(-5).

Now, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. I need to find nSi (star1) / nSi (star2).

Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe] for Star_2, only [Mg/Si] for Star_2. Hmm.

Let me think about each star one by one.

Starting with Star_1:

Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. This is log(nSi/nFe)_star1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

What's the Sun's [Si/Fe]? Let's compute that.

In the Sun, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). What about nSi/nH? I don't know, but perhaps I can get nSi/nFe from the star's [Si/Fe].

Wait, alternatively, let me compute [Si/Fe] for the Sun. Let's see, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe)_sun - log(nSi/nFe)_sun) = 0. Wait, no. Wait, the [X/Y] is defined with respect to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_sun is zero.

So for Star_1, [Si/
