Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here, since the question is about elemental abundances, specifically silicon in their photospheres.

The given data includes some abundance ratios. Let me jot them down:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [Si_Star1 / Si_Star2] or something like that.

I remember that the notation [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the Sun. The formula is [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_Sun. Or wait, is it (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_Sun? Because [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio relative to the solar ratio.

So, for example, if [X/Y] = 0, then the ratio is the same as the Sun. If it's positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun; if negative, less.

Given that, let's look at Star_1 first. [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_FeSun/n_HSun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log10(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log10(n_SiSun/n_FeSun) = 0.3. 

Wait, no. Wait, the definition of [X/Y] is log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) ). So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the star's X/Y to the solar X/Y.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log10( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) / (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) ) ) = 0.3. Which implies that (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 10^0.3.

I know the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5. So log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5). Wait, wait, but the way it's written, 12 + log(nFe/nH) equals 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)= -5. So nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but for Star_1, since [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_FeSun/n_HSun = 1e-4.5.

But I'm trying to find n_Si for each star and then take their ratio.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si1/n_Fe1 / (n_SiSun/n_FeSun)) ) = 0.3 → n_Si1/n_Fe1 = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 10^0.3.

We know n_SiSun/n_FeSun = (n_Si/n_H)Sun * (n_Fe/n_H)Sun^{-1} * (n_Fe/n_Si)Sun? Wait no, wait.

Wait, n_SiSun is the number density of Si in the Sun. Similarly for Fe.

So n_SiSun/n_FeSun = (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

Because (n_Si/n_H)_Sun is 12 + log10(n_Si/n_H) = some value. Wait, but in the given data for the Sun:

12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5 → log10(n_Fe/n_H) = -4.5 → n_Fe/n_H = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log10(n_Mg/n_H) =7 → log10(n_Mg/n_H) = -5 → n_Mg/n_H = 1e-5.

But what about n_Si/n_H in the Sun? It's not given. Hmm, so maybe I need to find it from other data.

Wait, perhaps we can use the Mg/Si ratio in Star_2. But Star_2's [Mg/Si] is 0.3, but let's handle each star one by one.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me calculate the ratio [Si/Fe] in each star and then relate it to their [Mg/H] and [Mg/Si] to find the overall abundance.

Wait, perhaps I should compute n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of n_H1 and n_H2, and then find (n_Si1 / n_Si2) * (n_H2 / n_H1). Wait, no, because the ratio would be (n_Si1/n_Si2)*(n_H2/n_H1) if looking for (n_Si1/n_Si2) * (n_H2/n_H1) ? Wait, no, because the photosphere's composition depends on the overall density perhaps.

Alternatively, since both stars' [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given, perhaps I can find their overall metallicity and then find the silicon abundance.

Wait, let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1: [Fe/H]1 = 0, which means [Fe/H] is zero. That implies that the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_FeSun/n_HSun.

But we also know that [Si/Fe]1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log10( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) / (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) ) = 0.3.

So, (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 10^0.3.

But (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) is (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

From Sun's data:

n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5), as before.

But what about n_Si/n_H in the Sun? Hmm, perhaps we can assume that in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is given by the data from Star_2? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, the Sun's composition includes Mg and Si. Since Star_2 has [Mg/Si]2 = 0.3, but I'm not sure if that helps with the Sun's [Mg/Si].

Wait, no. The Sun's [Mg/Si] is the same as any other star's if not given. But wait, the question provides the Sun's [Mg/H] as 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7, which gives nMg/nH = 1e-5. So for the Sun, nMg/nFe is (nMg/nH)/(nFe/nH) = (1e-5)/(1e-4.5) )= 0.3162 (approx 1e-0.5).

Wait, but that's the Sun's [Mg/Fe], perhaps. Because [Mg/Fe] = log10(nMg/nFe) - log10(nMg/nFe)_Sun.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to find n_Si/n_H in the Sun.

Wait, perhaps I can use the given data for Star_2 to find [Mg/Si]2, which is 0.3. But first, let's see:

Star_2 has [Mg/H]2 = 0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_MgSun/n_HSun = 1e-5.

Also, [Mg/Si]2 = 0.3 → log10( (n_Mg2/n_Si2) / (n_MgSun/n_SiSun) ) ) = 0.3.

So (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_MgSun/n_SiSun) * 10^0.3.

But n_Mg2/n_H2 is 1e-5. So n_Mg2 = n_H2 * 1e-5.

So (n_Mg2 / n_Si2) = (1e-5 n_H2) / n_Si2 = (n_MgSun / n_SiSun) * 1e0.3.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps me. Maybe I should compute n_Si2 in terms of n_H2.

Wait, let me go back to Star_1 first.

Star_1: n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_FeSun/n_HSun = 1e-4.5.

And from [Si/Fe]1 =0.3, so n_Si1/n_Fe1 = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 1e0.3.

Wait, but (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) is (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

Because n_Si/n_Fe = (n_Si/n_H) / (n_Fe/n_H) ).

So, [Si/Fe]1 = log10( (n_Si1/n_Fe1) / (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) ) ) = 0.3.

Which means (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 10^0.3.

Then, n_Si1 = (n_Fe1) * (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 10^0.3.

But n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

So n_Si1 = (n_H1 * (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun) * (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 1e0.3.

Wait, (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) is (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

So substituting that in:

n_Si1 = n_H1 * (n_FeSun/n_HSun) * (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * n_FeSun/n_HSun * 1e0.3 ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think again.

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * [ (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 1e0.3 ]

But n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

So substituting:

n_Si1 = [n_H1 * (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun ] * [ (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun ) ] * 1e0.3

Wait, because (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) = (n_Si/n_H)_Sun * (n_H/n_Fe)_Sun = (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

So substituting:

n_Si1 = n_H1 * (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun * [ (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun ) ] * 1e0.3.

The (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun terms cancel out.

So n_Si1 = n_H1 * (n_Si/n_H)_Sun * 1e0.3.

Hmm, that's interesting. So n_Si1 is (n_Si/n_H)_Sun * 1e0.3 times n_H1.

Wait, but n_Si/n_H in the Sun is not given. Oh wait, but perhaps I can compute it from other data. Because in the Sun, n_Mg/n_H is 1e-5, and n_Fe/n_H is 1e-4.5.

But to find n_Si/n_H in the Sun, perhaps we need some relation between Mg and Si. Wait, but the Sun's [Mg/Si] isn't given. Hmm, this is a problem because without that, I can't directly compute n_Si in the Sun.

Wait, perhaps the question doesn't require that because the stars' abundances are given in terms of [X/Fe] and [X/H], which might let me express n_Si in terms of n_H without needing the Sun's n_Si.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the ratio of [Si/Star1] and [Si/Star2] without knowing the Sun's n_Si.

Wait, let's think about the ratio of n_Si1 to n_Si2.

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1 / n_H1) * (n_H2 / n_Si2) )^{-1} ?

Wait, no. Wait, n_Si1/n_Si2 = [ (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) ] * (n_H2/n_H1).

Because:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1 * n_H2) / (n_Si2 * n_H1) ) = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1).

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) and then multiply by (n_H2/n_H1) to get n_Si1/n_Si2.

Wait, let me think again. The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres would be n_Si1/n_Si2. But since the photospheric composition is in a certain scale, perhaps I can express this in terms of their [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe], etc.

Wait, perhaps I can compute n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of n_H1 and n_H2, then take the ratio.

Let me compute for each star.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = ?

We know that [Fe/H]_1 is 0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_FeSun/n_HSun = 1e-4.5.

And [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 1e0.3.

So n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) * 1e0.3.

But n_SiSun is (n_Si/n_H)_Sun * n_HSun. Similarly, n_FeSun is (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun * n_HSun.

So n_SiSun/n_FeSun = (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun.

But I don't have (n_Si/n_H)_Sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the ratio of [Si/Fe] for Star_1 and Star_2 to find the ratio of their silicon abundances relative to hydrogen.

Wait, perhaps I can find their silicon-to-hydrogen ratios.

For Star_1:

n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * (n_Fe1/n_H1).

We know n_Si1/n_Fe1 is (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) *1e0.3.

And n_Fe1/n_H1 is (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun = 1e-4.5.

So:

n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) *1e0.3 * 1e-4.5.

But again, I don't know (n_SiSun/n_FeSun). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) in terms of other solar abundances.

Wait, from the Sun's data, n_Fe/n_H =1e-4.5, n_Mg/n_H=1e-5.

But we don't have direct info on n_Si/n_H in the Sun. Unless we can find it using [Mg/Si] from Star_2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the stellar atmospheres having LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), and using the EW method. But I'm not sure how that affects the elemental abundances beyond what's given.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2.

For Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 = 0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_MgSun/n_HSun = 1e-5.

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_MgSun/n_SiSun) *1e0.3.

So,

n_Mg2 = n_Si2 * (n_MgSun / n_SiSun) *1e0.3.

But n_Mg2 = n_H2 * (n_Mg/n_H)_Sun = n_H2 *1e-5.

So,

n_H2 *1e-5 = n_Si2 * (n_MgSun / n_SiSun) *1e0.3.

Rearranging,

n_Si2 = (n_H2 *1e-5) / [ (n_MgSun / n_SiSun) *1e0.3 ) ].

But again, I'm stuck because I don't know n_SiSun, the solar silicon abundance.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 can be expressed in terms of their [Fe/H] and [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can find (n_Si1/n_Si2) by considering their relations.

Let me think:

n_Si1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * n_Fe1.

Similarly, n_Si2 = (n_Si2/n_Mg2) * n_Mg2.

Wait, but I don't have [Si/Mg] for Star_2. I have [Mg/Si] for Star_2. So [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_MgSun/n_SiSun) * 1e0.3.

Which can be rearranged to (n_Si2/n_Mg2) = (n_SiSun/n_MgSun) * 1e-0.3.

So, n_Si2 = n_Mg2 * (n_SiSun/n_MgSun) *1e-0.3.

But n_Mg2 = n_H2 * (n_Mg/n_H)_Sun = n_H2 *1e-5.

So, n_Si2 = n_H2 *1e-5 * (n_SiSun/n_MgSun) *1e-0.3.

Hmm.

Similarly, for Star_1, n_Si1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * n_Fe1.

And [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) *1e0.3.

n_Fe1 = n_H1 * (n_Fe/n_H)_Sun = n_H1 *1e-4.5.

So, n_Si1 = n_H1 *1e-4.5 * (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) *1e0.3.

Now, taking the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2:

= [ (n_H1 *1e-4.5 * (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) *1e0.3) ] / [ (n_H2 *1e-5 * (n_SiSun/n_MgSun) *1e-0.3) ) ]

Simplify this:

= (n_H1 / n_H2) * (1e-4.5 / 1e-5) * [ (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) / (n_SiSun/n_MgSun) ) ] * (1e0.3 / 1e-0.3)

Simplify each term:

(n_H1/n_H2): since both stars are in LTE, their overall hydrogen densities are probably the same? Or no, because their masses are different. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Wait, the photospheric composition is about the ratios, not the absolute densities. Wait, perhaps the ratio n_H1/n_H2 is the same as the ratio of their total densities, but I don't know if that's the case.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I'm missing a simpler approach.

Wait, perhaps since [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Fe/H]_2 isn't given, but [Mg/H]_2 =0, which could imply something about their metallicity.

Wait, [Fe/H] is a measure of metal abundance. So Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, same as the Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, same as the Sun for Mg. But what about Fe in Star_2? Since only [Mg/H] is given, perhaps the metallicity is such that Mg is solar, but Fe could be different.

Wait, but the question is about the silicon abundance, not metallicity. So perhaps I can find [Si/H] for each star and then compute their ratio.

But how?

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si1/n_Fe1) = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun) *1e0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 =0, n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_FeSun/n_HSun.

So, n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_Si1/n_Fe1) * (n_Fe1/n_H1) = (n_SiSun/n_FeSun *1e0.3) * (n_FeSun/n_HSun).

Which simplifies to (n_SiSun/n_HSun) ) *1e0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 = log10( n_Si1/n_H1 / (n_SiSun/n_HSun) ) = log10( (n_SiSun/n_HSun *1e0.3) / (n_SiSun/n_HSun) ) ) = log10(1e0.3) ) = 0.3.

So, [Si/H]_1 is 0.3.

That's useful. So, Star_1 has [Si/H] =0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, can I find [Si/H]_2?

Well, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (n_Mg2/n_Si2) = (n_MgSun/n_SiSun) *1e0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 =0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 =n_MgSun/n_HSun =1e-5.

So, n_Mg2 = n_H2 *1e-5.

Substituting into the [Mg/Si] equation:

(n_H2 *1e-5) / n_Si2 = (n_MgSun/n_SiSun) *1e0.3.

Rearranged:

n_Si2 = (n_H2 *1e-5) / ( (n_MgSun/n_SiSun) *1e0.3 )

But n_MgSun/n_SiSun = (n_Mg/n_H)_Sun / (n_Si/n_H)_Sun.

Which is (1e-5) / (n_Si/n_H)_Sun.

So,

n_Si2 = (n_H2 *1e-5) / ( (1e-5 / (n_Si/n_H)_Sun) ) *1e-0.3 )

Wait, maybe I should express this as:

n_Si2 = (n_H2 *1e-5) * (n_Si/n_H)_Sun / (1e-5) ) *1e-0.3.

The 1e-5 cancels, so:

n_Si2 = n_H2 * (n_Si/n_H)_Sun * 1e-0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = log10( n_Si2/n_H2 / (n_SiSun/n_HSun) ) = log10( (n_Si/n_H)_Sun *1e-0.3 / (n_Si/n_H)_Sun ) ) = log10(1e-0.3) )= -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

Now I have [Si/H] for both stars:

Star_1: [Si/H] =0.3.

Star_2: [Si/H] =-0.3.

Wait, but what does this mean for the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres?

Wait, the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) would be (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1).

But the [Si/H] is log10( (n_Si/n_H) / (n_SiSun/n_HSun) ).

So,

n_Si1/n_H1 = (n_SiSun/n_HSun) *10^0.3.

n_Si2/n_H2 = (n_SiSun/n_HSun) *10^-0.3.

So,

(n_Si1/n_Si2) = [ (n_SiSun/n_HSun *1e0.3 ) / (n_SiSun/n_HSun *1e-0.3 ) ) ] * (n_H2/n_H1 )

Which simplifies to [1e^(0.3 +0.3) ] * (n_H2/n_H1 )

= 1e^0.6 * (n_H2/n_H1 )

Wait, but I don't know n_H1 and n_H2. Are they the same? Not necessarily. Because the stars have different masses, their overall densities could vary, but the photospheric composition is about the abundance ratios, not the absolute densities. Hmm.

Wait, but in the photosphere, the hydrogen density is probably the same scale for each star, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio n_H1/n_H2 is 1, but that's an assumption.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, which would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2 ) * (n_H2 / n_H1 ), unless I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, if I'm considering the ratio of silicon atoms (n_Si1) to (n_Si2), but each in their respective photospheres, which have different total number densities of hydrogen (n_H1 and n_H2), then the actual number of silicon atoms would depend on both the abundance and the overall density. But without knowing the absolute densities, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of (n_Si1/n_Si2) is the same as (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2), which would mean the ratio is (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Wait, because:

n_Si1/n_H1 = 10^0.3 * (n_SiSun/n_HSun)

n_Si2/n_H2 = 10^-0.3 * (n_SiSun/n_HSun)

So,

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) = (10^0.3) / (10^-0.3) ) = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Which is approximately 3.98, which is option A (~3.9).

But wait, does that make sense? Because if Star_1 has [Si/H]=+0.3 and Star_2 has [Si/H]=-0.3, then Star_1 has more silicon relative to hydrogen than the Sun, and Star_2 has less. So the ratio would be 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) ) = 10^0.6.

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio (n_Si1/n_Si2) is (10^0.3 / 10^-0.3) )= 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Wait, but the options don't have 3.98. Option A is ~3.9, which is close. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So n_Si1 / n_Si2 = 10^0.6, which is about 3.98. So the correct answer is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze their elemental abundances and use the given data:

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - Solar photospheric composition:  
     \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \implies n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - Solar photospheric composition:  
     \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \implies n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

3. The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}}.
   \]

### Step 1: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_1
From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 and [Fe/H]_1 = 0:
\[
\text{[Si/Fe]} = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, Sun}}}\right) = 0.3.
\]
This implies:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}}}{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}/n_{\text{Fe, Sun}}} = 10^{0.3}.
\]
Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe, Sun}}/n_{\text{H, Sun}} \). Therefore:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{[Si/H]}_1 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}/n_{\text{H, Sun}}}\right) = 0.3.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate [Si/H] for Star_2
From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0:
\[
\text{[Mg/Si]} = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Mg, Sun}}/n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}\right) = 0.3.
\]
This implies:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Mg, Sun}}/n_{\text{Si, Sun}}} = 10^{0.3}.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si}}}{n_{\text{Mg}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{Mg, Sun}}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
\]
Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg, Sun}}/n_{\text{H, Sun}} \). Therefore:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}}{n_{\text{H, Sun}}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{[Si/H]}_2 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{Si, Sun}}/n_{\text{H, Sun}}}\right) = -0.3.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Silicon Atoms
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} = \frac{10^{0.3}}{10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Using \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
