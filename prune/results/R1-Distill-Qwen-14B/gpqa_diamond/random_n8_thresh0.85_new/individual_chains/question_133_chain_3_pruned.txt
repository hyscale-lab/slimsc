Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing potassium hydrogen phosphate and sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Hmm, okay.

Wait, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details. So, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. There's 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium salt. Oh, and the temperature is 25°C. They also give the three Ka values for H3PO4: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

The question asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I'm looking for [PO4^3-] in the solution.

I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, it creates a buffer solution. The same goes for their salts. So in this case, the KH2PO4 is probably acting as the acid, and Na2HPO4 as the conjugate base? Or wait, maybe I'm getting that backwards.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When dissolved, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- can act as an acid because it can donate a proton (H+) to become HPO4^2-.

On the other hand, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. HPO4^2- can act as both an acid and a base. It can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These two are conjugate acid-base pairs. Wait, the HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-, right? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So this is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. Since we have both the acid and its conjugate base, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the solution. Once I have the pH, I can determine the concentration of PO4^3-.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). Which pKa should I use here? Well, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base. So pKa would be the second dissociation step of H3PO4, which is Ka2 = 6.2e-8. Because H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+, so that's the second ionization.

So first, let's calculate the moles of each component.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.

Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007335 mol. So approximately 0.007335 moles of H2PO4^-.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005612 mol. So approximately 0.005612 moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait a second. Does the dihydrate affect the molar mass in any way that we need to account for here? No, because the molar mass given already includes the water. So we can proceed as is.

Now, since the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, the concentrations of the ions would be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007335 / 0.2 = 0.036675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005612 / 0.2 = 0.02806 M.

Wait, but wait. In solution, each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-, and each mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-. So the concentrations are as I calculated.

Now, applying Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-])

Ka2 is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, pKa is -log10(Ka). So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208.

Then, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02806 / 0.036675 ≈ 0.7653.

So log(0.7653) ≈ -0.113.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.113 ≈ 7.095.

So the pH is about 7.095.

Now, to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, which comes from the third dissociation step of H3PO4.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 is given as 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

Wait, but the pH of the solution is about 7.1, which is lower than pKa3 of
