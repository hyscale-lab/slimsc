Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and nu (presumably a neutrino). The pion is initially at rest. The rest masses are provided: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options given are A to D, each with two energies, probably the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a particle physics problem. I remember that in such decay processes, conservation laws apply—specifically, conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is stationary, the initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. Oh wait, in the Standard Model, neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass compared to other particles, but I think for the sake of this problem, we'll treat them as massless. Or wait, maybe the muon neutrino has some mass? Or perhaps in this context, it's treated as massless to simplify the calculation. I'll proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's mass is negligible.

So, let's think about the energies involved. The pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. When it decays, the total energy of the muon and neutrino should add up to the same 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the muon has its rest mass, so its total energy will be more than that. Let's break down the energy and momentum.

The total energy of the system after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total momentum should be zero because the pion was at rest.

Let me denote the energies of the muon and neutrino as E_mu and E_nu, and their momenta as p_mu and p_nu.

Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to the magnitude of its momentum times c, but since we're working in units where c=1 (as is common in particle physics), E_nu = |p_nu|.

Similarly, for the muon, its energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, the total energy E_mu is the sum of rest mass energy (m_mu c²) and kinetic energy (K_mu). But since the muon has rest mass, the energy is related to its momentum by E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, units can get confusing, but in natural units where c=1, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ).

But let's think in natural units where c=1, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momenta in MeV/c, but since c=1, they are in MeV.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equations
