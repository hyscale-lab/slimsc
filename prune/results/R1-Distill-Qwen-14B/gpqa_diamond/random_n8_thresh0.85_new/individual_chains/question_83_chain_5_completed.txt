Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titrations and pH calculations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³.

So, the initial concentration (C1) is 0.05 M, and the volume (V1) is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ water, the new volume (V2) is 40 cm³. Using the dilution formula C1V1 = C2V2, I can calculate C2.

Let me compute that. C2 = (C1 * V1) / V2. So that's (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let's see: 0.05 *20 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find two pH values: at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me start with the equivalence point. For an acid-base titration, at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So, the moles of acetic acid initially would be (volume in liters) * molarity. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M. Moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

Since the stoichiometry is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence are also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't asking about the volume needed, but the pH at equivalence.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has become acetate ions (CH3COO^-). So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

To find the pH, I need to calculate the Kb for the acetate ion. Since Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, Kw is 1e-14, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5. Let me compute that.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. So Kb is approximately 5.405e-10.

The concentration of the acetate ion at equivalence is the moles divided by the total solution volume. The moles of acetate will be 0.001 mol (from the neutralization reaction), and the total volume is the original 40 cm³ plus the 10 cm³ of NaOH added. So 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, using the Kb expression: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], then:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] is approximately 1.04e-5 M.

Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait a second, none of the options are around 9.02. Hmm. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation or the concentration. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid was 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 mol. Correct. At equivalence, all of that becomes acetate, 0.001 mol. Then volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = (1e-9)/1.85 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

Setting up the equation Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). But since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so approximation x² ≈ Kb * 0.02.

Wait, no, the expression is x² / (0.02) = 5.405e-10. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

Wait, pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14-4.98=9.02. But the options don't have anything close to that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

B: 3.17; 6.73

C:4.73;7.00

D:4.57;6.92

Hmm. So none of the options have around 9. That's a problem. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think again.

Wait, when you have a weak acid and you titrate it with a strong base, at equivalence point you have the conjugate base. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is a basic solution. But perhaps I made a mistake in the concentration.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate the acetate concentration.

After adding 10 cm³ of NaOH (0.01 L) to 40 cm³ of the diluted acetic acid solution, the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L).

Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

Concentration: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact expression without the approximation. Let's see:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10. Assume x is small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. Then x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. x ≈ 1.04e-5, as before.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is ~4.98, pH is ~9.02. None of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, maybe the equivalence point isn't at 10 cm³. Wait, wait: the initial acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³. The moles are 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So, yes, 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH (0.01 L * 0.1 = 0.001 mol) would neutralize that. So the concentration is correct. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1e-9) / 1.85 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the acetate concentration. Alternatively, perhaps I should not have included the NaOH volume in the solution volume. But no, because when you mix the two solutions, the total volume is additive. So 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. So that's right.

Wait, maybe I should consider that sodium acetate dissociates completely, so the solution is 0.02 M in acetate, but perhaps I should also account for the sodium ions, but sodium is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH. So that's okay.

Hmm. So my calculation gives pH at equivalence point as ~9.02, but none of the options go that high. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't about the strong base titration but something else. Wait, no. It's NaOH, which is a strong base.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should have considered the dilution before the titration. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20 cm³ water. So the diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should approach the equivalence point using the formula for a weak base solution. The formula is pH = pKb^-1 + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, at equivalence, the solution is a pure base. Alternatively, the pH can be calculated using the Kb and concentration.

Wait, I think I did that correctly. So maybe the problem is in the part about the 25% titration point, not the equivalence point. Let me think about that.

25% titration: So 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So I need to find the pH at this point.

First, let me find out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration. The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol.

The volume of NaOH added is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

So the total solution volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized, producing acetate ions. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of CH3COOH remaining are initial moles minus moles reacted. Initial moles: 0.001; reacted: 0.00025. Remaining: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- produced: 0.00025 mol.

So in the solution, we have 0.00075 mol of acetic acid and 0.00025 mol of acetate ion.

The total volume is 42.5 cm³. So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that.

1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5. Taking log: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 = approx 0.333.

Log(0.333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which is around 4.26. That's one of the options.

Looking back at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.26.

But wait, earlier I found the equivalence point pH to be around 9.02, which isn't in any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in that part.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach for the equivalence point. The solution is 0.02 M acetate ion, with Kb = 5.405e-10.

The formula for a weak base is [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C). So:

[OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M. Wait, wait, no—wait, 5.405e-10 multiplied by 0.02 is 1.081e-11. The square root is about 1.04e-5 M, which gives [OH^-] =1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02. But none of the options go that high.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. The Kb is 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Set up the ICE table:

Initial: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M; [CH3COOH] = 0; [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

Equilibrium: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02; [CH3COOH] = x; [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

So x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Hmm. So the equivalence pH is 9.02, but the options don't have that. The option A has 8.52, which is lower than my calculation. What's going on here?

Wait, maybe I mixed up the initial concentrations. Let me recheck: initial moles after dilution is 0.001 mol. When titrated, we add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, which is 0.001 mol of NaOH. So the moles of acetate are 0.001 mol. The total volume is 50 cm³, so concentration is 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should not have used the Kb but the pKa. No, because at equivalence point, we have the conjugate base, so using Kb is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use an approximation that the pH is 7 at the equivalence point, but that's only true for strong acid-strong base titrations. For weak acids, the pH is basic, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³.

So, moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

Yes, correct. So the diluted concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So why am I getting a pH of ~9 at equivalence, but the options don't go that high? Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. That's much lower than 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the concentration of the solution before adding any NaOH. Let me think: when I titrate 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid, the initial pH is when no NaOH is added. But the question isn't about that; it's about the pH at 25% titration and equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that at equivalence, the solution is a buffer? No, no, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so it's just the acetate ion in solution.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the buffer region.

Wait, another approach to the equivalence point: since the solution is a weak base (acetate), perhaps I can calculate the pH correctly using the exact formula.

But I think I did that correctly earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the equivalence point, but maybe the options are considering that the solution is more dilute. Wait, no, I accounted for the total volume.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is being treated as a strong acid titration, but no, acetic acid is weak.

Wait, perhaps the Kb is being calculated incorrectly. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kw = 1e-14 → Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 1e-9 / 1.85 ≈ 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me see the options again. Option D says equivalence pH is 6.92. That's around 7, which is neutral. But for a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence pH should be higher than 7, not lower.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation for the equivalence point and used pKa instead of pKb?

Let me try that. If I mistakenly used pKa, then pKa is 4.733. So pH would be 4.733, but that's the initial pH before titration, not at equivalence. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the equivalence point. Let me think: perhaps the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. So 50 cm³ is 0.05 L. Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, perhaps in the initial problem statement, the volumes are in liters or cm³? No, the volumes are given in cm³, which I converted correctly to liters.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to find out the pH of the equivalence point using another method. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use an approximate approach.

Wait, another approach: the pH at equivalence for a weak acid and a strong base is given by:

pH = (pKa + pKw) / 2.

Wait, why would that be? Because at equivalence, the solution is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it's a basic solution. The pH would be higher than 7.

Wait, wait, I think the formula is pH = (pKa + pKb)/2, but that's not right. Alternatively, it's pH = pKw - pKa/2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The pH at equivalence for a weak acid titrated by a strong base is determined by the concentration of the conjugate base.

But I think I had the correct approach earlier. So perhaps the issue is that the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the 25% titration calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the 25% titration. At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. 25% reacted: 0.00025 mol. So moles unreacted: 0.00075 mol, and moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.733.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256, which rounds to 4.26. That's correct. So the first part of the answer is 4.26.

Now, looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So the equivalence point pH would be 8.52 according to option A. But my calculation earlier gave around 9.02, which isn't present.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the volume of NaOH used is not 10 cm³. Wait, initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when adding NaOH, the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. So acetate concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the exact expression without the approximation. Let me try that.

The Kb expression is:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assume x is much smaller than 0.02. Let's solve it without approximation.

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x)

x² = 5.405e-10 (0.02 - x)

x² = 1.081e-11 - 5.405e-10 x.

Rearranging:

x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

This is a quadratic equation. Let me write it as:

x² + (5.405e-10) x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a

Here, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) = (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) = approximately 4.324e-11 (since 2.92e-19 is negligible).

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root:

x ≈ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

Wait, wait a minute. That's different from the earlier result. Earlier I had x ≈ 1.04e-5. Now it's 3.288e-6. Which is about 3.29e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.29e-6. Then pOH is -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.485. So pH is 14 -5.485 =8.515, which is approximately 8.52.

Ah! So that's where option A gets 8.52 for the equivalence point. But why the difference? Because earlier I assumed x is negligible compared to 0.02, but perhaps the approximation isn't valid here. Wait, let me check the value of x compared to 0.02.

x is about 3.29e-6, which is 3.29e-6 M. 0.02 M is 2e-2 M. So 3.29e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should hold. But why the discrepancy in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the quadratic approach.

Wait, let's recompute the discriminant correctly.

Compute D: (5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 = 29.214e-20 = 2.9214e-19.

4ac = 4 * 1 * (-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. Wait no, in the quadratic formula, it's 4ac where c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac =4 *1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11.

Wait, D is b² -4ac. Because the equation is x² + bx + c=0, so a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

So D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11).

Which is (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) = approximately 4.324e-11. So sqrt(D) is 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 = 3.288e-6.

Wait, so [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 M. So pOH is -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485. pH is 14 -5.485 = 8.515, which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is 8.52.

But earlier, when I used the approximation, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5, leading to pH=9.02, which is not matching any options. But with the exact calculation, pH is ~8.52, which matches option A.

So why the discrepancy? Because the approximation assumes x is negligible, which may not be the case. Let me check the value of x compared to 0.02. x is 3.288e-6, which is 0.003288% of 0.02. So it's about 0.003%—negligible. So why did the exact calculation give a different result?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I should set it up correctly. The Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = Kb.

In the exact calculation, [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 - x, which is approximately 0.02. But when I solved the equation without approximation, I got x=3.288e-6.

Wait, perhaps I should plug this x back into the expression to see if it matches Kb.

So Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 -x) = (3.288e-6)^2 / (0.02 - 3.288e-6) ≈ (1.081e-11) / (0.019996712) ≈ 5.405e-10. Which matches the Kb value.

So the correct [OH^-] is 3.288e-6, leading to pH 8.52.

Ah! So earlier, I must have made a mistake in the initial approach. I think I confused the Kb expression.

Wait, why did the initial approximation give me x=1.04e-5, leading to pH=9.02, but the exact solution gives x=3.288e-6, pH=8.52?

Ah, perhaps I confused the Kb expression. Wait, no. The Kb is 5.405e-10, and the expression is correct. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approximation. Let me recompute the approximation.

The Kb is 5.405e-10, and [CH3COO^-] is 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. But according to the exact solution, x is about 3.29e-6, which is a third of 1.04e-5.

Wait, that can't be. What's wrong here?

Wait, I think I see the mistake. Oh no! The Kb expression is [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = Kb.

But in the approximation, I assumed [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02, which is correct. So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

But this leads to [OH^-] =1.04e-5, which gives pH=9.02, but the exact calculation gives [OH^-]=3.288e-6 and pH=8.52.

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation. Let me re-solve the quadratic equation.

The equation is x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a.

Wait, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So D = b² -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = 2.921e-19 + 4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D)= approx 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10) /2 ≈ 6.576e-6 / 2 = 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515.

But when I used the approximation, I got [OH^-]=1.04e-5 → pH=9.02.

Wait, but this can't be right. The exact solution should give a more accurate result. So why the discrepancy?

Ah! I think I've made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-express the Kb expression.

The correct expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

[CH3COOH] = x.

[OH^-] = x.

So the equation becomes:

x^2 / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

If x is much smaller than 0.02, then 0.02 -x ≈0.02, so x^2≈5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x≈1.04e-5, leading to [OH^-]=1.04e-5, pH=9.02.

But according to the exact calculation, x=3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation should hold. But the exact solution contradicts that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should plug x=1.04e-5 back into the Kb expression.

(1.04e-5)^2 / (0.02 -1.04e-5) = (1.081e-10) / 0.0199896 ≈ 5.405e-9. Which is much larger than the Kb of 5.405e-10. So that's incorrect.

So the correct approach is to solve the quadratic equation, which gives x=3.288e-6, leading to [OH^-]=3.288e-6, pH=8.52.

But why is the approximation giving a wrong result? Because in reality, x is not negligible compared to 0.02? But 3.288e-6 is much smaller than 0.02. So why does the approximation give a wrong answer?

Wait, perhaps the approximation isn't accurate enough because x is not negligible. Let me compute 3.288e-6 compared to 0.02. 3.288e-6 is 0.003288% of 0.02. So it's about 0.003% of 0.02. So the error introduced by the approximation should be negligible. So why does the exact solution give a different result?

I think I must have made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me recheck.

Wait, the quadratic equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 =0.

The solution is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)] / 2a.

Wait, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c=-1.081e-11.

So D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4*(1)*(1.081e-11).

Wait a minute, because the equation is x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

So when applying the quadratic formula, it's x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / 2a.

Wait, but in this case, 4ac =4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11.

So D = (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) = (5.405e-10)^2 +4.324e-11.

Which is about 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 = approx 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)=6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 = (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10) / 2 ≈ (6.576e-6)/2 =3.288e-6.

But when I plug x=3.288e-6 into Kb, I get:

(3.288e-6)^2 / (0.02 -3.288e-6) = (1.081e-11) / (0.01999671) ≈ 5.405e-10. Which matches Kb.

So the exact solution seems correct, which gives pH=8.52.

So why earlier did the approximation give pH=9.02? Because I thought x was 1.04e-5, but that can't be correct because it leads to a Kb value that's much larger than expected.

Wait, perhaps I confused the initial assumption. Let me recompute the approximation without the mistake.

Wait, the correct setup is x^2 = Kb * (0.02 -x).

If x is much smaller than 0.02, then 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈1.04e-5.

But then [OH^-]=1.04e-5, pH=9.02, which is higher than the exact solution.

But according to the exact calculation, [OH^-] is 3.288e-6, which is much lower than 1.04e-5. So why the discrepancy? Because the initial approximation is not accurate.

But wait, if x is 3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, the approximation should be valid, but why does it lead to a different result?

I think I'm getting stuck here, but let's proceed with the correct exact value, which gives pH=8.52 at equivalence.

So the 25% titration pH is 4.26, and the equivalence point pH is 8.52. Which matches option A.

But wait, earlier when I considered the 25% titration, I found pH=4.26, which is correct. So the answer would be option A: 4.26;8.52.

But let me check the options again. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that's the correct pair.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). Using the dilution formula \( C_1V_1 = C_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
C_2 = \frac{C_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 0.02}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, 0.25% of the moles of acetic acid have reacted:

\[
\text{Moles reacted} = 0.001 \times 0.25 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles unreacted} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion formed are equal to the moles of NaOH added:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.5 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \), and the ratio \( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.333 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x},
\]

where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \). Assuming \( x \ll 0.02 \), we approximate:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.485.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.485 = 8.515 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**.
