Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think about this.

First, I should sketch the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so numbering is a bit tricky. Let me imagine the structure: 2-(tert-butyl) would be at position 2, 1-ethoxy at position 1, and 3-nitro at position 3. Wait, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 would be adjacent, but wait, that's not possible because having substituents at 1, 2, and 3 would mean they are all meta to each other? Wait, no, if the ring is numbered such that substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that would imply they are adjacent. But wait, wait, 2 is next to 1 and 3, so probably the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that each is adjacent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents:

- Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) is at position 1.
- tert-Butyl group is at position 2.
- Nitro group is at position 3.

So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, but in benzene, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, so it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. I'm a bit confused because that's a lot of substituents close together, but the question is about the reaction sequence.

So the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Wait, wait, the numbering could be different. Let me think again. If substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, but perhaps not all on the same face. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they are all ortho to each other
