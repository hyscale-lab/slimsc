Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen is used to reduce ketones to alkanes, right? So the reaction should involve a carbonyl group getting reduced.

Looking at the data given:

The IR spectrum shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably a ketone or aldehyde. There's also 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

The 1H NMR data is more detailed. Let's go through it.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which usually suggests an acidic proton, like a phenolic -OH. But wait, if the compound has a carbonyl, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that would be a sharp peak around 9-10 ppm. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but if it's a ketone, then no. Alternatively, an acidic proton like -COOH would have a broad peak, but the 1720 cm-1 is more of a C=O that's not an acid because of the higher wavenumber. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which is broad. The IR here has the 3400–2500, which might include an O-H. Hmm, but the peak at 1720 could still be a ketone. If it's a carbonyl and an O-H, maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with a phenolic group? Or perhaps it's a ketone with an acidic proton elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm. If it's a proton next to an electron-withdrawing group, maybe like an aldehyde (but aldehydes are usually less than 10 ppm, more like 9-10?), wait no, sometimes they can be a bit higher. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak around 10-12, but then the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 3000. Let me think.

Looking again: the IR has 3400–2500, which is a broad range. That's typical for an O-H stretch, especially for an alcohol or carboxylic acid. But wait, if the compound has a carbonyl and an O-H, perhaps it's a ketone and an acidic proton like in a phenol? Because phenols have O-H which is broad. So, let's consider that the compound has both an aromatic ring (from the IR peaks at 1610 and 1450) and a ketone (1720 cm-1), plus a phenolic group (O-H).

The NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, 1H): Probably the O-H from a phenol group. But wait, if it's a phenol, the aromatic protons would be split into certain patterns. Let's see the other aromatic signals.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The two doublets each integrating for 2H suggest substitution at the para positions. So, maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents? Or perhaps one substituent that's itself a group which causes the doublets.

Wait, but the integration is 2H for each. So, perhaps it's ortho to the substituent. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the protons on either side would each be a doublet. Or, alternatively, if it's a meta substitution, but that usually gives more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is in the para position relative to each other.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring is para-substituted with a group that has two substituents. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple para-disubstituted benzene, but that would have more than two sets of protons. Hmm, wait, maybe it's a meta substituent, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is such that it deshields the protons into two doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. For example, a group at position
