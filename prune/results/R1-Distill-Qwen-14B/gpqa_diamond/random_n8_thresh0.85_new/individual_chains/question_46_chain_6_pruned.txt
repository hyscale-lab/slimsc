Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually Rh or Ru-based, that facilitates this process. From what I've studied, Grubbs is good for ring-closing metathesis and cross metathesis, but in this case, since we're dealing with a single alkene, it might undergo some kind of ring-forming or dimerization.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no. Wait, for pent-1-ene, it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. The pentene chain is five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-C(H)(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me number them. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the double bond is between 1 and 2. Position 3 is the third carbon, so it's CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-... No
