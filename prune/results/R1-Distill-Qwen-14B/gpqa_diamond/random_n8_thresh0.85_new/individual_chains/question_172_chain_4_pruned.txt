Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, Boltzmann's equation relates the relative populations of two energy states to the temperature and the energy difference between them.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Wait, so the excitation is higher in star_1. Oh wait, but I need to think about the ratio. Let me clarify: the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level. Or is it that the energy level is twice as excited? Maybe I should read that again. Oh, the iron atoms are twice as excited in star_1's photosphere compared to star_2. So the excitation is higher in star_1.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but wait, the specific energy level's excitation is about that. Hmm, but I think the exact energy difference might not be needed since the ratio is given. Because the question is about the relation between temperatures, not the actual values.

So, Boltzmann's equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (n_upper and n_lower) is given by (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But wait, if the specific energy level has a given excitation, perhaps we're comparing the same level in both stars, so the energy difference is the same for both. So the ratio of excitation in star_1 (n1) to star_2 (n2) is given as 2:1. So n1/n2 = 2.

Assuming the statistical weights g are the same for both stars (same element, same energy levels), then the ratio becomes exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ) ) = n1/n2 * (g1/g2). Since g is same, it's 2.

Wait, let me rephrase. For each star, the excitation ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1: n1 = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) * C, and same for star 2, n2 = (same g's) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) * C. So the ratio n1/n2 = exp[ (-ΔE/(k T1)) + (ΔE/(k T2)) ] because when you divide the two exponentials, their exponents add as a subtraction. Alternatively, it's exp(ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] ), because ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )= ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )? Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

So n1/n2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp( [ (-ΔE)/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ]) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) [ (1/(T2) ) - (1/(T1) ) ] )

Simplify that expression: exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = n1/n2.

Given that n1/n2 is 2, so ln(2) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, because taking the natural log of both sides: ln(n1/n2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So ln(2) = (ΔE / k) [ (1 / T2) - (1 / T1) )

Hmm, but I don't know the value of k (Boltzmann's constant). Oh wait, but in the options, I don't see any mention of k or ΔE. So perhaps the equation is being rearranged to express the relation between T1 and T2, assuming that ΔE is the same for both stars.

Wait, maybe I can rearrange the equation: ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, the problem gives the energy difference ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. I wonder if that's a clue. Wait, Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh! So ΔE = k * T * something. Wait, in the equation, ΔE is multiplied by (1/T2 - 1/T1), and k is in the denominator.

Let me compute the left side: ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

If ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K, then ΔE/k = (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) ) = 1 K. So ln(2) = 1 * (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) → ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, so rearranging, 1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2)

Wait, can I express this in terms of T1 and T2?

Let me write that as  (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2) ?

Wait, wait. Let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So yeah, that's correct. So ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So the equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which looks correct.

But wait, wait, let me make sure. The ratio we have is n1/n2 = 2. So, in the equation, ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), which with ΔE = k, gives ln(2) = (1)(1/T2 - 1
