Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and I need to determine which one is the result of that reaction.

First, I should look at the spectral data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data will give me clues about the structure of X, which will help me figure out what reaction it undergoes.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1. Let's break these down.

The broad peak between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 is likely due to an O-H stretch. Since it's broad, it might be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But wait, if there's an O-H, a carboxylic acid would have both a strong O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (around 1700). However, the 1720 is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid, which is around 1700. Maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Hmm, but the O-H could also be from an alcohol, which would have a peak around 3400, but the 1720 would then be a ketone. Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl?

Looking at the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks. Those are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So Compound X probably has an aromatic ring, possibly with substituents that affect the carbonyl.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet, possibly an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually around 10-12 ppm, and it's a broad peak. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but that's usually a triplet or something else. So maybe a carboxylic acid proton here.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons. Doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe para-substituted aromatic ring because two protons are equivalent, each coupled to one another. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also a doublet. This would fit with a para-substituted ring where the substituents are in the para positions, like a substituent with two sets of doublets. So, perhaps a substituted benzene with groups in the para positions.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for one proton. This could be a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to something else, or maybe a CH group connected to an electronegative atom. Maybe part of a ketone or ester group?

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet for two protons. Likely part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or in a chain, perhaps in a branched structure.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet. That's typical for a methyl group attached to something, like a CH(CH3) group. So maybe a CH(CH3) group adjacent to another CH2 or something else.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, likely a terminal methyl group, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the NMR suggests an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions. Let's imagine a benzene ring where two substituents are present, each in the para position. One substituent might be a carbonyl group (from the IR) and another might be a branched alkyl group.

Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, so perhaps it's a ketone or an ester. But the O-H at 10.5 ppm is confusing. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700, but here it's at 1720. Alternatively, maybe an ester, where the carbonyl is around 1720, but then where is the O-H? Wait, esters don't have O-H groups. So maybe this is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the NMR would usually have a broad O-H peak, which is present here. The 1720 in IR could be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe a benzoic acid? Benzoic acid has a carbonyl around 1680-1700, but the 1720 suggests maybe an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's not a carboxylic acid. Let me think again. The O-H at 10.5 ppm could be something else, perhaps an aldehyde proton? No, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but that's a singlet. So maybe a phenoxide or another type of O-H?

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol. But in that case, the carbonyl at 1720 would be a ketone. So, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ketone with an adjacent alcohol group. But the O-H in an alcohol is usually less downfield than a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is not from a carboxylic acid but from an enol? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a phenol group. Phenol O-H is around 5 ppm, but this is at 10.5, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from an aldehyde but it's part of an alpha,beta-unsaturated system. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the O-H could be from a conjugated carbonyl, like a cinnamic acid type structure, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is not O-H but an aldehyde? No, because aldehyde protons are usually singlets and around 9-10. So if it's a doublet at 10.5, perhaps it's something else. Maybe an aromatic proton with some coupling, but that would usually be in the 7-8 ppm region.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid, and the 1720 is the carbonyl of that acid. But the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually broad, which matches the '
