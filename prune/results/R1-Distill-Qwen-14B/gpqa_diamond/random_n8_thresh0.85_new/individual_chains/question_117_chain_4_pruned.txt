Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which makes them chiral. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds show this property.

The question lists four organic moieties, numbered 1 to 4. I need to analyze each one to see if they have any chiral centers or other sources of asymmetry leading to stereoisomerism. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: Let's break this down. The structure is a biphenyl system where the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and there are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions. Wait, but the key here is the symmetry. Biphenyls can have different conformations, but does this compound have a plane of symmetry? The substituents are on opposite sides? Wait, if the biphenyl is such that the substituents are in positions that create a chiral center or make the molecule chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't symmetric. Let me think: each ring has a carbonyl group (since it's a carboxylate) attached to a methyl ester. Wait, the structure is dimethyl, meaning that each carboxylic acid group is an ester, so OMe groups. So each carbonyl is connected to two methyl groups? Or each ring has a methyl ester. Hmm, but the main thing is the arrangement on the biphenyl. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule chiral, like if it's a trans configuration, then maybe it can have enantiomers. Alternatively, if the two rings are connected in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral. I'm not entirely sure, but I think in some biphenyl derivatives, even without a chiral center, the molecule can be chiral due to the arrangement of substituents. So maybe this molecule has optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: Let's see. The structure is a propanoate ester. The formula would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3, right? Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with a methyl ester. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be on the middle CH2. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait, the molecule would have a chiral center at the second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group). Because the carbon has four different groups: the two CH2 groups (but wait, wait. Carbon 2 is connected to -OH, a methyl (from the CH3CH2COO-), a carbonyl group, and a CH2- group. Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it.

The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)COOCH3, but that might not be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is three carbons. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to:

- The hydroxyl group (OH),
- Two CH2 groups (left and right),
- And the carbonyl group (COOCH3).

Wait, no. The structure would actually be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3, which would make the middle carbon have four different groups. Let me count: the central carbon is connected to:

- One methyl group (from CH3),
- One hydroxyl group,
- One carbonyl group (COOCH3),
- And one CH2 group (from the other side).

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl) is attached to:

- A methyl group (CH3),
- A hydroxyl (OH),
- A carbonyl group
