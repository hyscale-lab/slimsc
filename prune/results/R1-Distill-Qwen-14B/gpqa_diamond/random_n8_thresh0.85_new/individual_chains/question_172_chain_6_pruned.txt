Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures. Hmm, let me think. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, photosphere is where the light comes from, and LTE means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so the usual thermal physics applies.

I remember something about the excitation of atoms and temperature. Oh, the Boltzmann distribution! That's the one. The distribution of particles in different energy states depends on temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two states.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

Wait, the problem states that for star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So I think the ratio of excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2:1. Let me think, the excitation level is related to the population of higher energy states over lower ones. So the population ratio n_upper/n_lower is proportional to this excitation.

So for star_1, the ratio (n_upper/n_lower)_1 is twice that of star_2, which would be (n_upper/n_lower)_2. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But according to Boltzmann, the ratio is exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 higher than E1. The ratio n2/n1 is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). Because higher energy is less populated.

So for each star, (n_upper/n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference (E_upper - E_lower). So for star 1, this ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

The problem says that star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no. Because the question says that the excitation is twice as much. So the population in the excited state is higher. So the ratio (n_upper) for star_1 is higher than that for star_2. So the equation should be (n_upper)_1/(n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper)_2/(n_lower)_2.

So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, let me write this as:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take natural logs on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Hmm, let's rearrange terms. Let's move the terms involving ΔE to one side.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/(T2) -1/(T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Or wait, let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1: it's (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

ΔE (T1 - T2) = ln(2) * k T1 T2

I'm supposed to find the relation between T1 and T2. Let me rearrange this equation.

Hmm, but I'm not given specific values for ΔE or k, so perhaps I can express it as a ratio.

Wait, but looking at the options, they all involve ln(2) equals some function of T1 and T2. So how can I manipulate this equation?

Let me go back. The equation after taking logs was:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Let me rearrange:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] = ln(2)

Wait, 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

ln(2) = [ΔE (T1 - T2)] / [k T1 T2 ]

But wait, the question gives the energy difference, ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. But looking at the options, none of them have ΔE in them. So perhaps I'm missing something, but maybe that's not needed because in the options, the equation for T1 and T2 is given without the constants, so perhaps the equation is set in terms of this ΔE and k.

Wait, but for the purposes of the equation, I'm to find the correct form of the equation that relates T1 and T2. So the equation I have is:

ln(2) = [ (ΔE (T1 - T2) ) / (k T1 T2) ) ]

But this would mean that,

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / [ (k T1 T2)/ΔE ]

But I don't think that's the case because the options don't have variables like ΔE or k. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, another approach: let's take the ratio of the two Boltzmann factors. Let me write the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star 1 as n1 and for star 2 as n2. According to the problem, n1 = 2 * n2.

So,

n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural log:

-ΔE/(k
