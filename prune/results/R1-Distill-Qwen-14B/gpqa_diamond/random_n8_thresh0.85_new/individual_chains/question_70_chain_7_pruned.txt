Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what's going on here. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules, so I need to find out what E is first.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction given.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 8 equivalents suggest that maybe B is a diatomic molecule since 8 would mean each molecule of B provides two atoms. Wait, or maybe it's a ratio of the moles. So solid A plus 8 moles of B gives C. Common reactions with high equivalents often involve things like metal oxides. For example, maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas like Cl2 or O2. But 8 equivalents might be a red herring—I should think about the products.

Then, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is probably something like a gas, maybe a chloride or something explosive. Hmm.

Next, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong and weak acids... that suggests F could be like HCl (strong), and G could be something like H2SO3 (but wait, H2SO3 is a weak acid, but let me think). Alternatively, maybe F is H2SO4 and G is H3PO4? No, wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps F is HNO3 and G is H2CO3 or something else. But wait, when C reacts with water, it gives A and two acids. Let me think about what C could be.

Wait, C is a bright red product. Bright red in chemistry... think about things like MnO4- ions (which are purple), or maybe something like Fe(III) oxide? No, Fe(III) oxide is reddish, but not bright red. Oh wait, maybe it's a nitrate? Or perhaps it's a compound with a transition metal that gives a red color. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide, but sulfides are usually not so bright. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a compound of vanadium or chromium. Or maybe it's a compound that forms a red-colored solution, like cobalt complexes. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that is red, like iron(III) oxide (which is reddish), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reaction when C is hydrolyzed. It produces A and two acids. So C could be a salt that produces two different acids when it reacts with water. For example, suppose C is a sulfite or a nitrite. Wait, or perhaps C is a nitrate? No, wait, nitrates usually don't produce two acids upon hydrolysis. Let me think: perhaps C is a metal nitrate, but when it hydrolyzes, it would form a metal hydroxide and nitric acid. But that's only one acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonic acid? No, that's more for aromatic substitution. Another approach: since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, perhaps C is a salt of a weak acid and a strong acid. For example, if C is a sodium salt of a weak acid, but then the hydrolysis would produce the weak acid and a strong acid. Wait, but C is the product of A and B; perhaps in the first reaction, A is a metal reacting with B, which is a diatomic gas, like Cl2.

Wait, perhaps I should think about all the clues together. Let's list the reactions again.

1. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
2. C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
3. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. D + B → H (solvent), in 1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Let's think about D reacting with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D and B combine to make a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But B is a gas, and D is a gas. So the reaction is between two gases forming a liquid (solvent) H. So perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, which combine to form H2O (a solvent). But H2O is a solvent. Wait, but O2 plus H2 in H2O would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But in the problem, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So 1 mole of B and 1 mole of D → 1 mole of H. So the reaction would be B + D → H.

If H is a solvent, let's think of possible reactions. Another possibility is that B is Cl2 and D is NH3. Cl2 + NH3 → NH2Cl (but not a common solvent). Or perhaps B is CO2 and D is H2O? No, because then the ratio would be 1:1 to form something else. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is CH4 to make CO2 and H2O? No, that's not a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, another thought: D could be H2, and B is O2. 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. So the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But the ratio here is 2:1 (H2 to O2) to produce H2O. But the problem says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. So perhaps the reaction is B + D → H.

Wait, another possibility: B is CO2 and D is H2O. But that's a 1:1 ratio; they would form... but CO2 + H2O is just H2CO3, which is not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is CH4. But O2 + CH4 would need a catalyst or something to react, but I don't think that's a common solvent.

Hmm, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Cl2 + CH4 → CH2Cl2, but that's not a solvent. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is C (carbon). But O2 and C react to form CO or CO2. Hmm, not a solvent.

Wait, another angle: D is a gas, B is a gas; H is a solvent. So perhaps H is something like ethanol. But how? Wait, ethanol is CH3CH2OH. To make CH3CH2OH
