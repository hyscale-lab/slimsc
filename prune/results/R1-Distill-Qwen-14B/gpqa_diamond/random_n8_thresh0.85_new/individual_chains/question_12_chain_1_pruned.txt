Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a pion. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary, and we're given the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are for the kinetic energies of the products, I think.

Wait, so the pion is at rest, and it decays into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, but I guess in this problem, their mass is neglected. So the muon and neutrino are the products.

Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. But because the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy would be approximately equal to its momentum times c, but since we're working in MeV units, maybe the c factors cancel out.

So, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, because it's stationary.

Energy conservation: E_initial = E_mu + E_nu
Momentum conservation: p_mu = -p_nu, so their magnitudes are equal.

The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But for the neutrino, the rest mass is zero, so E_nu = p_nu * c. But since we're in units where c=1 (MeV and such, so maybe it's okay), E_nu = p_nu.

Wait, but the muon has rest mass, so its energy is sqrt(p_mu^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4). Again, since c is 1 in these units, E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2).

But wait, the neutrino's energy is just p_nu because m_nu is zero. So let's write the equations.

Total initial energy: E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p_nu. Also, since p_mu = p_nu, because the momenta are equal and opposite, so their magnitudes are the same. Let's denote p = p_mu = p_nu.

So substituting:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi

So we have sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p.

Now, square both sides:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right-hand side: m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.

So, solving for p:

p = (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) / (2 m_pi).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So m_pi squared is (139.6)^2 = let me calculate that.

139.6 * 139.6 = approximately, let's compute 140^2 is 19600, but subtract 0.4*(2*140) + 0.16. Wait, maybe better to just compute 139.6^2.

139.6 * 139.6:

Calculate 139 * 139 = (140 -1)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140 +1 = 19600 - 280 +1= 19321.

Now, the 0.6^2 is 0.36, and the cross terms: 2*(139)*(0.6) = 2*83.4= 166.8.

So 139.6^2 = (139 + 0.6)^2 = 139^2 + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19321 + 167.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

Similarly, m_mu^2 is 105.7^2. So 105^2 is 11025. 0.7^2 is 0.49, and 2*105*0.7=147. So, 105.7^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So now, m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then p = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6).

Compute the denominator: 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Let me approximate:

279.2 * 29 = approx 8096.8 (since 279.2 *30=8376, so 29 is 8376-279.2=8096.8). Hmm, 279.2 * 29.7 =?

Wait, 2
