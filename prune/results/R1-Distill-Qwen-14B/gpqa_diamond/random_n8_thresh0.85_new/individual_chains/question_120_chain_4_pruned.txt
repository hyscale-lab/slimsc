Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's try to think through this.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I recall is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, a larger parallax means the star is closer because the shift is more noticeable when the star is nearer.

The question says the stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their actual spatial density is constant throughout the volume. So, more volume would mean more stars, but each star occupies a point in space.

Wait, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, it's about the count of stars in a certain range of parallax values. Let me think in terms of distances. Since plx is 1/d, higher plx means closer distance. So, when plx increases, the distance decreases.

If we consider a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what is the corresponding distance range? Let's see. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, if I have a change in plx of dplx, how does that translate to change in distance, dd?

Let me compute dd in terms of dplx. d = 1/plx. So, dd/dplx = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. That would be -1/plx². So, dd = - (dplx) / (plx²). The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, which makes sense.

But wait, when plx increases, the distance decreases. So, a small dplx corresponds to a small dd. Now, the number of stars in a particular distance shell depends on the volume of that shell. For a spherical shell, the volume is 4πr² dr, where r is the radius (distance), and dr is the thickness of the shell.

But wait, in this case, the shell's thickness in terms of distance is dd, which is |d| from above. So, the number of stars N in a shell between r and r+dr would be proportional to the volume, which is 4π r² dr.

But since we're looking at parallax, we need to express everything in terms of plx. Remember that r = 1/plx. So, substituting, N ∝ 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But dd is (dplx)/(plx²). Wait, because from earlier, dd = -dplx/(plx²). So, the absolute value is dplx / plx².

So substituting back into N: N = K * (4π) * (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx²) ) = K * (4π) * (dplx) / plx^4.

Wait, that's for a small range of dplx. But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, N per unit dplx is N/dplx = K * 4π / plx^4.

But I think I might have missed a step here. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider how the number of stars in a given parallax range depends on plx.

Because the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a volume element dV is proportional to dV.

So, dN = n * dV, where n is the number density (stars per volume). Since it's uniform, n is constant.

Now, the volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4π r² dr. But I need to express this in terms of parallax, which is plx = 1/r.

So, r = 1/plx. Then, dr = - (dplx)/(plx²). Taking dr's magnitude, we get |dr| = dplx / plx².

Substituting into dV
