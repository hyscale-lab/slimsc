Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, right?

I remember that the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative population of two energy levels. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let's say E_upper is the higher energy level and E_lower is the lower one. So for star 1, the population in E_upper is twice that of star 2. Wait, wait. The problem says the atoms are twice as excited in star_1. So for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level?

Wait, I think I'm mixing up. Let me get this straight. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So for a particular energy level, the fraction of atoms in that level is higher in star_1. Or wait, maybe the population ratio is different.

Wait, no, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if I consider the specific energy level, the number of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So n1_upper / n2_upper = 2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, star_1 has twice as excited, so I think n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower). Or maybe it's the ratio between the excited state and the lower state.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it using the Boltzmann factor. Let's denote for star_1, the ratio of excited to lower states is R1 = n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, R2 = n2
