Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light propagating through a moving glass medium. Hmm, I need to find the speed of light in the glass as observed from the laboratory frame. Let me think about this step by step.

Wait, the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So, the glass is moving towards me, and the light is going in the same direction. The glass has an index of refraction n, and I'm supposed to find the speed relative to the lab.

I remember that when you have media moving relative to each other, you probably need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But wait, let me think. The speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? So in the glass's rest frame, the light would be moving at v_light = c/n.

But since the glass is moving, I need to find how this speed transforms into the lab frame. Oh, right, because the glass is moving, the lab observer will see the light moving with a different velocity.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u' + v)/(1 + (u'v)/c²), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame relative to the lab. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light's velocity in the glass's frame is v_light = c/n. So I should apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, let me get the setup right. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So if the lab is the rest frame, the glass is moving at v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass (towards the observer). So in the glass frame, light's speed is c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So, from the lab's perspective, what's the speed of the light? Using the relativistic addition formula: u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

Here, u' is c/n. So substituting:

u = [ (c/n) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ]

Simplify the denominator: (c v)/(n c²) ) = v/(n c). So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c).

Wait, let's compute it properly.

Denominator: 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c
