Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's think about what I know.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c, same direction. So, both are moving in the same direction but at different speeds.

Wait, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just subtract them normally. I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed. Oh right, because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, let me get that right. The relative velocity u' is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, I think that's if you're in the frame of one object and want to find the speed of the other. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be the difference between their speeds. But at relativistic speeds, it's not just 0.6c minus 0.5c. Because that would give 0.1c, but maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Oh right, the correct formula for the relative velocity u is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So plugging in v1 =0.6c and v2=0.5c. Let's calculate that.

So numerator is 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1-0.3=0.7. So denominator is 0.7. So u= (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So approximately 0.14c. Hmm, so that's the relative speed between them. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy for each astronaut and sum them. The relativistic energy E is given by gamma multiplied by m c squared. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut with mass 2m and velocity 0.6c: gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 is gamma * (2m) c². So yeah, 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut, mass 3m, velocity 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 *3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2 gives 2.5 +3.464 =5.964 m c². So about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, let's see what each says.

Option A: v_rel=1.1c, E=mc². No, our relative speed is about 0.14c, and the energy is much higher than mc².

Option B: v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96 mc². Wait, the relative speed we calculated is around 0.14c, not 0.1c. So B's speed is wrong.

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Oh, that matches exactly what I calculated.

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5 mc². So energy is 5, but our calculation was ~5.96, which is more than 5. So D is incorrect.

So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), velocity \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), velocity \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\), \(E = mc^2\). Incorrect, as the relative speed is \(0.14c\) and the total energy is much greater than \(mc^2\).
- **Option B:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96mc^2\). Incorrect, as the relative speed is \(0.14c\), not \(0.1c\).
- **Option C:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\). Correct, as both the relative speed and total energy match the calculations.
- **Option D:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5mc^2\). Incorrect, as the total energy is \(5.96mc^2\), not \(5mc^2\).

### Final Answer
**Answer: C**
