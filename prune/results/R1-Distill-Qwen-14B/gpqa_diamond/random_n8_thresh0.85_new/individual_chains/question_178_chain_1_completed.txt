Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the Lagrangian L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant determines whether the interaction is renormalizable. If the dimension is positive or zero, the theory might be renormalizable. Negative dimensions usually mean it's not. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact criteria. Let me think.

Renormalizability depends on the interaction terms having coupling constants with mass dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of the fields' dimensions in each term). Or wait, more accurately, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Because the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 (since the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over 4 dimensions).

So each term in L must have dimension 4.

Looking at the given term, L_int is a part of the Lagrangian. So let's find the dimension of each part.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

I need to find the mass dimensions of each component.

I think the fields have the following dimensions:

- Fermion fields ψ: For a Dirac spinor, the dimension is 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, the action is dimensionless, so the Lagrangian has dimension 4. The kinetic term is ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. Let's see: ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ∂_μ is dimension 1 (since derivative is like momentum, which is mass). So ψ̄ (3/2) * ∂_μ (1) * ψ (3/2) → 3/2 +1 +3/2 = 4. So yes, each ψ is dimension 3/2.

- F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism. It's made from the derivatives of the gauge field A. The field A has dimension 1 (since it's like a vector potential, and Maxwell's term is F^2 which has dimension 4; F itself would be dimension 2? Let me confirm. Maxwell's Lagrangian is F^μν F_{μν}, which has dimension 4. Each F has dimension 2 because 2 + 2 =4. Since F is made from derivatives of A, which each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so F is dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Because gamma matrices are just matrices, their dimension is zero. The structure σ_{μν} is [γ_mu, γ_nu] multiplied by i/2, so it's a dimensionless object.

So let's break down the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ̄ and ψ is 3/2. σ is dimensionless. F is dimension 2.

So the product is (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the whole term without κ has dimension 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, so κ must make up the difference. So the dimension of κ is 4 -5 = -1.

Wait, mass dimension of the term is 5, so κ must have dimension [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. Because when you multiply κ by the term, the entire term must have dimension 4. So, yes, κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, renormalizability. The mass dimension of the coupling constant determines this. If [κ]_M ≥ 0, the theory is renormalizable. If it's negative, it's not. Because in terms of perturbative renormalizability, each coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (UV divergence), making the theory non-renormalizable, requiring an infinite number of counterterms.

Wait, but I think the condition is that the coupling must have mass dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of the fields' dimensions) in each term. But in this case, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Alternatively, the coupling's dimension is calculated as [κ] = 4 - [sum of the other fields].

Wait, another approach: The term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So our term is κ * (ψ̄ σ F ψ) → let's compute the dim of ψ̄ σ F ψ.

ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. σ is dimensionless. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 +2 =5. So the term without κ has dimension 5. So κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1.

So [κ]_M = -1.

Now, for renormalizability, I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if the dimension is negative, the coupling becomes stronger at high energies (UV), leading to non-renormalizable theories. Because that implies that the interaction is relevant in the IR but irrelevant in the UV, but wait, wait, actually it's the opposite. Wait, relevant operators are those with positive mass dimension; they become more important at lower energies (IR). Irrelevant operators have negative mass dimension and become important at high energies (UV), which is where perturbation theory breaks down.

So for a theory to be renormalizable, all the couplings must have dimension ≤4, but more precisely, their dimension must be ≥ 0 and ≤4. Wait, no, I think that the condition is that the couplings must have dimension ≤4. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So any term with higher dimension would require higher-order terms, but that's not the issue here.

Wait, more accurately: A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimension ≥0. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, each vertex in Feynman diagrams would bring in a factor of (Λ/[μ])^n, where Λ is a high-energy scale, leading to the theory becoming non-predictive as Λ increases, hence non-renormalizable.

So for this term, κ has dimension -1. That's negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Putting it together: κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options, option C says [κ]_M =-1 and theory not renormalizable. Option C is the correct one.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $3/2$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor is a commutator of dimensionless gamma matrices, so it is dimensionless.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$
The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has the following mass dimension:
- $\bar{\psi}$ contributes $3/2$.
- $\psi$ contributes $3/2$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes $2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

Adding these contributions:
\[
\text{Mass dimension of the term} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

### Step 3: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have a total mass dimension of $4$ in four spacetime dimensions. Since the term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has a mass dimension of $5$, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must compensate to ensure the entire term has a mass dimension of $4$. Thus:
\[
[\kappa]_M = 4 - 5 = -1.
\]

### Step 4: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have mass dimensions $\geq 0$. In this case, the coupling constant $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction becomes stronger at high energies (UV regime), making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. Therefore, the correct answer is:
