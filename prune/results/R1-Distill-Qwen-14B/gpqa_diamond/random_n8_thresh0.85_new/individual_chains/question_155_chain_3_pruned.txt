Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so I think that means the eigenstates of P_z are our basis. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. They also give the explicit state vector as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So my task is to compute the uncertainty of P_z in this state.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty ΔA for an operator A in a state |ψ⟩ is calculated as the square root of the expectation value of A squared minus the square of the expectation value of A. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩² ). Right, that formula.

First, let me write down the state vector. The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, no, the elements are in a column. So it's a column vector with three components: first is -1/2, second is 1/√2, third is -1/2.

Now I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for this state.

The matrix for P_z is given as:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, since the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, the matrix is diagonal in this basis, which makes things easier.

Now, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can just take the inner product of |ψ⟩ with P_z |ψ⟩. Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of each component squared times the corresponding diagonal element.

Let me calculate that.

The state |ψ⟩ has components a, b, c, where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c =
