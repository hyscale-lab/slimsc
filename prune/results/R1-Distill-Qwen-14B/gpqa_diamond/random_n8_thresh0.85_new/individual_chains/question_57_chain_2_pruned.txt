Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta. The phase shifts provided are delta_0 = 90 degrees, delta_1=67, delta_2=55, delta_3=30, and delta_4=13 degrees. They ask for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) is given in terms of phase shifts. Since the scattering is elastic, we can use partial waves. The general form is f(θ,φ) = sum over l of ( (2l+1)/4π ) * e^{iδ_l} ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) * P_l^0(cosθ) * e^{i l φ} }, where P_l^0 is the Legendre polynomial.

But wait, the problem specifies the incident beam direction. In that case, θ would be 0 degrees because the scattering is along the beam direction, right? So θ=0, which means cosθ = 1, so P_l^0(1) is 1 for all l. Also, φ=0, so the e^{i l φ} term becomes 1.

So the amplitude simplifies to f(0,0) = sum from l=0 to ... of ( (2l+1)/4π ) * e^{i δ_l} ( e^{2i δ_l} - 1 )

Wait, wait, no. Let me get the expression right. The general formula is f(θ,φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) ) * P_l(cosθ) ), but I'm not sure if I remember that correctly. Hmm, perhaps it's better to look up the exact expression. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I think I should proceed.

Wait, another approach: For scattering along the direction of the incident beam, θ=0. So the scattering amplitude f(0,0) is given by the sum over l of ( (2l+1)/4π ) * (e^{i δ_l} ( e^{2i δ_l} - 1 )) * P_l(1) * e^{i l φ} ), but because φ is zero (incident direction), and P_l(1) is 1 for all l.

Wait, but wait a minute, I think the general expression is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l + 1) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) e^{iδ_l} ] P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} }, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (e^{i δ_l} [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ]) multiplied by the Legendre polynomial and other terms.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_l (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} - 1 )) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} }.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the partial wave expansion. The amplitude f can be written as f = sum_{l=0}^∞ f_l, where each f_l is (2l + 1)/(4π) e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ}.

Wait, but the problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction, which is θ=0, φ=0. So the amplitude f(0,0) would be sum over l of [ (2l+1)/(4π) * e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) * 1 * 1 ].

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's break it down. The amplitude f has a real and imaginary part. The imaginary part would be Im[f] = sum [ (2l+1)/(4π) * Im[ e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) ] ].

So each term in the sum is (2l+1)/(4π) multiplied by the imaginary part of e^{i δ_l} (e^{2i δ_l} - 1).

Hmm, let's compute e^{i δ} (e^{2i δ} - 1) for each l.

Wait, e^{i δ} multiplied by (e^{2i δ} -1) is e^{i δ} * e^{2i δ} - e^{i δ} = e^{3i δ} - e^{i δ}.

So the expression becomes (e^{3
