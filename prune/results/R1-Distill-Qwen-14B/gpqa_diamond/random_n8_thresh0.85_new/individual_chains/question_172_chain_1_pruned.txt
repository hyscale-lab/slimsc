Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that the distribution of energy levels in atoms is described by the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state relative to the thermal energy.

So the Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me get the exact formula. Oh right, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where E_i and E_j are the energies of the states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So I think that means the population of that energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, for star_1, n1 is twice n2. Or wait, wait. Wait, actually, the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think it's that the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2's. So n1 = 2 n2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The specific energy level is the same for both stars, right? So for each star, the number of atoms in that energy level is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, the ratio (n_i)/(n_j) is 2, where n_i is the number in the excited level and n_j is the ground level? Or wait, maybe not. Or perhaps each star has its own ratio, but we compare the two stars.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure it. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. So Î”E = E_i - E_j = 1.38e
