Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can get tricky. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. They give four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence correctly leads to the target molecule.

Let me first break down the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1,2,3. Wait, no, waitâ€”the numbering must be such that the substituents are in certain positions. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me visualize that: the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Or wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering depends on the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about the order of substitution. Wait, maybe it's better to think about the directing effects of each group.

Each substitution will direct new groups into certain positions based on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's an ortho/para or meta director.

So let's think about the substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (-OEt): This is an activating group because it's an electron-donating ether. It's an ortho/para director.

2. tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3): This is a bulky, strongly activating (alkyl group) and is also an ortho/para director. Because it's bulky, steric effects might influence where the next substituent adds.

3. Nitro group (-NO2): This is a strong deactivating (electron-withdrawing) group and is a meta director.

Wait, but when multiple substituents are present, the directing can get more complicated. The most powerful directing group takes precedence.

So the target molecule has three substituents. The order in which they are added will influence their positions.

But let's see, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are:

- Position 1: ethoxy

- Position 2: tert-butyl

- Position 3: nitro

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so the numbering might be such that the substituents are adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, which are adjacent. So, the three substituent groups are next to each other.

But wait, perhaps that's not possible due to steric hindrance. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 4 positions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and
