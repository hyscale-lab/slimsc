Okay, so I've got this question about a genetics and molecular biology experiment, and I need to figure out what's going wrong. Let's break it down step by step.

The question describes a scenario where a new ligand-receptor pair is studied in neural crest cells. The experiment involves creating a bicistronic vector with specific constructs, then testing expression in cells and mice. The main issue is that when they look under a confocal microscope, they don't see a green signal. The green signal is from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So the problem is that the eGFP isn't showing up, which suggests the receptor isn't being expressed correctly or the eGFP isn't being tagged properly.

First, let me understand the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (ligand and receptor). The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor is probably expressed as a separate mRNA but in the same transcript.

Looking at the vector structure:
- Ligand ORF is first, with a stop in a loxP cassette, then mCherry.
- Receptor ORF is after the IRES, has a stop in a lox2272 cassette, then eGFP.

They used Cre to excise the stop cassettes. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So, when Cre is present, it will remove the loxP-stop-loxP, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the lox2272 site should also be excised, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed.

Wait, but wait. The vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So maybe the Cre is under a constitutive promoter, and once introduced, it would recombine the lox sites. Alternatively, the Cre could be provided via another means, like the SOX10-Cre mice.

In the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. Then, they bred mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed these to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the Cre is probably being provided by the SOX10-Cre mice, which is a transgenic line that expresses Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, active in neural crest cells and their derivatives.

So, the idea is that the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP. Then, when they look for eGFP in the offspring, they expect to see green from the receptor-eGFP fusion. But they don't see it.

Let's look at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells. The eGFP is on the receptor, so it should be expressed in the same cells as the receptor. If the ligand is secreted, maybe, but the Western blot suggests expression. Wait, but the Western blot is done on total proteins, and they see a signal proportional to actin. So the proteins are being expressed. But the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. If the ligand and receptor are expressed, then why no eGFP?

But the question says that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. So, if the ligand and receptor were expressed, you'd expect the Western blot to show the bands. But the problem is that in the mice, the eGFP isn't visualized. So the issue is with the expression in the mouse model, not the initial cell culture.

Wait, the plasmid was transfected into primary astrocyte culture, which I think is for testing expression, but the main experiment is done in the mice. So in the mice, the construct is in the genome, and they crossed to SOX10-Cre mice, which should induce Cre in neural crest-derived cells (like astrocytes, perhaps). So the Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression.

But why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So the eGFP wouldn't be on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm, but stuck. However, eGFP is often used as a marker for expression regardless of where it is, as long as it's expressed. But if it's stuck in the Golgi, perhaps it's not properly trafficked. But the eGFP is fused to the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. So the receptor would go to the cell membrane, and eGFP should come along. If the construct is stuck, perhaps it's not properly processed. But why would that happen? Maybe due to a stop codon or frame shift.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, constitutive. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which should allow expression without needing a promoter, as IRES elements drive translation without necessarily requiring a promoter. So the enhancer might not be a problem for the receptor. But if the ligand's promoter is missing, then the ligand wouldn't be expressed. But the question is about the receptor-eGFP not being expressed, so maybe C is about the receptor expression. Hmm, but the CBA promoter is just for the ligand. The receptor's expression is via the IRES, which is part of the same transcript as the ligand. So maybe if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed. Wait, but the IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. So in the vector, after the ligand ORF comes the IRES, then the receptor ORF. So the IRES should allow for the translation of the receptor as a separate protein.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the first ORF (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, and the second (receptor) is after the IRES. So the CBA promoter drives the expression of the first ORF (ligand), and the IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF (receptor). So if the IRES isn't functional
