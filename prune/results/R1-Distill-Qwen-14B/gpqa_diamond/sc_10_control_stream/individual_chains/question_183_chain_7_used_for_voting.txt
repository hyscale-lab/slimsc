Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a way to determine how many rings and double bonds are in a molecule. Each degree can be a ring or a double bond, or a triple bond (which counts as two).

First, I think I should figure out what the starting material looks like. The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure in my mind.

Cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The numbering would be such that the carboxylic acid group is at position 3? Wait, no. Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Then, the carboxylic acid group is on carbon 2, right? Because it's 3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, no, I think the numbering starts such that the double bond's position is as low as possible. So if the cyclohexene is 3-ene, that's the main ring structure. Then the substituents: the formyl group is at position 2, and the vinyl group at position 5. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the structure. Okay, cyclohexane ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's 3-ene). Then, on C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and on C5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2 or CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring). So the ring would have at C2 the CHO, C3 and C4 double bond, and C5 has the vinyl group.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2, 5, and 3-ene. Then, there's a carboxylic acid group attached as well. Wait, wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh! So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps? Because in carboxylic acids, the -COOH group is at the end. So the ring is numbered such that the COOH is at position 1. So the structure would be: position 1: COOH, position 2: CHO, position 3: double bond starts (so position 3 and 4 are double bonded), position 5: vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring carbon.

Wait, no, the vinyl group is attached to the ring as CH2CH2, but I think it's actually CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the ring has the COOH at position 1, a double bond from 3 to 4, a formyl (CHO) group at position 2, and a vinyl group (CH2CH2) at position 5. Or wait, perhaps the substituents are attached to the ring carbons. So the structure would have a ring with COOH on C1, a double bond between C3 and C4, a formyl group on C2, and a vinyl group (CH2CH2) on C5.

But that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to think about the reaction first. The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait no, that's H2O. Or wait, maybe it's more about the dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. Alternatively, red phosphorus is often used in the presence of iodine for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, more commonly, red phosphorus is used with iodine for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's not it either. Wait, perhaps this is a situation where the reagent is used for the elimination of halides or for some kind of substitution.

Wait, another thought: when HI is used with red phosphorus, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps it's the Cleve elimination, but I don't remember the exact details. Alternatively, maybe it's the reaction of an acid derivative. Wait, the starting material has a formyl group and a vinyl group as substituents on the cyclohexene ring. Maybe the reaction is about the formyl group.

Wait, the starting compound is a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group, a formyl group, and a vinyl substituent. When it's treated with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the formyl group undergoes some reaction. I remember that formyl groups (CHO) can be reduced. For example, in the presence of H2 and a catalyst, the formyl group becomes CH2OH. But red phosphorus and HI? Hmm.

Wait, I think that when a carbonyl group (like formyl) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reduction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where the carbonyl is converted into a CH2I group. Wait, no, that might be with something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the elimination of the formyl group. Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the reagents again. Red phosphorus in HI is used for the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides, but that's for forming alkenes. Or maybe it's for the formation of the ylide in the Wittig reaction, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another angle: the starting material has a cyclohexene ring, so it already has one double bond. Then, the formyl group is a carbonyl, which is another double bond. The vinyl group is another double bond. So the starting material's structure has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring, the formyl group, and the vinyl group. Wait, that's three double bonds, so the degree of unsaturation is three. But wait, the cyclohexene ring is one double bond. The formyl group is C=O, another double bond. The vinyl group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond. So that's three double bonds. So the starting molecule has three degrees of unsaturation from the double bonds, plus the ring, but wait, wait, the ring itself is a type of unsaturation. Wait no, the ring is a ring (so one degree), and the double bonds add more. Let me think: each ring or double bond is a degree of unsaturation. So, in the starting molecule:

- Cyclohexene ring: one double bond (so one degree).
- Formyl group: C=O (another degree).
- Vinyl group: another double bond (third degree).
So the starting material has three degrees of unsaturation, right?

Wait, but the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI. So what happens in that reaction?

Another thought: perhaps the reaction converts the formyl group into something else. For example, formyl groups can undergo reduction. If the formyl group (CHO) is reduced, what would it become? With HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a halogenation or some addition.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction of a formyl group with HI and red phosphorus. I think that under certain conditions, the formyl group can be converted into a CH2I group. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is attacked by HI, leading to some substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a Wittig reaction. In the Wittig reaction, a ylide (generated from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide) reacts with a carbonyl group to form an alkene. But in this case, we're using red phosphorus and HI. I'm not certain, but maybe the formyl group is being converted into an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is being reduced. Wait, typically, the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH (using H2 and a catalyst), or to CH2O−NaOH, etc. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Maybe it's a different kind of reduction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formyl group is undergoing a reaction to form an imine or something else. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is undergoing a substitution. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see any halides in the starting material.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency. So perhaps after the reaction, some double bonds are formed or some rings are opened.

Wait, another angle: when HI is used with red phosphorus, perhaps it's a way to add iodide to a double bond or to cleave it. Oh! Wait, I think in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can add across double bonds. For example, in the addition of HI to alkenes, it can do a halohydrin formation or just add as HI. But with red phosphorus, perhaps it's a way to induce a certain addition.

Alternatively, I've heard of the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce ketones to alkanes. But that's with HCl, not HI. Wait, but wait: the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones (C=O) to CH2 groups using HCl and Zn(Hg). But here, the reagent is HI and red phosphorus. Maybe a similar reduction is happening.

Wait, here's a thought: perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is being reduced to CH2I. How? Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI could generate a phosphorus ylide, which could attack the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the HI is acting as a nucleophile. So, for a formyl group, perhaps the reaction would add HI across the carbonyl, forming something like CH2I-O-... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into a CH2 group. Wait, but with HI and red phosphorus. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each substituent's reaction.

The starting molecule has:

- A cyclohexene ring (double bond).
- A formyl group (CHO).
- A vinyl group (CH2=CH-).
- A carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

So after the reaction, what would happen to each of these groups?

Carboxylic acid: under what conditions does it react with HI and red phosphorus? I don't remember any typical reactions of carboxylic acids with these reagents. Maybe it's inert under these conditions. So the -COOH might remain unchanged.

The vinyl group is a double bond. If HI adds to it, perhaps it would become a diiodide. But if the reaction conditions favor addition, then the vinyl group would become CH2-I, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI in some way.

Wait, but when alkenes react with HI, it's typically an addition reaction. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI to form CH2-I-CH2-I? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, in HI addition to a double bond, each H and I would add across the double bond. So CH2=CH-R would become CH2I-CH2-R with HI. But wait, that's for a single addition. Wait, no, in the case of excess HI, perhaps more than one addition could happen, but alkenes usually only add once. So the vinyl group would become a CH2I group.

Wait, but the starting vinyl is attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the original structure would have a double bond as part of the vinyl group. If that adds HI, the double bond becomes a single bond with I atoms attached. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2I-CH2- attached to the ring. But wait, that would convert the double bond (vinyl) into a single bond, so that's a decrease in the index of hydrogen deficiency.

Similarly, the formyl group (CHO) might also react. If the formyl is converted into CH2I, that would change the structure.

Wait, so let's think about each group:

- Cyclohexene ring: double bond → if it reacts, it might become a single bond (so index decreases by 1).
- Formyl (CHO): converted into something else.
- Vinyl (CH2=CH-): converted into CH2I-CH2- (so double bond becomes single, index decreases by 1).

Now, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is probably inert under these conditions, so it remains the same.

So, the starting material has three double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl) → 3 degrees of unsaturation.

If after reaction:

- The ring's double bond is gone (converted to single bond?), so that's minus 1.
- The vinyl double bond is gone, minus another 1.
- The formyl group's double bond (C=O) is also converted, perhaps to a single bond.

Wait, what's the product of the formyl group when reacted with HI and red phosphorus?

I think that when a carbonyl group (like formyl) reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo a reduction to form a CH2I group. Let me think: the formyl group (CHO) is attacked by HI, perhaps leading to the formation of CH2I. So the C=O becomes CH2I, which is a single bond. So that's another decrease in the index of hydrogen deficiency.

So, if all three double bonds are eliminated (ring, formyl, vinyl), how does that affect the index?

Wait, the initial index is 3. If all three double bonds are gone, the index would be zero. But wait, the ring itself is a double bond equivalent. So when the ring's double bond is opened, that would change things.

Wait, no. The ring is a cyclohexene, which has one double bond (i.e., one ring and one double bond: but in a cyclohexene, the ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so the degree of unsaturation is 1 (the ring) plus 1 (the double bond) = 2. Wait, no, the cyclohexene has one double bond in the ring. So the ring itself is a six-membered ring, which is one degree (since a ring is one degree). The double bond in the ring is another degree, so the cyclohexene has two degrees of unsaturation in the ring itself.

But wait, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as (number of rings + number of double bonds + number of triple bonds × 2). So, for the starting molecule:

- The cyclohexene ring: 1 ring, 1 double bond → that's 2 degrees.
- The formyl group: 1 double bond → +1.
- The vinyl group: 1 double bond → +1.
So total degrees: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought earlier that the ring's double bond plus the ring's ring counts as two degrees. So the starting material would have 4 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, let's calculate this properly. The formula for calculating the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) is:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is hydrogen, X is halogens, N is nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate it for the starting material to make sure.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think back to the reaction. The product would have the ring's double bond (cyclohexene) converted, the formyl group converted, and the vinyl group converted.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure.

After the reaction:

The cyclohexene ring's double bond is still there? Or is it opened? Because the reagents are HI and red phosphorus, which might cause addition reactions on double bonds.

Wait, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond within the ring). If HI adds to this double bond, it would break the ring. But that would require the ring to open, which would decrease the number of rings and could form a diol or similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reagents don't affect the ring's double bond but only the other double bonds (formyl and vinyl). So the ring remains as a cyclohexene, but the formyl and vinyl double bonds are converted.

Wait, if the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I, that would eliminate the C=O double bond. Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would add HI, becoming CH2I-CH2-. So, both of their double bonds are gone. The ring's double bond remains. So the product would have the ring's double bond (1 degree), and maybe other substituents.

So, the product's DoU would be 1 (from the ring), plus any new double bonds formed.

Wait, what about the reaction of the formyl group? If the formyl group is reduced to CH2OH, that would eliminate the C=O double bond. But if it's converted to CH2I, that would also eliminate the double bond. So in either case, the formyl group's DoU is lost.

Similarly, the vinyl group's DoU is lost when it reacts with HI.

So, the starting material had four degrees (assuming the ring is two and the others are two), but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has three degrees of unsaturation. Let me recalculate:

Starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Structure:

- Cyclohexene ring (6-membered) with a double bond (so one ring, one double bond → 2 degrees).
- Formyl group (CHO): one double bond → +1.
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-): another double bond → +1.
So total degrees: 2 + 1 +1 =4.

So starting material has four degrees.

After reaction:

If the formyl group is converted to CH2I (losing a double bond), vinyl group is converted to CH2I (losing another), and the ring's double bond may or may not remain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond. So in the product, the ring's double bond is still there (so DoU=1), and the other substituents no longer have double bonds.

So, the product's DoU is 1.

Because:

- The ring has one double bond → 1 DoU.
- The formyl and vinyl groups' double bonds are gone.

Wait, but the starting material had a carboxylic acid. Does that contribute to DoU? The -COOH group has a double bond (C=O), so that's another DoU.

Wait, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. The carboxylic acid group (COOH) has a double bond in the C=O. So the starting material has:

- Cyclohexene ring: 2 DoU (1 ring, 1 double bond)
- Formyl group: 1 DoU
- Vinyl group: 1 DoU
- Carboxylic acid: 1 DoU (C=O)
So total DoU is 2 +1 +1 +1 =5.

Wait, that's a big number. But I might have overcounted. Let me think again. Wait, no, the cyclohexene ring includes a double bond, but the carboxylic acid is a substituent on the ring. So the ring is part of the molecule, and the substituents are additional groups.

Wait, but the formula for DoU is based on the entire molecule. So let's calculate it properly.

Let me try to determine the formula for the starting material. Let's count the number of carbons. The cyclohexene is C6H8 (since cyclohexene is C6H10-2= C6H8? Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. Cyclohexene, with one double bond, would have C6H10. So, structure: cyclohexene ring (C6H10) plus substituents.

Wait, the substituents are:

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO) → adds one C, one O.
- At position 5: vinyl group (CH2CH2?), but that's likely CH2=CH2 attached as a substituent → adds two C's and a double bond.
- At position 1: carboxylic acid (COOH) → adds two O's, but for the purpose of formula, it adds -COOH, which is a functional group.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the molecular formula of the starting material.

The base is cyclohexene: C6H10.

Each substituent adds:

- At position 2: formyl (CHO) → which is OCHO? Wait, no, the formyl is CHO, which adds one C and one O, but also replaces a hydrogen on the ring. So the formula would be C6H10 → adding CHO (C1H O1) → C7H11O.

Wait, no. Let's think about the substituents:

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the parent chain is the cyclohexene ring.

Breaking it down:

The formula would be:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) → but with substituents:

- At position 2: CHO (which is C=O-H, so substituent is CHO, so adds one C, one O, and two H's (since it's a substituent replacing a H on the ring).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each substituent adds to the ring's formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is better determined as:

The parent is cyclohexene: C6H10.

But with substituents:

- 2-formyl: formyl is CHO, which adds one C, one O, and the formula adjustment.
- 5-vinyl: vinyl is CH2=CH-, so adds two C's, one H, and a double bond.
- 3-enecarboxylic acid: so a COOH group at position 3. Wait, no, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the COOH is at position 1, and the double bond is at position 3.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Adding:

- formyl (CHO) → adds 1 C, 1 O.
- vinyl (CH2=CH-) → adds 2 C's, 3 H's (since CH2=CH- has two CH2 groups, but wait, CH2=CH- has 3 H's on the double bond. Hmm, maybe I should just count the substituent as a vinyl group, which is CH2CH2 with a double bond. So as a substituent, it's CH2CH2 where one of the CH2 is attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just think of the formula as:

The molecule has:

- 6 carbons in the ring.
- 1 formyl (CHO) → adds 1 C.
- 1 vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → adds 2 C's.
- 1 carboxylic acid group (COOH) → adds 2 O's but 1 C (since COOH is O2, but the C is already in the ring? No, wait, COOH is -COOH, which is O2, but the C is part of the ring. So the ring has a COOH substituent, which adds O's but no C's.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write the molecular formula as:

Each substituent adds:

- Formyl: 1 C, 1 O.
- Vinyl: 2 C's, 1 O (if any? No, vinyl is just CH2=CH-. So no O's added.
- Carboxylic acid: 2 O's, but C is already part of the ring.

So the total carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C's.

Hydrogens: Let's see, cyclohexene is C6H10. Each substituent replaces a H.

Formyl (CHO) adds 1 H (since O is double bonded to C). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: the ring is C6H10. Each substitution replaces a H.

So, for each substituent:

- Formyl: replaces a H → so H count goes from 10 to 9.
- Vinyl: replaces a H → now 8.
- Carboxylic acid: replaces a H → 7.

But wait, the substituents may add more H's. For example, the formyl group is CHO, which has H attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the CHO group is attached as R-CHO, which adds one H (the H from CHO is part of the substituent).

But in the parent cyclohexene, each substituent replaces a H, but may add more H's based on their structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the molecular formula as:

Each substituent adds a certain number of H's.

Formyl (CHO) → -CHO has one H (the aldehyde H).
Vinyl (CH2=CH-) → the substituent is CH2-CH2 (but with a double bond, so perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, which would be CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent adds two H's: the CH2=CH- group has two H's on the CH2 group (attached to the ring) and two H's on the CH group across the double bond. Or perhaps each substituent adds more H's, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the DoU using the molecular formula. Let's assume the starting material has the formula C9H10O3 (just a guess). If the starting material has nine C's, then:

DoU = (2*9 +2 - H - X + N)/2.

But without knowing the exact formula, this approach is tricky.

Maybe I should move on and think about the product. If the formyl group is converted to CH2I, the vinyl group is converted to CH2I-CH2- (or similar), and the cyclohexene ring remains, then the product's structure would be:

Cyclohexene ring (with one double bond → 1 DoU) plus substituents that don't have double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps both the formyl and vinyl groups' double bonds are eliminated, and the cyclohexene's double bond remains. So the product has one DoU from the ring.

Wait, but what if the reaction also opens the ring's double bond? For example, if HI adds across the cyclohexene's double bond, the ring would open, converting the ring into a chain with two iodine substituents. But that would change the structure significantly and reduce the DoU.

But I'm not sure whether the reagents would react with the ring's double bond or just the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only affects the substituents, leaving the ring's double bond intact.

In that case, the product would have the ring's double bond (1 DoU) and no other double bonds from substituents. So the DoU would be 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the ring's double bond is also converted, making the product completely saturated, leading to a DoU of 0. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's reconsider the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hittig reaction, which is a method to prepare alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the formyl group.

Wait, another angle: when a carbonyl group (like formyl) reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it undergoes a substitution to form a CH2I group. So the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2I. This would eliminate the C=O double bond, decreasing the DoU by 1.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI to become CH2I-CH2-, which would eliminate its double bond, decreasing DoU by another 1.

The cyclohexene's double bond remains, so DoU is 1.

So the product's DoU would be 1.

The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

So the answer would be A)1.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a way to determine how many rings and double bonds are in a molecule. Each degree can be a ring or a double bond, or a triple bond (which counts as two).

First, I think I should figure out what the starting material looks like. The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure in my mind.

Cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The numbering would be such that the carboxylic acid group is at position 3? Wait, no. Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Then, the carboxylic acid group is on carbon 2, right? Because it's 3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, no, I think the numbering starts such that the double bond's position is as low as possible. So if the cyclohexene is 3-ene, that's the main ring structure. Then the substituents: the formyl group is at position 2, and the vinyl group at position 5. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to imagine the structure. Okay, cyclohexane ring with a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's 3-ene). Then, on C2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and on C5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2 or CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring). So the ring would have at C2 the CHO, C3 and C4 double bond, and C5 has the vinyl group.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2, 5, and 3-ene. Then, there's a carboxylic acid group attached as well. Wait, wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh! So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, perhaps? Because in carboxylic acids, the -COOH group is at the end. So the ring is numbered such that the COOH is at position 1. So the structure would be: position 1: COOH, position 2: CHO, position 3: double bond starts (so position 3 and 4 are double bonded), position 5: vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring carbon.

Wait, no, the vinyl group is attached to the ring as CH2CH2, but I think it's actually CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the ring has the COOH at position 1, a double bond from 3 to 4, a formyl (CHO) group at position 2, and a vinyl group (CH2CH2) at position 5. Or wait, perhaps the substituents are attached to the ring carbons. So the structure would have a ring with COOH on C1, a double bond between C3 and C4, a formyl group on C2, and a vinyl group (CH2CH2) on C5.

But that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to think about the reaction first. The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait no, that's H2O. Or wait, maybe it's more about the dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. Alternatively, red phosphorus is often used in the presence of iodine for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, more commonly, red phosphorus is used with iodine for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's not it either. Wait, perhaps this is a situation where the reagent is used for the elimination of halides or for some kind of substitution.

Wait, another thought: when HI is used with red phosphorus, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps it's the Cleve elimination, but I don't remember the exact details. Alternatively, maybe it's the reaction of an acid derivative. Wait, the starting material has a formyl group and a vinyl group as substituents on the cyclohexene ring. Maybe the reaction is about the formyl group.

Wait, the starting compound is a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group, a formyl group, and a vinyl substituent. When it's treated with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the formyl group undergoes some reaction. I remember that formyl groups (CHO) can be reduced. For example, in the presence of H2 and a catalyst, the formyl group becomes CH2OH. But red phosphorus and HI? Hmm.

Wait, I think that when a carbonyl group (like formyl) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reduction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction where the carbonyl is converted into a CH2I group. Wait, no, that might be with something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrolysis, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the elimination of the formyl group. Wait, I'm not making progress here. Maybe I should think about the reagents again. Red phosphorus in HI is used for the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides, but that's for forming alkenes. Or maybe it's for the formation of the ylide in the Wittig reaction, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another angle: the starting material has a cyclohexene ring, so it already has one double bond. Then, the formyl group is a carbonyl, which is another double bond. The vinyl group is another double bond. So the starting material's structure has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring, the formyl group, and the vinyl group. Wait, that's three double bonds, so the degree of unsaturation is three. But wait, the cyclohexene ring is one double bond. The formyl group is C=O, another double bond. The vinyl group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond. So that's three double bonds. So the starting molecule has three degrees of unsaturation from the double bonds, plus the ring, but wait, wait, the ring itself is a type of unsaturation. Wait no, the ring is a ring (so one degree), and the double bonds add more. Let me think: each ring or double bond is a degree of unsaturation. So, in the starting molecule:

- Cyclohexene ring: one double bond (so one degree).
- Formyl group: C=O (another degree).
- Vinyl group: another double bond (third degree).
So the starting material has three degrees of unsaturation, right?

Wait, but the question is about the product after reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI. So what happens in that reaction?

Another thought: perhaps the reaction converts the formyl group into something else. For example, formyl groups can undergo reduction. If the formyl group (CHO) is reduced, what would it become? With HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a halogenation or some addition.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction of a formyl group with HI and red phosphorus. I think that under certain conditions, the formyl group can be converted into a CH2I group. Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl is attacked by HI, leading to some substitution.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a Wittig reaction. In the Wittig reaction, a ylide (generated from triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide) reacts with a carbonyl group to form an alkene. But in this case, we're using red phosphorus and HI. I'm not certain, but maybe the formyl group is being converted into an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is being reduced. Wait, typically, the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH (using H2 and a catalyst), or to CH2O−NaOH, etc. But in this case, the reagents are red phosphorus and HI. Maybe it's a different kind of reduction.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formyl group is undergoing a reaction to form an imine or something else. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is undergoing a substitution. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see any halides in the starting material.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency. So perhaps after the reaction, some double bonds are formed or some rings are opened.

Wait, another angle: when HI is used with red phosphorus, perhaps it's a way to add iodide to a double bond or to cleave it. Oh! Wait, I think in the presence of red phosphorus, HI can add across double bonds. For example, in the addition of HI to alkenes, it can do a halohydrin formation or just add as HI. But with red phosphorus, perhaps it's a way to induce a certain addition.

Alternatively, I've heard of the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce ketones to alkanes. But that's with HCl, not HI. Wait, but wait: the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones (C=O) to CH2 groups using HCl and Zn(Hg). But here, the reagent is HI and red phosphorus. Maybe a similar reduction is happening.

Wait, here's a thought: perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is being reduced to CH2I. How? Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI could generate a phosphorus ylide, which could attack the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe the HI is acting as a nucleophile. So, for a formyl group, perhaps the reaction would add HI across the carbonyl, forming something like CH2I-O-... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is being converted into a CH2 group. Wait, but with HI and red phosphorus. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about each substituent's reaction.

The starting molecule has:

- A cyclohexene ring (double bond).
- A formyl group (CHO).
- A vinyl group (CH2=CH-).
- A carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

So after the reaction, what would happen to each of these groups?

Carboxylic acid: under what conditions does it react with HI and red phosphorus? I don't remember any typical reactions of carboxylic acids with these reagents. Maybe it's inert under these conditions. So the -COOH might remain unchanged.

The vinyl group is a double bond. If HI adds to it, perhaps it would become a diiodide. But if the reaction conditions favor addition, then the vinyl group would become CH2-I, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI in some way.

Wait, but when alkenes react with HI, it's typically an addition reaction. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI to form CH2-I-CH2-I? No, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, in HI addition to a double bond, each H and I would add across the double bond. So CH2=CH-R would become CH2I-CH2-R with HI. But wait, that's for a single addition. Wait, no, in the case of excess HI, perhaps more than one addition could happen, but alkenes usually only add once. So the vinyl group would become a CH2I group.

Wait, but the starting vinyl is attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the original structure would have a double bond as part of the vinyl group. If that adds HI, the double bond becomes a single bond with I atoms attached. So the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2I-CH2- attached to the ring. But wait, that would convert the double bond (vinyl) into a single bond, so that's a decrease in the index of hydrogen deficiency.

Similarly, the formyl group (CHO) might also react. If the formyl is converted into CH2I, that would change the structure.

Wait, so let's think about each group:

- Cyclohexene ring: double bond → if it reacts, it might become a single bond (so index decreases by 1).
- Formyl (CHO): converted into something else.
- Vinyl (CH2=CH-): converted into CH2I-CH2- (so double bond becomes single, index decreases by 1).

Now, the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is probably inert under these conditions, so it remains the same.

So, the starting material has three double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl) → 3 degrees of unsaturation.

If after reaction:

- The ring's double bond is gone (converted to single bond?), so that's minus 1.
- The vinyl double bond is gone, minus another 1.
- The formyl group's double bond (C=O) is also converted, perhaps to a single bond.

Wait, what's the product of the formyl group when reacted with HI and red phosphorus?

I think that when a carbonyl group (like formyl) reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it might undergo a reduction to form a CH2I group. Let me think: the formyl group (CHO) is attacked by HI, perhaps leading to the formation of CH2I. So the C=O becomes CH2I, which is a single bond. So that's another decrease in the index of hydrogen deficiency.

So, if all three double bonds are eliminated (ring, formyl, vinyl), how does that affect the index?

Wait, the initial index is 3. If all three double bonds are gone, the index would be zero. But wait, the ring itself is a double bond equivalent. So when the ring's double bond is opened, that would change things.

Wait, no. The ring is a cyclohexene, which has one double bond (i.e., one ring and one double bond: but in a cyclohexene, the ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so the degree of unsaturation is 1 (the ring) plus 1 (the double bond) = 2. Wait, no, the cyclohexene has one double bond in the ring. So the ring itself is a six-membered ring, which is one degree (since a ring is one degree). The double bond in the ring is another degree, so the cyclohexene has two degrees of unsaturation in the ring itself.

But wait, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as (number of rings + number of double bonds + number of triple bonds × 2). So, for the starting molecule:

- The cyclohexene ring: 1 ring, 1 double bond → that's 2 degrees.
- The formyl group: 1 double bond → +1.
- The vinyl group: 1 double bond → +1.
So total degrees: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Wait, but that can't be right because I thought earlier that the ring's double bond plus the ring's ring counts as two degrees. So the starting material would have 4 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, let's calculate this properly. The formula for calculating the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) is:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is hydrogen, X is halogens, N is nitrogen.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate it for the starting material to make sure.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think back to the reaction. The product would have the ring's double bond (cyclohexene) converted, the formyl group converted, and the vinyl group converted.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure.

After the reaction:

The cyclohexene ring's double bond is still there? Or is it opened? Because the reagents are HI and red phosphorus, which might cause addition reactions on double bonds.

Wait, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond within the ring). If HI adds to this double bond, it would break the ring. But that would require the ring to open, which would decrease the number of rings and could form a diol or similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reagents don't affect the ring's double bond but only the other double bonds (formyl and vinyl). So the ring remains as a cyclohexene, but the formyl and vinyl double bonds are converted.

Wait, if the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I, that would eliminate the C=O double bond. Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would add HI, becoming CH2I-CH2-. So, both of their double bonds are gone. The ring's double bond remains. So the product would have the ring's double bond (1 degree), and maybe other substituents.

So, the product's DoU would be 1 (from the ring), plus any new double bonds formed.

Wait, what about the reaction of the formyl group? If the formyl group is reduced to CH2OH, that would eliminate the C=O double bond. But if it's converted to CH2I, that would also eliminate the double bond. So in either case, the formyl group's DoU is lost.

Similarly, the vinyl group's DoU is lost when it reacts with HI.

So, the starting material had four degrees (assuming the ring is two and the others are two), but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has three degrees of unsaturation. Let me recalculate:

Starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Structure:

- Cyclohexene ring (6-membered) with a double bond (so one ring, one double bond → 2 degrees).
- Formyl group (CHO): one double bond → +1.
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-): another double bond → +1.
So total degrees: 2 + 1 +1 =4.

So starting material has four degrees.

After reaction:

If the formyl group is converted to CH2I (losing a double bond), vinyl group is converted to CH2I (losing another), and the ring's double bond may or may not remain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond. So in the product, the ring's double bond is still there (so DoU=1), and the other substituents no longer have double bonds.

So, the product's DoU is 1.

Because:

- The ring has one double bond → 1 DoU.
- The formyl and vinyl groups' double bonds are gone.

Wait, but the starting material had a carboxylic acid. Does that contribute to DoU? The -COOH group has a double bond (C=O), so that's another DoU.

Wait, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. The carboxylic acid group (COOH) has a double bond in the C=O. So the starting material has:

- Cyclohexene ring: 2 DoU (1 ring, 1 double bond)
- Formyl group: 1 DoU
- Vinyl group: 1 DoU
- Carboxylic acid: 1 DoU (C=O)
So total DoU is 2 +1 +1 +1 =5.

Wait, that's a big number. But I might have overcounted. Let me think again. Wait, no, the cyclohexene ring includes a double bond, but the carboxylic acid is a substituent on the ring. So the ring is part of the molecule, and the substituents are additional groups.

Wait, but the formula for DoU is based on the entire molecule. So let's calculate it properly.

Let me try to determine the formula for the starting material. Let's count the number of carbons. The cyclohexene is C6H8 (since cyclohexene is C6H10-2= C6H8? Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. Cyclohexene, with one double bond, would have C6H10. So, structure: cyclohexene ring (C6H10) plus substituents.

Wait, the substituents are:

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO) → adds one C, one O.
- At position 5: vinyl group (CH2CH2?), but that's likely CH2=CH2 attached as a substituent → adds two C's and a double bond.
- At position 1: carboxylic acid (COOH) → adds two O's, but for the purpose of formula, it adds -COOH, which is a functional group.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the molecular formula of the starting material.

The base is cyclohexene: C6H10.

Each substituent adds:

- At position 2: formyl (CHO) → which is OCHO? Wait, no, the formyl is CHO, which adds one C and one O, but also replaces a hydrogen on the ring. So the formula would be C6H10 → adding CHO (C1H O1) → C7H11O.

Wait, no. Let's think about the substituents:

The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the parent chain is the cyclohexene ring.

Breaking it down:

The formula would be:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) → but with substituents:

- At position 2: CHO (which is C=O-H, so substituent is CHO, so adds one C, one O, and two H's (since it's a substituent replacing a H on the ring).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each substituent adds to the ring's formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is better determined as:

The parent is cyclohexene: C6H10.

But with substituents:

- 2-formyl: formyl is CHO, which adds one C, one O, and the formula adjustment.
- 5-vinyl: vinyl is CH2=CH-, so adds two C's, one H, and a double bond.
- 3-enecarboxylic acid: so a COOH group at position 3. Wait, no, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the COOH is at position 1, and the double bond is at position 3.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Adding:

- formyl (CHO) → adds 1 C, 1 O.
- vinyl (CH2=CH-) → adds 2 C's, 3 H's (since CH2=CH- has two CH2 groups, but wait, CH2=CH- has 3 H's on the double bond. Hmm, maybe I should just count the substituent as a vinyl group, which is CH2CH2 with a double bond. So as a substituent, it's CH2CH2 where one of the CH2 is attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just think of the formula as:

The molecule has:

- 6 carbons in the ring.
- 1 formyl (CHO) → adds 1 C.
- 1 vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → adds 2 C's.
- 1 carboxylic acid group (COOH) → adds 2 O's but 1 C (since COOH is O2, but the C is already in the ring? No, wait, COOH is -COOH, which is O2, but the C is part of the ring. So the ring has a COOH substituent, which adds O's but no C's.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to write the molecular formula as:

Each substituent adds:

- Formyl: 1 C, 1 O.
- Vinyl: 2 C's, 1 O (if any? No, vinyl is just CH2=CH-. So no O's added.
- Carboxylic acid: 2 O's, but C is already part of the ring.

So the total carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C's.

Hydrogens: Let's see, cyclohexene is C6H10. Each substituent replaces a H.

Formyl (CHO) adds 1 H (since O is double bonded to C). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: the ring is C6H10. Each substitution replaces a H.

So, for each substituent:

- Formyl: replaces a H → so H count goes from 10 to 9.
- Vinyl: replaces a H → now 8.
- Carboxylic acid: replaces a H → 7.

But wait, the substituents may add more H's. For example, the formyl group is CHO, which has H attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the CHO group is attached as R-CHO, which adds one H (the H from CHO is part of the substituent).

But in the parent cyclohexene, each substituent replaces a H, but may add more H's based on their structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the molecular formula as:

Each substituent adds a certain number of H's.

Formyl (CHO) → -CHO has one H (the aldehyde H).
Vinyl (CH2=CH-) → the substituent is CH2-CH2 (but with a double bond, so perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, which would be CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent adds two H's: the CH2=CH- group has two H's on the CH2 group (attached to the ring) and two H's on the CH group across the double bond. Or perhaps each substituent adds more H's, but this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the DoU using the molecular formula. Let's assume the starting material has the formula C9H10O3 (just a guess). If the starting material has nine C's, then:

DoU = (2*9 +2 - H - X + N)/2.

But without knowing the exact formula, this approach is tricky.

Maybe I should move on and think about the product. If the formyl group is converted to CH2I, the vinyl group is converted to CH2I-CH2- (or similar), and the cyclohexene ring remains, then the product's structure would be:

Cyclohexene ring (with one double bond → 1 DoU) plus substituents that don't have double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps both the formyl and vinyl groups' double bonds are eliminated, and the cyclohexene's double bond remains. So the product has one DoU from the ring.

Wait, but what if the reaction also opens the ring's double bond? For example, if HI adds across the cyclohexene's double bond, the ring would open, converting the ring into a chain with two iodine substituents. But that would change the structure significantly and reduce the DoU.

But I'm not sure whether the reagents would react with the ring's double bond or just the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction only affects the substituents, leaving the ring's double bond intact.

In that case, the product would have the ring's double bond (1 DoU) and no other double bonds from substituents. So the DoU would be 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the ring's double bond is also converted, making the product completely saturated, leading to a DoU of 0. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's reconsider the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hittig reaction, which is a method to prepare alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of the formyl group.

Wait, another angle: when a carbonyl group (like formyl) reacts with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it undergoes a substitution to form a CH2I group. So the formyl (CHO) becomes CH2I. This would eliminate the C=O double bond, decreasing the DoU by 1.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would react with HI to become CH2I-CH2-, which would eliminate its double bond, decreasing DoU by another 1.

The cyclohexene's double bond remains, so DoU is 1.

So the product's DoU would be 1.

The options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

So the answer would be A)1.


The question asks for the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The DoU is calculated based on the number of rings, double bonds, and triple bonds in a molecule.
