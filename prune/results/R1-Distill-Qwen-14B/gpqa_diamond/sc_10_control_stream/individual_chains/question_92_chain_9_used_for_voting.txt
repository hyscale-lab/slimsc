Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me see if I can visualize its structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds. Maybe it's some sort of diene or something more complex? Not sure, but maybe the structure isn't as important as the bonds involved.

The problem gives me some bond energies:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy needed to break a C atom from its standard state into gaseous atoms. So each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous. But wait, bond energies are usually given per bond. Oh, wait, maybe the bond energies are for the specific bonds like C-C, C=C, etc.

Wait, the question gives bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. So the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. 

Wait, the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But wait, wait. No, that's not quite right. The enthalpy of formation is for the molecule from its elements. So you have to consider the bonds broken and formed.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break bonds in the reactants (like elements) and in the products (the molecule). So for the formation of a molecule, you consider the bonds in the reactants (e.g., breaking C-H bonds in methane if CH4 is a reactant), but in this case, the reactants are probably the elements: Carbon and Hydrogen. So, I think the formula is something like:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies required to break reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies released when product bonds form)

Wait, no, more accurately, enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the process where elements in their standard form (like C(graphite), H2) are broken into atoms, and then the molecule is formed from those atoms. So the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies needed to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies in the product molecule.

Wait, wait, no, the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds broken)] - [Σ (bond energies of product bonds formed)]

But wait, no, actually, the bond energies are for the bonds that are formed in the products and broken in the reactants. So more accurately, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) and the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, the calculation using bond energies would involve the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (reactants) and the energy released when the bonds in the compound (products) form.

Wait, perhaps a better way to approach this is through the atomization method. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated as:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies of the molecule)

Wait, no, that's not right. The process is:

1. Break the bonds in the elements (like C and H2) into their constituent atoms. This requires energy (endothermic).

2. Then, form the bonds in the molecule. This releases energy (exothermic), but the net is the enthalpy of formation.

So the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of elements)] - [Σ (bond energies of the molecule)]

Wait, that makes sense. Because you start with the elements, break their bonds (which requires energy), and then form the molecule's bonds, which releases energy.

So in this case, the molecule in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. But what about C≡C or other bonds? Hmm, the molecule probably has only single and double bonds, so we can ignore triple bonds here.

So, first, I need to determine how many H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds are in the molecule.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Let me start by drawing the structure.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Hmm, perhaps it's a polyene. Let's see:

Each CH3 group is a methyl group attached to a carbon chain. But wait, the structure seems to have double bonds.

Wait, the formula can be expanded as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Breaking it down:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-. So that's a propene group (since (CH3)2C=CH2 is isobutylene, but in this case, it's attached to another group).

Wait, perhaps each double bond is part of a larger structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's just count the number of each type of bond.

Each molecule has a certain number of C-C single bonds, C=C double bonds, C-H bonds, and any H-H bonds (but since the molecule has no H-H bonds, we can ignore that part).

Wait, but the molecule is made of C and H atoms. So, the bonds within the molecule are C-C, C=C, and C-H. So, we need to count all these bonds.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of each type of bond in the entire molecule and then apply the bond energies.

So, let's think about the entire molecule:

Let me count the number of each bond type.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 12 carbons. Let me see:

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let's count the carbons in each part:

(CH3)2C=CH-: That's 4 carbons (2 from each CH3, one central C, and the CH part is the fourth).

Wait, no, (CH3)2C=CH- is three carbons in the (CH3)2C group, then the double bond to CH.

Wait, perhaps I should write out the entire structure step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the formula as: 

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 4 carbons (since (CH3)2C is three carbons, and the CH is another, making four. Wait, (CH3)2C is (CH3)2-C, so that's three carbons: C attached to two CH3 groups, then attached via a double bond to another CH group. So that's part is (CH3)2C=CH-.

Then comes -CH2-, which is another carbon connected to two H's. Then CH(CH3), which is another carbon connected to a CH3 group and two other bonds. Then another CH2, and then CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a chain with two double bonds. Let's see:

The molecule is: 

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, from left to right:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : So, the first part is a propene group, but perhaps more accurately, it's an isobutylene group attached to a CH2.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Each molecule will have a certain number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

But wait, perhaps the molecule is a hydrocarbon with a certain number of each bond type.

But wait, perhaps a more systematic approach is to think about each type of bond:

1. Count the number of C-C single bonds.

2. Count the number of C=C double bonds.

3. Count the number of C-H bonds.

So, let's do that.

First, the entire molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C-C single bonds.

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

Let's go through each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 

In (CH3)2C, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups. So each CH3 contributes one C-C bond (since each CH3 is -CH2-CH3, but wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, the (CH3)2C group is a central carbon connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another carbon (the CH part). So the (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds: each CH3 is connected to the central C via a single bond.

So, two C-C bonds here.

Then, the CH is connected via a double bond (C=C) to the central C.

So, the C=C is a double bond, but we'll count that in the C=C count.

Next, the CH is attached to a CH2 group via a single C-C bond.

Wait, no, the structure after the double bond is a single bond to CH2.

So, that's a C-C single bond between the CH and the CH2.

Wait, but perhaps the CH from (CH3)2C=CH- is connected via a single C-C bond to the next CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the entire molecule as a chain with double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model the molecule as a series of connected carbons and count each C-C bond.

But this is getting a bit time-consuming. Maybe I should think about the number of each type.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a 1,3-pentadiene or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that the molecule has 12 carbons. Let me count them:

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, each (CH3)2C is three carbons (two methyl groups attached to a central C), then the =CH- is one more (so four), then CH2 is one, CH(CH3) is one, CH2 is another, CH=C is one, and (CH3)2 is two more. So let's see:

(CH3)2C (3C) + CH (1C) + CH2 (1C) + CH(CH3) (1C) + CH2 (1C) + CH=C(CH3)2 (2C: central C and the two CH3 groups). Wait, but that's a double bond, so perhaps it's one C connected via double bond to another. So perhaps:

Wait, perhaps each group contributes as follows:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 3 + 1 = 4 carbons.

- CH2- : 1.

- CH(CH3)-: 1.

- CH2-: 1.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 (the central C and the two in the CH3 groups).

Wait, but that adds up to 4 +1 +1 +1 +2 = 9 C, but I think I'm missing some. Perhaps I'm not counting correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 12 C as I thought earlier.

But perhaps this approach isn't the most efficient. Let's think differently.

Each molecule contributes a certain number of each bond type. Let's think about the molecule as consisting of a certain number of each type of bond.

Wait, another approach: for any hydrocarbon, the number of bonds can be calculated based on the number of valence electrons available.

Wait, each carbon has 4 valence electrons. Each hydrogen has 1. So the total valence electrons in the molecule would be:

Number of C atoms *4 + Number of H atoms *1.

But wait, in this molecule, each C and H's valence is used in bonding. So the total number of bonds can be calculated as (4nC + nH)/2. Because each bond is counted twice (once for each atom).

But perhaps that's overcomplicating it. Let me instead count the bonds.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 group contributes three C-H bonds. Let's count the C-H bonds.

First, in (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3 has three C-H bonds, so two CH3 groups contribute 2 *3 =6 C-H bonds. The central C in (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH, so no C-H there. The CH has one C-H bond.

So, in (CH3)2C=CH-, we have 6 +1=7 C-H bonds.

Next, the CH2 group after the double bond: each CH2 has two C-H bonds. So that's 2 C-H bonds.

Then, the CH(CH3) group: it has one C-H bond (the CH part) and the CH3 contributes three C-H bonds. Wait, no, the CH(CH3) group is a central C connected to one H, one CH2 group, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, wait: the formula is CH(CH3). So, the structure is CH2 connected to a CH3 group. Wait, no, the formula for that part is -CH(CH3)-. So, the C in CH(CH3) has two CH2 groups attached (previous and next), and one CH3.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: in the structure, CH(CH3) is a carbon connected to one H, one CH2 group, and one CH3 group. So, the C in CH(CH3) has three single bonds: to H, to CH2, and to CH3.

So, the C here has three single bonds. So the number of C-H bonds here is one.

Then, the next CH2 group: two C-H bonds.

Then, the CH=C(CH3)2 group: So, the CH is connected via a double bond to the C(CH3)2.

The CH has one C-H bond. The C in C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups attached, each contributing three C-H bonds. So, for each CH3, three C-H bonds, so two CH3 groups contribute 6 C-H bonds.

So, in the CH=C(CH3)2 group, the CH contributes one C-H bond, and the C(CH3)2 contributes 6 C-H bonds.

So, adding up all the C-H bonds:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 7

CH2-: 2

CH(CH3)-: 1

CH2-: 2

CH=C(CH3)2: 1 +6=7

So total C-H bonds = 7+2+1+2+7=19.

Wait, is that correct? Let me add again:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 7
- CH2: 2 → total 9
- CH(CH3): 1 → 10
- CH2: 2 → 12
- CH=C(CH3)2:7 → 19.

Wait, but wait, each CH3 group contributes three C-H bonds. Let's recount.

In (CH3)2C=CH-: each CH3 has 3 C-H, so 2 *3=6. The CH has 1, so 7.

CH2 has 2 → 9.

CH(CH3): the CH has 1, and the CH3 attached to it has 3 → total 4? Wait no, in CH(CH3), the CH is a single CH (1 C-H), and the CH3 is a group attached to that C. So, that CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds. So, the CH(CH3) group contributes 1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =4 C-H bonds.

Wait, but in the molecule, the part is "-CH(CH3)-". So, the C in CH(CH3) has two single bonds: one to the adjacent CH2 group, one to the CH3 group, and one to the next CH2 group. So, yes, that C has one H attached (as CH). So, that's one C-H bond, and the attached CH3 has three C-H bonds. So total 4 C-H bonds in this part.

So, let's recount:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 7 → 7.

CH2-: 2 → 9.

CH(CH3)-: 4 →13.

CH2-: 2 →15.

CH=C(CH3)2: CH part →1, and each CH3 in C(CH3)2 →3 each, so 2 *3=6. So 1+6=7 →15 +7=22.

Wait, but that's 22 C-H bonds. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, let me recount:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has two CH3 groups, each with 3 C-H → 6. The CH has 1 → total 7.

Then, the first CH2 after the double bond: 2 C-H.

Then, CH(CH3): 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) →4.

Next CH2: 2.

Then, the CH in CH=C: 1.

The C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups, each with 3 →6.

So 1+6=7.

So adding all: 7 +2 =9, +4=13, +2=15, +7=22.

So 22 C-H bonds.

Wait, but the molecule's formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds, and each CH2 contributes 2, each CH contributes 1.

Now, moving on to C-C bonds.

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

So, let's count each single bond.

Each (CH3)2C= is connected via a double bond, so no C-C there. But the C in (CH3)2C is connected to each CH3 via a C-C bond, so two C-C bonds.

Then, the (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH. So, the CH is connected via a single bond to the next CH2. So that's a C-C bond.

Then, the CH2 is connected to the next CH(CH3) via a C-C bond.

The CH(CH3) is connected to the next CH2 via a C-C bond.

The CH2 is connected to the next CH via a C-C bond.

The CH is connected via a double bond to the C in C(CH3)2. So, the double bond is C=C.

Then, the C(CH3)2 is connected via C-C bonds to any adjacent groups? Wait, no, in the structure, it's the end. So perhaps the C in C(CH3)2 is connected via single bonds to the two CH3 groups and via a double bond to the CH group.

So, the C-C bonds are:

- In (CH3)2C: two C-C bonds (each CH3 connected to the central C).

- Between CH and CH2: one C-C.

- Between CH2 and CH(CH3): one C-C.

- Between CH(CH3) and CH2: one C-C.

- Between CH2 and CH: one C-C.

So, that's 2 +1 +1 +1 +1 =6 C-C bonds.

Wait, but let me go through each part:

1. (CH3)2C: central C connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

2. The (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH, so no C-C there.

3. The CH is connected via a single bond to the next CH2 → one C-C.

4. The CH2 is connected to the next CH(CH3) → one C-C.

5. The CH(CH3) is connected to the next CH2 → one C-C.

6. The CH2 is connected to the next CH → one C-C.

7. The CH is connected via a double bond to the central C in C(CH3)2 → no C-C, but a C=C.

8. The C(CH3)2 is connected to two CH3 groups, each via a single C-C bond → two C-C bonds.

Wait, that would add more C-C bonds.

Wait, the C in C(CH3)2 is connected to two CH3 groups, which are themselves connected via C-C bonds. So each CH3 group attached to the central C has a C-C bond.

So, the C(CH3)2 part has two C-C bonds (each CH3 connected to the central C).

So, adding that:

So, the total C-C bonds would be:

- 2 (from (CH3)2C) +1 (CH-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH(CH3)) +1 (CH(CH3)-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH) +2 (from C(CH3)2) → 2+1+1+1+1+2=8.

Wait, that makes 8 C-C bonds.

Wait, let me recount:

1. (CH3)2C: 2 C-C bonds.

2. CH connected to CH2: 1.

3. CH2 connected to CH(CH3): 1.

4. CH(CH3) connected to CH2: 1.

5. CH2 connected to CH: 1.

6. C(CH3)2: 2.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1+2 = 8.

So 8 C-C bonds.

Now, the C=C bonds.

Looking at the molecule, I see two double bonds.

In (CH3)2C=CH- and CH=C(CH3)2.

Each is a double bond, so two C=C bonds.

So, 2 C=C bonds.

So now, what's the sum of bond energies for the molecule?

Each C-C bond contributes +200 kJ/mol, but since they are being counted as bonds in the molecule, each C-C bond in the product contributes to the energy released when formed. So, in the calculation, we'll sum the bond energies of the product bonds.

Wait, the formula for the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = sum (bond energies of reactant bonds broken) - sum (bond energies of product bonds formed)

Wait, but in this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states: C and H2.

So, the bond energies of reactant bonds are the bonds in the elements. For C, the bond is a C-C bond (in graphite, but perhaps it's taken as the bond energy given, which is 200 kJ/mol). But wait, wait. The bond energy given is for C-C single bond. So, each C in graphite is bonded with three other C atoms, but the bond energy given is for a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) to form gaseous atoms, and then the energy released when the product bonds form.

So, the process is:

1. Break the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) into gaseous atoms. This requires energy.

2. Form bonds in the product molecule. This releases energy.

The enthalpy of formation is the net energy (energy in - energy out).

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds) ] - [Σ (bond energies of product bonds) ]

But wait, for the reactants, the bonds to break are the C-C bonds in graphite (but perhaps for carbon, since it's in its standard state as graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous.

Similarly, H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, so each H-H bond requires 100 kJ/mol to break.

So, for the reactants (C and H2), the total bond energy to break is:

Number of C atoms * (enthalpy of atomization per C) + Number of H2 molecules * (H-H bond energy).

Wait, but the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's find out how many C and H atoms are in the molecule.

Each molecule has:

- Each (CH3)2C group: 3 C and 6 H (since 2 CH3 groups contribute 2*3=6 H).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the molecular formula.

Looking at the formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3) group is CH3: 3 H.

In (CH3)2C=CH-: 

- (CH3)2C has 2 CH3 → 2*3=6 H.

- The =CH- is CH2 (since it's CH2 connected via double bond?), but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each (CH3)2C=CH- group contributes 3 C and 7 H.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count each atom:

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is a CH3 group. So, let's count C and H.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 

- 2 CH3 → 2*(1 C +3 H) = 2 C +6 H.

- The central C: 1 C.

- The =CH-: 1 C connected via double bond, and 1 H.

So, in this group: 2+1+1=4 C, and 6 +1=7 H.

2. Then, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-:

- -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.

- -CH(CH3)-: 1 C, 1 H (since CH has one H) +3 H (from CH3) → but wait, no. The CH(CH3) group has the central C connected to one H, one CH2 group, and one CH3 group. So, the H is only one.

So, CH(CH3) contributes 1 C, 1 H.

- -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.

3. Then, -CH=C(CH3)2:

- CH: 1 C, 1 H.

- C=C: the central C is connected to two CH3 groups. Each CH3 contributes 3 H.

So, C(CH3)2 contributes 2 C and 2*(3 H) =6 H.

Putting it all together:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 4 C, 7 H.

- -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: three parts:

   - CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

   - CH(CH3): 1 C, 1 H.

   - CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

   So, total 3 C, 5 H.

- -CH=C(CH3)2: 3 C (1 from CH, 2 from C(CH3)2) → wait, no. 

Wait, CH=C(CH3)2 has:

- CH: 1 C, 1 H.

- C=C: the central C is connected to the CH and two CH3 groups.

So, the central C (from C=C) is connected to CH and two CH3.

So, the C in CH is 1 C, and the C in C=C is 1 C, and each CH3 is 1 C, so total for this group is 1 +1 +2*1=4 C.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach it differently.

The molecule seems to have 12 carbons in total.

But perhaps another approach is better.

Each (CH3) group contributes one C and three H. So, in the entire molecule, each (CH3) is present in several places.

Let me count the number of (CH3) groups:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 2.

- CH(CH3): 1.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 2.

So, that's 2 +1 +2 =5 CH3 groups. Each contributes 3 H, so 5 *3=15 H from CH3.

Additionally, there are H's in other parts like CH2 and CH.

Let me list all the H's:

- In (CH3)2C=CH-: 7 H (as counted earlier).

- In CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH= group: 2 (from first CH2) +1 (from CH) +2 (from second CH2) →5 H.

- In CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (from CH) +6 (from two CH3) →7 H.

So total H is 7 +5 +7 =19 H. So, each molecule has 19 H atoms.

Wait, but earlier I thought the C-H bonds are 22, but each H atom contributes one bond. So, 19 H atoms →19 C-H bonds? Wait, no, because each C can have multiple H's.

Wait, no, each H is bonded to a C. So, the number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of H atoms, which is 19.

But earlier, I thought there were 22 C-H bonds. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, perhaps earlier I counted the C-H bonds as 22, but that's incorrect. Let me recount.

Each H atom is part of a C-H bond, so the number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of H atoms in the molecule.

So, if the molecule has 19 H atoms, then there are 19 C-H bonds.

But earlier, I thought I had 22 C-H bonds. That suggests I made a mistake in counting.

So, perhaps I should recount the H's.

Let me go through the molecule again:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3) group: 3 H.

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

- Each CH3 contributes 3 H → 2*3=6.

- The CH (from =CH-) has 1 H.

So, 6 +1=7 H.

Then, the next parts:

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH(CH3): 1 H (the CH part) +3 H (from CH3) →4 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H →2*3=6. So, 1 +6=7 H.

Adding all H's: 7 (from first part) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (CH=C...) = 7+2=9; 9+4=13; 13+2=15; 15+7=22 H atoms. Wait, that's 22 H atoms.

But earlier, when I thought about the structure, I thought each H is part of a C-H bond, so the number of C-H bonds equals the number of H atoms, which would be 22.

So, 22 C-H bonds.

So, the H's are 22.

But earlier, when I thought about the total valence electrons, perhaps I should check that.

Wait, the molecule has:

Number of C atoms: let's count.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has 3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 C (from =CH-) →4 C.

Then, CH2 adds 1 C.

CH(CH3) adds 1 C.

CH2 adds another 1 C.

CH adds another 1 C.

C in C(CH3)2 adds 1 C.

Wait, but that's 4 (first group) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH) +1 (C in C(CH3)2) → 9 C. But that can't be right because each (CH3)2C=CH- is three C's plus one from CH, etc.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write the formula in a way that each carbon is counted:

The formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each group:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 C (from CH) →4 C.

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH(CH3): 1 C.

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH: 1 C.

- C(CH3)2: 1 C.

So, total C: 4 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =9 C.

Wait, but that's only 9 C. But the formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let's consider each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (from (CH3)2C) and 1 C (from =CH-).

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH(CH3): 1 C.

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH: 1 C.

- C(CH3)2: 1 C.

Adding up: 3+1 +1+1+1+1=8 C.

Wait, perhaps I missed one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula has 12 C as I thought earlier. But perhaps the correct way is to note that the formula has 12 C and 22 H.

So, 12 C and 22 H.

So, each molecule has 12 C and 22 H atoms.

So, the bond energies for the product (the molecule) are:

- Number of C-C bonds: 8 →8 *200 kJ/mol = 1600 kJ/mol.

- Number of C=C bonds: 2 →2 *300=600 kJ/mol.

- Number of C-H bonds:22 →22 *400=8800 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. The bond energies are in kJ/mol, so each bond contributes, and the total is the sum.

But wait, in the formation reaction, the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) are broken, and the bonds in the product are formed.

So, the reactants are:

12 C atoms (each as C in graphite) and (22 H atoms) which come from H2 molecules. So, each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms, so number of H2 molecules is 22/2=11.

So, the bonds to break are:

- C atoms: each C in graphite is bonded to three others, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol per C atom. So, for 12 C atoms, the energy to break into gaseous C atoms is 12 *1000 =12,000 kJ/mol.

- H2 molecules: each H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. There are 11 H2 molecules (since 22 H atoms →11 H2 molecules). So, bond energy is 11 *100=1100 kJ/mol.

So, total energy to break reactant bonds: 12,000 +1100=13,100 kJ/mol.

Now, the bonds formed in the product are:

C-C bonds:8 →8 *200=1600.

C=C bonds:2 →2 *300=600.

C-H bonds:22 →22 *400=8800.

Total bonds formed:1600+600+8800=11,000 kJ/mol.

So, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break reactants (13,100) minus the energy released when forming products (11,000).

ΔHf = 13,100 -11,000 =2,100 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me double-check the math:

13,100 -11,000 =2,100 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, option A is 11,200 kJ/mol, which doesn't match. Option B is 67.4, which is way lower. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is specific and low. Option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is also specific and high.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C bonds.

Earlier, I had 8 C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Number of C-C bonds:

Each single bond between two carbons.

Looking at the structure:

1. (CH3)2C: two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to central C).

2. (CH3)2C connected to CH via double bond, so no C-C there.

3. CH connected to CH2 →1 C-C.

4. CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

5. CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

6. CH2 connected to CH →1.

7. CH connected to C in C(CH3)2 via double bond → no C-C.

8. C in C(CH3)2 connected to two CH3 groups →2 C-C bonds.

So, that's 8 C-C bonds.

So, 8 *200=1600.

The C=C bonds:2 →2*300=600.

C-H bonds:22 →22*400=8800.

Total product bonds:1600+600+8800=11,000.

Reactant bonds:

12 C atoms →12 *1000=12,000.

H2 →11 H2 →11 *100=1100.

Total reactant bonds:13,100.

ΔHf=13,100-11,000=2,100 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I miscounted the number of H atoms.

Wait, the molecule has 22 H atoms, so 11 H2 molecules, each contributing a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. So 11 *100=1100.

So, that part is correct.

Another possibility is that I miscounted the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, let me recount the C-C bonds.

- (CH3)2C: 2 C-C.

- CH-CH2:1.

- CH2-CH(CH3):1.

- CH(CH3)-CH2:1.

- CH2-CH:1.

- C(CH3)2:2 C-C.

So, 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 → correct.

Hmm. So the calculation leads to 2,100 kJ/mol, but none of the options match. The options are 11,200; 67.4; 11.44; 1900.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the bond energies.

Wait, the problem states the bond energies:

Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.

So, each C atom in graphite requires 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous. So, 12 C atoms →12,000.

H-H bond energy is 100 kJ/mol, so each H2 molecule requires 100 kJ to break.

So, 11 H2 →1100.

Product bonds: 8 C-C (1600), 2 C=C (600), 22 C-H (8800). Total 11,000.

So, ΔHf=13,100 -11,000 =2,100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. Maybe the molecule has more.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond energies are in kJ per bond, not per mole.

Wait, the question gives bond energies as:

Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol.

So, each H-H bond contributes 100 kJ/mol per mole of H2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of per mole of molecule. Since the problem is about the formation of 1 mole of the molecule, the calculation is per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the number of bonds.

Wait, another approach: let's calculate the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Number of C-C single bonds: Each C-C bond is a single bond.

In the molecule:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- part contributes two C-C bonds (between the central C and each CH3).

Then, the CH is connected via a single bond to the next CH2 →1.

The CH2 is connected to CH(CH3) →1.

The CH(CH3) is connected to next CH2 →1.

The CH2 is connected to CH →1.

The CH is connected via a double bond to the C in C(CH3)2 → no C-C.

The C in C(CH3)2 is connected to two CH3 groups →2.

So, 2 +1+1+1+1 +2 =8 C-C bonds.

So, 8 is correct.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

Number of C-H bonds:22.

So, 8*200=1600, 2*300=600, 22*400=8800. Sum=11,000.

Reactants: 12,000 (C) +1100 (H2) →13,100.

ΔHf=13,100-11,000=2,100 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match this.

Looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in gaseous form, but the question doesn't specify whether the formation is from graphite and H2 gas, which it should be.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I miscounted the number of C atoms.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C atoms step by step.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 (from CH) →4 C.

CH2:1.

CH(CH3):1.

CH2:1.

CH:1.

C in C(CH3)2:1.

So, 4+1+1+1+1+1=9 C. So, the molecule has 9 C atoms.

Ah! I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought the molecule has 12 C, but upon recounting, it's 9 C.

So, number of C atoms:9.

H atoms: as before, 22.

So, the bonds in reactants:

C:9 →9 *1000=9,000.

H2:22/2=11 →11 *100=1,100.

Total reactant bonds: 9,000 +1,100=10,100 kJ/mol.

Product bonds:

C-C:8 →8 *200=1,600.

C=C:2 →2*300=600.

C-H:22 →22 *400=8,800.

Total product bonds:1,600+600+8,800=11,000.

So, ΔHf=10,100 -11,000= -900 kJ/mol.

But that's negative, and the options don't have negative numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = sum of bond energies of reactants (broken) - sum of bond energies of products (formed).

So, if the product bonds are stronger (lower energy), the sum would be positive.

Wait, in this case, 10,100 (reactants) -11,000 (products) = -900.

Which would be exothermic. But none of the options have negative values.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the C's.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a CH3.

Let me write the entire structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- →3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 C (from CH) →4 C.

2. CH2 →1 C.

3. CH(CH3) →1 C.

4. CH2 →1 C.

5. CH →1 C.

6. C(CH3)2 →1 C.

So, 4 +1+1+1+1+1=9 C.

So, 9 C, 22 H.

So, reactant bonds:

9 C →9 *1000=9,000.

22 H →11 H2 →11 *100=1,100.

Total reactant bonds broken:10,100.

Product bonds formed:

8 C-C →8 *200=1,600.

2 C=C →2 *300=600.

22 C-H →22 *400=8,800.

Total product bonds:1,600 +600 +8,800=11,000.

ΔHf = 10,100 -11,000 = -900 kJ/mol.

But this is not matching any options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the bond counts or in the structure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds. Let me recount:

After the (CH3)2C=CH- group:

- CH is connected to CH2 →1 C-C.

- CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

- CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

- CH2 connected to CH →1.

- CH connected to C in C(CH3)2 → no C-C (double bond).

- C in C(CH3)2 connected to two CH3 groups →2 C-C.

So, 2 (from (CH3)2C) +1 +1 +1 +1 +2=8. Correct.

Hmm. So the calculation leads to -900 kJ/mol, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me re-express the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to count the number of each type of bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the formula:

ΔHf = (sum of (bond energies of elements)) - (sum of bond energies of the molecule)

But for the elements, each C-C bond in graphite has a bond energy of 200 kJ/mol, but the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.

So, perhaps the correct calculation is:

Enthalpy of formation = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization) + (number of H2 molecules × H-H bond energy) ] - [ (number of C-C bonds × bond energy) + (number of C=C bonds × bond energy) + (number of C-H bonds × bond energy) ]

So, using the correct numbers:

Number of C atoms =9.

Number of H2 molecules=11.

So,

Reactant bonds: 9×1000 +11×100 =9,000 +1,100 =10,100.

Product bonds:8×200 +2×300 +22×400=1,600 +600 +8,800=11,000.

ΔHf=10,100 -11,000= -900.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is not in its standard state, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I counted the H atoms. Let me recount the H's.

Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the H's in each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

   Each CH3 has 3 H →2×3=6.

   The CH has 1 H.

   Total:7.

2. CH2-:

   2 H.

3. CH(CH3)-:

   CH has 1 H.

   CH3 has 3 H.

   Total:4.

4. CH2-:

   2 H.

5. CH-:

   1 H.

6. C(CH3)2:

   Each CH3 has 3 H →2×3=6.

   So, 6 H.

Adding up:7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6=22 H.

So, 22 H atoms.

So, the product bonds are:

C-C:8 →1600.

C=C:2→600.

C-H:22→8800.

Total product bonds:11,000.

So, ΔHf=10,100-11,000= -900.

Hmm, this is perplexing.

Looking back at the options, the only one close to 11,000 is option A:11,200.

But our calculation shows 11,000 for the product bonds. So perhaps the given option is 11,200, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I missed some bonds.

Wait, perhaps I missed a C-C bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 9 C atoms, and each C has four bonds, so:

Each C has four bonds, so total bonds are (9×4)/2=18.

But wait, in the molecule, the bonds are:

C-C:8 →8 bonds.

C=C:2 →2 bonds.

C-H:22 →22 bonds.

Total bonds:8+2+22=32.

Wait, but each C can have four bonds.

Wait, 9 C atoms ×4 =36 bonds.

But since each bond connects two atoms, the total actual bonds would be 36/2=18 bonds.

But according to our count, the product bonds are 8+2+22=32 bonds. That's not correct because it exceeds 18.

Wait, this suggests that our count of bonds is way off. Because with 9 C atoms, the total bonds can't exceed (9×4)/2=18.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to recount the number of bonds in the molecule.

Each C can form four bonds.

Let me try to count the number of each type of bond correctly.

Given the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

I'll number the carbons from left to right as C1 to C9.

C1: connected to two CH3 groups and C2 via double bond.

C2: connected to C1 via double bond, and to C3.

C3: connected to C2, C4, and two H's.

C4: connected to C3, C5, and two H's.

C5: connected to C4, C6, and a CH3 group.

C6: connected to C5, C7, and two H's.

C7: connected to C6, C8 via double bond, and one H.

C8: connected to C7 via double bond, and two CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps this is a better way to count the bonds.

So, each C has four bonds.

C1: (CH3)2-C=CH-

C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (2 C-C bonds), and a double bond to C2 (counts as 1 bond, but it's a double bond, so contributes 2 bonds? No, in terms of bonds, each C=C is a single bond but with double bond energy.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to count the number of each type of bond present.

But perhaps it's better to abandon this approach and consider that maybe the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol.

But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the enthalpy of atomization, not the formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of H2 molecules. If the molecule has 22 H atoms, it requires 11 H2 molecules. So, 11×100=1,100.

But perhaps the H-H bond energy is 100 per H2, which is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break C-C bonds in graphite to get gaseous C atoms. So, the bond energy for C-C in graphite is 200 kJ/mol, but the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.

So, each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous, regardless of its bonding in the solid.

So, for 9 C atoms, it's 9×1000=9,000.

So, the initial approach is correct.

But even then, the calculation gives ΔHf= -900 kJ/mol, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the correct answer isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 11,200 kJ/mol. Which is close to the sum of the product bonds (11,000). But why would the enthalpy of formation be positive and that high?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break the molecule into atoms, not the reverse. So, perhaps I should subtract the way around.

Wait, if the formula is ΔHf = sum of product bonds - sum of reactant bonds.

But that would give 11,000 -10,100=900 kJ/mol.

But then, the enthalpy of formation would be positive 900, which is also not an option.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the formation.

The enthalpy of atomization would be the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule into atoms. So, that would be sum of product bonds.

Which is 11,000 kJ/mol. But the option A is 11,200, which is close.

But the question specifically asks for the enthalpy of formation, not atomization.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I missed a C-C bond. Let me recount.

In the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: C1 connected to two CH3 →2 C-C.

- C2 connected to C1 via double bond (no C-C), and to C3 →1 C-C.

- C3 connected to C2, C4 →1 C-C.

- C4 connected to C3, C5 →1 C-C.

- C5 connected to C4, C6 →1 C-C.

- C6 connected to C5, C7 →1 C-C.

- C7 connected to C6, C8 via double bond → no C-C.

- C8 connected to C7 via double bond (no C-C), and to two CH3 →2 C-C.

So, 2+1+1+1+1+1+2=9 C-C bonds.

Wait, that's 9 C-C bonds.

Ah! So earlier count was incorrect. The correct number is 9 C-C bonds.

So, C-C bonds:9 →9 ×200=1,800.

C=C bonds:2 →2 ×300=600.

C-H bonds:22 →22 ×400=8,800.

Total product bonds:1,800 +600 +8,800=11,200.

Now, the reactant bonds:

C:9 ×1000=9,000.

H:11 ×100=1,100.

Total reactant bonds:10,100.

So, ΔHf=10,100 -11,200= -1,100 kJ/mol.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but wait: the product bonds sum to 11,200, which is option A.

But the calculation gives ΔHf= -1,100.

Hmm, perhaps the question is actually asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, which is 11,200 kJ/mol, matching option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the product minus the sum of the reactants. So,

ΔHf= sum (product bonds) - sum (reactant bonds).

Which would be 11,200 -10,100=1,100 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the sum of the bond energies of the molecule, which is 11,200 kJ/mol, as option A.

But the question asks for the enthalpy of formation, not the atomization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds, and not the H-H bonds because the molecule doesn't contain H-H bonds.

Wait, but in the reactants, we have H2 molecules, which have H-H bonds.

So, perhaps the option A is 11,200 kJ/mol, which is the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds.

But the correct calculation for enthalpy of formation is 10,100 -11,200= -1,100.

But again, this isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem made a mistake, and the correct answer is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds.

Wait, with 9 C-C bonds, the sum is 1,800. Then product bonds sum to 1,800+600+8,800=11,200.

If the question asks for the bond energy content of the molecule, then option A is correct.

But the question specifically asks for the enthalpy of formation, which is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C atoms. Let me recount.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a substituent.

Let me count each C:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 C (from CH) →4.

2. CH2: 1 C.

3. CH(CH3):1 C.

4. CH2:1 C.

5. CH:1 C.

6. C(CH3)2:1 C.

Total:4+1+1+1+1+1=9 C.

So, 9 C.

So, the product bonds sum to 11,200, but the formation is -1,100, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy of formation as the sum of bond energies of the product, not considering the reactants. So, 11,200 kJ/mol, which is option A.

But that's not the correct approach for enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B:67.4.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. If the molecule has 5 C-C bonds, for example.

But I'm not seeing where.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 6 C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should try the calculation again with 9 C-C bonds.

So, product bonds:9*200=1,800.

C=C:2*300=600.

C-H:22*400=8,800.

Sum:1,800+600+8,800=11,200.

Reactant bonds:

9*1000=9,000.

11*100=1,100.

Total reactant bonds=10,100.

ΔHf=10,100 -11,200= -1,100.

But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the average bond energy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is being considered as 1 mole of the molecule, but the calculation is per gram, not per mole.

Wait, the options C and D are per gram.

If the molecular weight is, say, 144 g/mol, then 67.4 kJ/mol would be 67.4/144 ≈0.468 kJ/g.

But option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation per gram.

Wait, molecular weight is 9 C (12*9=108) +22 H (1*22=22) →130 g/mol.

So, 130 g is 1 mol.

If the enthalpy of formation is 11,200 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 11,200 /130 ≈86.15 kJ/g. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, if it's -1,100 kJ/mol, per gram it's -1,100 /130≈-8.46 kJ/g. Still not matching.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11,200 kJ/mol, as it matches the sum of the product bonds.

But I'm not certain. Since none of the other options make sense, perhaps the intended answer is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were taken:

### Key Information and Assumptions:
1. **Bond Energies**:
   - C-C: 200 kJ/mol
   - C=C: 300 kJ/mol
   - C-H: 400 kJ/mol
   - H-H: 100 kJ/mol
   - Enthalpy of atomization of carbon: 1000 kJ/mol

2. **Structure Analysis**:
   - The molecule contains **9 carbon atoms** and **22 hydrogen atoms**.
   - **C-C bonds**: 9 (each contributing 200 kJ/mol).
   - **C=C bonds**: 2 (each contributing 300 kJ/mol).
   - **C-H bonds**: 22 (each contributing 400 kJ/mol).

3. **Reactants**:
   - Carbon (C): 9 atoms, each requiring 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous.
   - Hydrogen (H₂): 11 molecules (since 22 H atoms are present), each requiring 100 kJ/mol to break the H-H bond.

4. **Enthalpy of Formation Formula**:
   - ΔHf° = (Sum of bond energies of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of products).

### Calculations:
1. **Reactant Bonds**:
   - Carbon: \( 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - Hydrogen: \( 11 \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - Total reactant bonds: \( 9000 + 1100 = 10100 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

2. **Product Bonds**:
   - C-C bonds: \( 9 \times 200 = 1800 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - C=C bonds: \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - C-H bonds: \( 22 \times 400 = 8800 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - Total product bonds: \( 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

3. **Enthalpy of Formation**:
   - \( \Delta H_f^\circ = 10100 - 11200 = -1100 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**: This matches the total bond energy of the product bonds but does not represent the enthalpy of formation, which is the net energy change.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This value does not align with any intermediate or final calculation.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)**: This appears to be a per-gram value, but the calculations do not support this number.
- **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: Similarly, this per-gram value is inconsistent with the calculations.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible answer based on the calculations is **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**, as it corresponds to the total bond energy of the product bonds, even though it does not represent the enthalpy of formation. None of the other options align with the derived values.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me see if I can visualize its structure. It looks like a molecule with two double bonds. Maybe it's some sort of diene or something more complex? Not sure, but maybe the structure isn't as important as the bonds involved.

The problem gives me some bond energies:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy needed to break a C atom from its standard state into gaseous atoms. So each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous. But wait, bond energies are usually given per bond. Oh, wait, maybe the bond energies are for the specific bonds like C-C, C=C, etc.

Wait, the question gives bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. So the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the bond energies. 

Wait, the formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But wait, wait. No, that's not quite right. The enthalpy of formation is for the molecule from its elements. So you have to consider the bonds broken and formed.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break bonds in the reactants (like elements) and in the products (the molecule). So for the formation of a molecule, you consider the bonds in the reactants (e.g., breaking C-H bonds in methane if CH4 is a reactant), but in this case, the reactants are probably the elements: Carbon and Hydrogen. So, I think the formula is something like:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies required to break reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies released when product bonds form)

Wait, no, more accurately, enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the process where elements in their standard form (like C(graphite), H2) are broken into atoms, and then the molecule is formed from those atoms. So the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies needed to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies in the product molecule.

Wait, wait, no, the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds broken)] - [Σ (bond energies of product bonds formed)]

But wait, no, actually, the bond energies are for the bonds that are formed in the products and broken in the reactants. So more accurately, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) and the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, the calculation using bond energies would involve the energy required to break the bonds in the elements (reactants) and the energy released when the bonds in the compound (products) form.

Wait, perhaps a better way to approach this is through the atomization method. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated as:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of elements) - (sum of bond energies of the molecule)

Wait, no, that's not right. The process is:

1. Break the bonds in the elements (like C and H2) into their constituent atoms. This requires energy (endothermic).

2. Then, form the bonds in the molecule. This releases energy (exothermic), but the net is the enthalpy of formation.

So the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of elements)] - [Σ (bond energies of the molecule)]

Wait, that makes sense. Because you start with the elements, break their bonds (which requires energy), and then form the molecule's bonds, which releases energy.

So in this case, the molecule in question is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. But what about C≡C or other bonds? Hmm, the molecule probably has only single and double bonds, so we can ignore triple bonds here.

So, first, I need to determine how many H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds are in the molecule.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me count the number of each type of bond.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Let me start by drawing the structure.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Hmm, perhaps it's a polyene. Let's see:

Each CH3 group is a methyl group attached to a carbon chain. But wait, the structure seems to have double bonds.

Wait, the formula can be expanded as:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Breaking it down:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-. So that's a propene group (since (CH3)2C=CH2 is isobutylene, but in this case, it's attached to another group).

Wait, perhaps each double bond is part of a larger structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated diene.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's just count the number of each type of bond.

Each molecule has a certain number of C-C single bonds, C=C double bonds, C-H bonds, and any H-H bonds (but since the molecule has no H-H bonds, we can ignore that part).

Wait, but the molecule is made of C and H atoms. So, the bonds within the molecule are C-C, C=C, and C-H. So, we need to count all these bonds.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of each type of bond in the entire molecule and then apply the bond energies.

So, let's think about the entire molecule:

Let me count the number of each bond type.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 12 carbons. Let me see:

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, let's count the carbons in each part:

(CH3)2C=CH-: That's 4 carbons (2 from each CH3, one central C, and the CH part is the fourth).

Wait, no, (CH3)2C=CH- is three carbons in the (CH3)2C group, then the double bond to CH.

Wait, perhaps I should write out the entire structure step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the formula as: 

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 4 carbons (since (CH3)2C is three carbons, and the CH is another, making four. Wait, (CH3)2C is (CH3)2-C, so that's three carbons: C attached to two CH3 groups, then attached via a double bond to another CH group. So that's part is (CH3)2C=CH-.

Then comes -CH2-, which is another carbon connected to two H's. Then CH(CH3), which is another carbon connected to a CH3 group and two other bonds. Then another CH2, and then CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a chain with two double bonds. Let's see:

The molecule is: 

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, from left to right:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : So, the first part is a propene group, but perhaps more accurately, it's an isobutylene group attached to a CH2.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds in the molecule.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Each molecule will have a certain number of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

But wait, perhaps the molecule is a hydrocarbon with a certain number of each bond type.

But wait, perhaps a more systematic approach is to think about each type of bond:

1. Count the number of C-C single bonds.

2. Count the number of C=C double bonds.

3. Count the number of C-H bonds.

So, let's do that.

First, the entire molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C-C single bonds.

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

Let's go through each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 

In (CH3)2C, the central C is connected to two CH3 groups. So each CH3 contributes one C-C bond (since each CH3 is -CH2-CH3, but wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, the (CH3)2C group is a central carbon connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to another carbon (the CH part). So the (CH3)2C group has two C-C bonds: each CH3 is connected to the central C via a single bond.

So, two C-C bonds here.

Then, the CH is connected via a double bond (C=C) to the central C.

So, the C=C is a double bond, but we'll count that in the C=C count.

Next, the CH is attached to a CH2 group via a single C-C bond.

Wait, no, the structure after the double bond is a single bond to CH2.

So, that's a C-C single bond between the CH and the CH2.

Wait, but perhaps the CH from (CH3)2C=CH- is connected via a single C-C bond to the next CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the entire molecule as a chain with double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model the molecule as a series of connected carbons and count each C-C bond.

But this is getting a bit time-consuming. Maybe I should think about the number of each type.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a 1,3-pentadiene or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that the molecule has 12 carbons. Let me count them:

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, each (CH3)2C is three carbons (two methyl groups attached to a central C), then the =CH- is one more (so four), then CH2 is one, CH(CH3) is one, CH2 is another, CH=C is one, and (CH3)2 is two more. So let's see:

(CH3)2C (3C) + CH (1C) + CH2 (1C) + CH(CH3) (1C) + CH2 (1C) + CH=C(CH3)2 (2C: central C and the two CH3 groups). Wait, but that's a double bond, so perhaps it's one C connected via double bond to another. So perhaps:

Wait, perhaps each group contributes as follows:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : 3 + 1 = 4 carbons.

- CH2- : 1.

- CH(CH3)-: 1.

- CH2-: 1.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 2 (the central C and the two in the CH3 groups).

Wait, but that adds up to 4 +1 +1 +1 +2 = 9 C, but I think I'm missing some. Perhaps I'm not counting correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 12 C as I thought earlier.

But perhaps this approach isn't the most efficient. Let's think differently.

Each molecule contributes a certain number of each bond type. Let's think about the molecule as consisting of a certain number of each type of bond.

Wait, another approach: for any hydrocarbon, the number of bonds can be calculated based on the number of valence electrons available.

Wait, each carbon has 4 valence electrons. Each hydrogen has 1. So the total valence electrons in the molecule would be:

Number of C atoms *4 + Number of H atoms *1.

But wait, in this molecule, each C and H's valence is used in bonding. So the total number of bonds can be calculated as (4nC + nH)/2. Because each bond is counted twice (once for each atom).

But perhaps that's overcomplicating it. Let me instead count the bonds.

Wait, the molecule is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each CH3 group contributes three C-H bonds. Let's count the C-H bonds.

First, in (CH3)2C=CH-:

Each CH3 has three C-H bonds, so two CH3 groups contribute 2 *3 =6 C-H bonds. The central C in (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH, so no C-H there. The CH has one C-H bond.

So, in (CH3)2C=CH-, we have 6 +1=7 C-H bonds.

Next, the CH2 group after the double bond: each CH2 has two C-H bonds. So that's 2 C-H bonds.

Then, the CH(CH3) group: it has one C-H bond (the CH part) and the CH3 contributes three C-H bonds. Wait, no, the CH(CH3) group is a central C connected to one H, one CH2 group, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, wait: the formula is CH(CH3). So, the structure is CH2 connected to a CH3 group. Wait, no, the formula for that part is -CH(CH3)-. So, the C in CH(CH3) has two CH2 groups attached (previous and next), and one CH3.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: in the structure, CH(CH3) is a carbon connected to one H, one CH2 group, and one CH3 group. So, the C in CH(CH3) has three single bonds: to H, to CH2, and to CH3.

So, the C here has three single bonds. So the number of C-H bonds here is one.

Then, the next CH2 group: two C-H bonds.

Then, the CH=C(CH3)2 group: So, the CH is connected via a double bond to the C(CH3)2.

The CH has one C-H bond. The C in C(CH3)2 has two CH3 groups attached, each contributing three C-H bonds. So, for each CH3, three C-H bonds, so two CH3 groups contribute 6 C-H bonds.

So, in the CH=C(CH3)2 group, the CH contributes one C-H bond, and the C(CH3)2 contributes 6 C-H bonds.

So, adding up all the C-H bonds:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 7

CH2-: 2

CH(CH3)-: 1

CH2-: 2

CH=C(CH3)2: 1 +6=7

So total C-H bonds = 7+2+1+2+7=19.

Wait, is that correct? Let me add again:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 7
- CH2: 2 → total 9
- CH(CH3): 1 → 10
- CH2: 2 → 12
- CH=C(CH3)2:7 → 19.

Wait, but wait, each CH3 group contributes three C-H bonds. Let's recount.

In (CH3)2C=CH-: each CH3 has 3 C-H, so 2 *3=6. The CH has 1, so 7.

CH2 has 2 → 9.

CH(CH3): the CH has 1, and the CH3 attached to it has 3 → total 4? Wait no, in CH(CH3), the CH is a single CH (1 C-H), and the CH3 is a group attached to that C. So, that CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds. So, the CH(CH3) group contributes 1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) =4 C-H bonds.

Wait, but in the molecule, the part is "-CH(CH3)-". So, the C in CH(CH3) has two single bonds: one to the adjacent CH2 group, one to the CH3 group, and one to the next CH2 group. So, yes, that C has one H attached (as CH). So, that's one C-H bond, and the attached CH3 has three C-H bonds. So total 4 C-H bonds in this part.

So, let's recount:

(CH3)2C=CH-: 7 → 7.

CH2-: 2 → 9.

CH(CH3)-: 4 →13.

CH2-: 2 →15.

CH=C(CH3)2: CH part →1, and each CH3 in C(CH3)2 →3 each, so 2 *3=6. So 1+6=7 →15 +7=22.

Wait, but that's 22 C-H bonds. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, let me recount:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has two CH3 groups, each with 3 C-H → 6. The CH has 1 → total 7.

Then, the first CH2 after the double bond: 2 C-H.

Then, CH(CH3): 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) →4.

Next CH2: 2.

Then, the CH in CH=C: 1.

The C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups, each with 3 →6.

So 1+6=7.

So adding all: 7 +2 =9, +4=13, +2=15, +7=22.

So 22 C-H bonds.

Wait, but the molecule's formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each CH3 contributes 3 C-H bonds, and each CH2 contributes 2, each CH contributes 1.

Now, moving on to C-C bonds.

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

So, let's count each single bond.

Each (CH3)2C= is connected via a double bond, so no C-C there. But the C in (CH3)2C is connected to each CH3 via a C-C bond, so two C-C bonds.

Then, the (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH. So, the CH is connected via a single bond to the next CH2. So that's a C-C bond.

Then, the CH2 is connected to the next CH(CH3) via a C-C bond.

The CH(CH3) is connected to the next CH2 via a C-C bond.

The CH2 is connected to the next CH via a C-C bond.

The CH is connected via a double bond to the C in C(CH3)2. So, the double bond is C=C.

Then, the C(CH3)2 is connected via C-C bonds to any adjacent groups? Wait, no, in the structure, it's the end. So perhaps the C in C(CH3)2 is connected via single bonds to the two CH3 groups and via a double bond to the CH group.

So, the C-C bonds are:

- In (CH3)2C: two C-C bonds (each CH3 connected to the central C).

- Between CH and CH2: one C-C.

- Between CH2 and CH(CH3): one C-C.

- Between CH(CH3) and CH2: one C-C.

- Between CH2 and CH: one C-C.

So, that's 2 +1 +1 +1 +1 =6 C-C bonds.

Wait, but let me go through each part:

1. (CH3)2C: central C connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

2. The (CH3)2C is connected via a double bond to CH, so no C-C there.

3. The CH is connected via a single bond to the next CH2 → one C-C.

4. The CH2 is connected to the next CH(CH3) → one C-C.

5. The CH(CH3) is connected to the next CH2 → one C-C.

6. The CH2 is connected to the next CH → one C-C.

7. The CH is connected via a double bond to the central C in C(CH3)2 → no C-C, but a C=C.

8. The C(CH3)2 is connected to two CH3 groups, each via a single C-C bond → two C-C bonds.

Wait, that would add more C-C bonds.

Wait, the C in C(CH3)2 is connected to two CH3 groups, which are themselves connected via C-C bonds. So each CH3 group attached to the central C has a C-C bond.

So, the C(CH3)2 part has two C-C bonds (each CH3 connected to the central C).

So, adding that:

So, the total C-C bonds would be:

- 2 (from (CH3)2C) +1 (CH-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH(CH3)) +1 (CH(CH3)-CH2) +1 (CH2-CH) +2 (from C(CH3)2) → 2+1+1+1+1+2=8.

Wait, that makes 8 C-C bonds.

Wait, let me recount:

1. (CH3)2C: 2 C-C bonds.

2. CH connected to CH2: 1.

3. CH2 connected to CH(CH3): 1.

4. CH(CH3) connected to CH2: 1.

5. CH2 connected to CH: 1.

6. C(CH3)2: 2.

Total: 2+1+1+1+1+2 = 8.

So 8 C-C bonds.

Now, the C=C bonds.

Looking at the molecule, I see two double bonds.

In (CH3)2C=CH- and CH=C(CH3)2.

Each is a double bond, so two C=C bonds.

So, 2 C=C bonds.

So now, what's the sum of bond energies for the molecule?

Each C-C bond contributes +200 kJ/mol, but since they are being counted as bonds in the molecule, each C-C bond in the product contributes to the energy released when formed. So, in the calculation, we'll sum the bond energies of the product bonds.

Wait, the formula for the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = sum (bond energies of reactant bonds broken) - sum (bond energies of product bonds formed)

Wait, but in this case, the reactants are the elements in their standard states: C and H2.

So, the bond energies of reactant bonds are the bonds in the elements. For C, the bond is a C-C bond (in graphite, but perhaps it's taken as the bond energy given, which is 200 kJ/mol). But wait, wait. The bond energy given is for C-C single bond. So, each C in graphite is bonded with three other C atoms, but the bond energy given is for a single bond.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) to form gaseous atoms, and then the energy released when the product bonds form.

So, the process is:

1. Break the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) into gaseous atoms. This requires energy.

2. Form bonds in the product molecule. This releases energy.

The enthalpy of formation is the net energy (energy in - energy out).

So, the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactant bonds) ] - [Σ (bond energies of product bonds) ]

But wait, for the reactants, the bonds to break are the C-C bonds in graphite (but perhaps for carbon, since it's in its standard state as graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous.

Similarly, H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, so each H-H bond requires 100 kJ/mol to break.

So, for the reactants (C and H2), the total bond energy to break is:

Number of C atoms * (enthalpy of atomization per C) + Number of H2 molecules * (H-H bond energy).

Wait, but the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's find out how many C and H atoms are in the molecule.

Each molecule has:

- Each (CH3)2C group: 3 C and 6 H (since 2 CH3 groups contribute 2*3=6 H).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the molecular formula.

Looking at the formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C and H.

Each (CH3) group is CH3: 3 H.

In (CH3)2C=CH-: 

- (CH3)2C has 2 CH3 → 2*3=6 H.

- The =CH- is CH2 (since it's CH2 connected via double bond?), but perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each (CH3)2C=CH- group contributes 3 C and 7 H.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count each atom:

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is a CH3 group. So, let's count C and H.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 

- 2 CH3 → 2*(1 C +3 H) = 2 C +6 H.

- The central C: 1 C.

- The =CH-: 1 C connected via double bond, and 1 H.

So, in this group: 2+1+1=4 C, and 6 +1=7 H.

2. Then, -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-:

- -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.

- -CH(CH3)-: 1 C, 1 H (since CH has one H) +3 H (from CH3) → but wait, no. The CH(CH3) group has the central C connected to one H, one CH2 group, and one CH3 group. So, the H is only one.

So, CH(CH3) contributes 1 C, 1 H.

- -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.

3. Then, -CH=C(CH3)2:

- CH: 1 C, 1 H.

- C=C: the central C is connected to two CH3 groups. Each CH3 contributes 3 H.

So, C(CH3)2 contributes 2 C and 2*(3 H) =6 H.

Putting it all together:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 4 C, 7 H.

- -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-: three parts:

   - CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

   - CH(CH3): 1 C, 1 H.

   - CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

   So, total 3 C, 5 H.

- -CH=C(CH3)2: 3 C (1 from CH, 2 from C(CH3)2) → wait, no. 

Wait, CH=C(CH3)2 has:

- CH: 1 C, 1 H.

- C=C: the central C is connected to the CH and two CH3 groups.

So, the central C (from C=C) is connected to CH and two CH3.

So, the C in CH is 1 C, and the C in C=C is 1 C, and each CH3 is 1 C, so total for this group is 1 +1 +2*1=4 C.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach it differently.

The molecule seems to have 12 carbons in total.

But perhaps another approach is better.

Each (CH3) group contributes one C and three H. So, in the entire molecule, each (CH3) is present in several places.

Let me count the number of (CH3) groups:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 2.

- CH(CH3): 1.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 2.

So, that's 2 +1 +2 =5 CH3 groups. Each contributes 3 H, so 5 *3=15 H from CH3.

Additionally, there are H's in other parts like CH2 and CH.

Let me list all the H's:

- In (CH3)2C=CH-: 7 H (as counted earlier).

- In CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH= group: 2 (from first CH2) +1 (from CH) +2 (from second CH2) →5 H.

- In CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (from CH) +6 (from two CH3) →7 H.

So total H is 7 +5 +7 =19 H. So, each molecule has 19 H atoms.

Wait, but earlier I thought the C-H bonds are 22, but each H atom contributes one bond. So, 19 H atoms →19 C-H bonds? Wait, no, because each C can have multiple H's.

Wait, no, each H is bonded to a C. So, the number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of H atoms, which is 19.

But earlier, I thought there were 22 C-H bonds. Hmm, that's a contradiction. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, perhaps earlier I counted the C-H bonds as 22, but that's incorrect. Let me recount.

Each H atom is part of a C-H bond, so the number of C-H bonds is equal to the number of H atoms in the molecule.

So, if the molecule has 19 H atoms, then there are 19 C-H bonds.

But earlier, I thought I had 22 C-H bonds. That suggests I made a mistake in counting.

So, perhaps I should recount the H's.

Let me go through the molecule again:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3) group: 3 H.

In (CH3)2C=CH-:

- Each CH3 contributes 3 H → 2*3=6.

- The CH (from =CH-) has 1 H.

So, 6 +1=7 H.

Then, the next parts:

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH(CH3): 1 H (the CH part) +3 H (from CH3) →4 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2: CH has 1 H, and each CH3 has 3 H →2*3=6. So, 1 +6=7 H.

Adding all H's: 7 (from first part) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (CH=C...) = 7+2=9; 9+4=13; 13+2=15; 15+7=22 H atoms. Wait, that's 22 H atoms.

But earlier, when I thought about the structure, I thought each H is part of a C-H bond, so the number of C-H bonds equals the number of H atoms, which would be 22.

So, 22 C-H bonds.

So, the H's are 22.

But earlier, when I thought about the total valence electrons, perhaps I should check that.

Wait, the molecule has:

Number of C atoms: let's count.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- has 3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 C (from =CH-) →4 C.

Then, CH2 adds 1 C.

CH(CH3) adds 1 C.

CH2 adds another 1 C.

CH adds another 1 C.

C in C(CH3)2 adds 1 C.

Wait, but that's 4 (first group) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH) +1 (C in C(CH3)2) → 9 C. But that can't be right because each (CH3)2C=CH- is three C's plus one from CH, etc.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write the formula in a way that each carbon is counted:

The formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So, each group:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 C (from CH) →4 C.

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH(CH3): 1 C.

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH: 1 C.

- C(CH3)2: 1 C.

So, total C: 4 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =9 C.

Wait, but that's only 9 C. But the formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let's consider each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (from (CH3)2C) and 1 C (from =CH-).

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH(CH3): 1 C.

- CH2: 1 C.

- CH: 1 C.

- C(CH3)2: 1 C.

Adding up: 3+1 +1+1+1+1=8 C.

Wait, perhaps I missed one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula has 12 C as I thought earlier. But perhaps the correct way is to note that the formula has 12 C and 22 H.

So, 12 C and 22 H.

So, each molecule has 12 C and 22 H atoms.

So, the bond energies for the product (the molecule) are:

- Number of C-C bonds: 8 →8 *200 kJ/mol = 1600 kJ/mol.

- Number of C=C bonds: 2 →2 *300=600 kJ/mol.

- Number of C-H bonds:22 →22 *400=8800 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. The bond energies are in kJ/mol, so each bond contributes, and the total is the sum.

But wait, in the formation reaction, the bonds in the reactants (C and H2) are broken, and the bonds in the product are formed.

So, the reactants are:

12 C atoms (each as C in graphite) and (22 H atoms) which come from H2 molecules. So, each H2 molecule has 2 H atoms, so number of H2 molecules is 22/2=11.

So, the bonds to break are:

- C atoms: each C in graphite is bonded to three others, but the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol per C atom. So, for 12 C atoms, the energy to break into gaseous C atoms is 12 *1000 =12,000 kJ/mol.

- H2 molecules: each H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. There are 11 H2 molecules (since 22 H atoms →11 H2 molecules). So, bond energy is 11 *100=1100 kJ/mol.

So, total energy to break reactant bonds: 12,000 +1100=13,100 kJ/mol.

Now, the bonds formed in the product are:

C-C bonds:8 →8 *200=1600.

C=C bonds:2 →2 *300=600.

C-H bonds:22 →22 *400=8800.

Total bonds formed:1600+600+8800=11,000 kJ/mol.

So, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break reactants (13,100) minus the energy released when forming products (11,000).

ΔHf = 13,100 -11,000 =2,100 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me double-check the math:

13,100 -11,000 =2,100 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, option A is 11,200 kJ/mol, which doesn't match. Option B is 67.4, which is way lower. Option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is specific and low. Option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is also specific and high.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of C-C bonds.

Earlier, I had 8 C-C bonds. Let me recount.

Number of C-C bonds:

Each single bond between two carbons.

Looking at the structure:

1. (CH3)2C: two C-C bonds (each CH3 attached to central C).

2. (CH3)2C connected to CH via double bond, so no C-C there.

3. CH connected to CH2 →1 C-C.

4. CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

5. CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

6. CH2 connected to CH →1.

7. CH connected to C in C(CH3)2 via double bond → no C-C.

8. C in C(CH3)2 connected to two CH3 groups →2 C-C bonds.

So, that's 8 C-C bonds.

So, 8 *200=1600.

The C=C bonds:2 →2*300=600.

C-H bonds:22 →22*400=8800.

Total product bonds:1600+600+8800=11,000.

Reactant bonds:

12 C atoms →12 *1000=12,000.

H2 →11 H2 →11 *100=1100.

Total reactant bonds:13,100.

ΔHf=13,100-11,000=2,100 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I miscounted the number of H atoms.

Wait, the molecule has 22 H atoms, so 11 H2 molecules, each contributing a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol. So 11 *100=1100.

So, that part is correct.

Another possibility is that I miscounted the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, let me recount the C-C bonds.

- (CH3)2C: 2 C-C.

- CH-CH2:1.

- CH2-CH(CH3):1.

- CH(CH3)-CH2:1.

- CH2-CH:1.

- C(CH3)2:2 C-C.

So, 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 → correct.

Hmm. So the calculation leads to 2,100 kJ/mol, but none of the options match. The options are 11,200; 67.4; 11.44; 1900.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the bond energies.

Wait, the problem states the bond energies:

Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.

So, each C atom in graphite requires 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous. So, 12 C atoms →12,000.

H-H bond energy is 100 kJ/mol, so each H2 molecule requires 100 kJ to break.

So, 11 H2 →1100.

Product bonds: 8 C-C (1600), 2 C=C (600), 22 C-H (8800). Total 11,000.

So, ΔHf=13,100 -11,000 =2,100 kJ/mol.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. Maybe the molecule has more.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond energies are in kJ per bond, not per mole.

Wait, the question gives bond energies as:

Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol.

So, each H-H bond contributes 100 kJ/mol per mole of H2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of per mole of molecule. Since the problem is about the formation of 1 mole of the molecule, the calculation is per mole.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the number of bonds.

Wait, another approach: let's calculate the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

Number of C-C single bonds: Each C-C bond is a single bond.

In the molecule:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- part contributes two C-C bonds (between the central C and each CH3).

Then, the CH is connected via a single bond to the next CH2 →1.

The CH2 is connected to CH(CH3) →1.

The CH(CH3) is connected to next CH2 →1.

The CH2 is connected to CH →1.

The CH is connected via a double bond to the C in C(CH3)2 → no C-C.

The C in C(CH3)2 is connected to two CH3 groups →2.

So, 2 +1+1+1+1 +2 =8 C-C bonds.

So, 8 is correct.

Number of C=C bonds:2.

Number of C-H bonds:22.

So, 8*200=1600, 2*300=600, 22*400=8800. Sum=11,000.

Reactants: 12,000 (C) +1100 (H2) →13,100.

ΔHf=13,100-11,000=2,100 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match this.

Looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in gaseous form, but the question doesn't specify whether the formation is from graphite and H2 gas, which it should be.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I miscounted the number of C atoms.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C atoms step by step.

Each (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 (from CH) →4 C.

CH2:1.

CH(CH3):1.

CH2:1.

CH:1.

C in C(CH3)2:1.

So, 4+1+1+1+1+1=9 C. So, the molecule has 9 C atoms.

Ah! I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I thought the molecule has 12 C, but upon recounting, it's 9 C.

So, number of C atoms:9.

H atoms: as before, 22.

So, the bonds in reactants:

C:9 →9 *1000=9,000.

H2:22/2=11 →11 *100=1,100.

Total reactant bonds: 9,000 +1,100=10,100 kJ/mol.

Product bonds:

C-C:8 →8 *200=1,600.

C=C:2 →2*300=600.

C-H:22 →22 *400=8,800.

Total product bonds:1,600+600+8,800=11,000.

So, ΔHf=10,100 -11,000= -900 kJ/mol.

But that's negative, and the options don't have negative numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, the formula is:

ΔHf = sum of bond energies of reactants (broken) - sum of bond energies of products (formed).

So, if the product bonds are stronger (lower energy), the sum would be positive.

Wait, in this case, 10,100 (reactants) -11,000 (products) = -900.

Which would be exothermic. But none of the options have negative values.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recount the C's.

Wait, the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a CH3.

Let me write the entire structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- →3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 C (from CH) →4 C.

2. CH2 →1 C.

3. CH(CH3) →1 C.

4. CH2 →1 C.

5. CH →1 C.

6. C(CH3)2 →1 C.

So, 4 +1+1+1+1+1=9 C.

So, 9 C, 22 H.

So, reactant bonds:

9 C →9 *1000=9,000.

22 H →11 H2 →11 *100=1,100.

Total reactant bonds broken:10,100.

Product bonds formed:

8 C-C →8 *200=1,600.

2 C=C →2 *300=600.

22 C-H →22 *400=8,800.

Total product bonds:1,600 +600 +8,800=11,000.

ΔHf = 10,100 -11,000 = -900 kJ/mol.

But this is not matching any options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the bond counts or in the structure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has more C-C bonds. Let me recount:

After the (CH3)2C=CH- group:

- CH is connected to CH2 →1 C-C.

- CH2 connected to CH(CH3) →1.

- CH(CH3) connected to CH2 →1.

- CH2 connected to CH →1.

- CH connected to C in C(CH3)2 → no C-C (double bond).

- C in C(CH3)2 connected to two CH3 groups →2 C-C.

So, 2 (from (CH3)2C) +1 +1 +1 +1 +2=8. Correct.

Hmm. So the calculation leads to -900 kJ/mol, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me re-express the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to count the number of each type of bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the formula:

ΔHf = (sum of (bond energies of elements)) - (sum of bond energies of the molecule)

But for the elements, each C-C bond in graphite has a bond energy of 200 kJ/mol, but the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.

So, perhaps the correct calculation is:

Enthalpy of formation = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization) + (number of H2 molecules × H-H bond energy) ] - [ (number of C-C bonds × bond energy) + (number of C=C bonds × bond energy) + (number of C-H bonds × bond energy) ]

So, using the correct numbers:

Number of C atoms =9.

Number of H2 molecules=11.

So,

Reactant bonds: 9×1000 +11×100 =9,000 +1,100 =10,100.

Product bonds:8×200 +2×300 +22×400=1,600 +600 +8,800=11,000.

ΔHf=10,100 -11,000= -900.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is not in its standard state, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the molecule, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to calculate the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I counted the H atoms. Let me recount the H's.

Molecule: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the H's in each group:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

   Each CH3 has 3 H →2×3=6.

   The CH has 1 H.

   Total:7.

2. CH2-:

   2 H.

3. CH(CH3)-:

   CH has 1 H.

   CH3 has 3 H.

   Total:4.

4. CH2-:

   2 H.

5. CH-:

   1 H.

6. C(CH3)2:

   Each CH3 has 3 H →2×3=6.

   So, 6 H.

Adding up:7 +2 +4 +2 +1 +6=22 H.

So, 22 H atoms.

So, the product bonds are:

C-C:8 →1600.

C=C:2→600.

C-H:22→8800.

Total product bonds:11,000.

So, ΔHf=10,100-11,000= -900.

Hmm, this is perplexing.

Looking back at the options, the only one close to 11,000 is option A:11,200.

But our calculation shows 11,000 for the product bonds. So perhaps the given option is 11,200, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I missed some bonds.

Wait, perhaps I missed a C-C bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 9 C atoms, and each C has four bonds, so:

Each C has four bonds, so total bonds are (9×4)/2=18.

But wait, in the molecule, the bonds are:

C-C:8 →8 bonds.

C=C:2 →2 bonds.

C-H:22 →22 bonds.

Total bonds:8+2+22=32.

Wait, but each C can have four bonds.

Wait, 9 C atoms ×4 =36 bonds.

But since each bond connects two atoms, the total actual bonds would be 36/2=18 bonds.

But according to our count, the product bonds are 8+2+22=32 bonds. That's not correct because it exceeds 18.

Wait, this suggests that our count of bonds is way off. Because with 9 C atoms, the total bonds can't exceed (9×4)/2=18.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to recount the number of bonds in the molecule.

Each C can form four bonds.

Let me try to count the number of each type of bond correctly.

Given the structure: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

I'll number the carbons from left to right as C1 to C9.

C1: connected to two CH3 groups and C2 via double bond.

C2: connected to C1 via double bond, and to C3.

C3: connected to C2, C4, and two H's.

C4: connected to C3, C5, and two H's.

C5: connected to C4, C6, and a CH3 group.

C6: connected to C5, C7, and two H's.

C7: connected to C6, C8 via double bond, and one H.

C8: connected to C7 via double bond, and two CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps this is a better way to count the bonds.

So, each C has four bonds.

C1: (CH3)2-C=CH-

C1 is connected to two CH3 groups (2 C-C bonds), and a double bond to C2 (counts as 1 bond, but it's a double bond, so contributes 2 bonds? No, in terms of bonds, each C=C is a single bond but with double bond energy.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to count the number of each type of bond present.

But perhaps it's better to abandon this approach and consider that maybe the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol.

But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to calculate the enthalpy of atomization, not the formation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of H2 molecules. If the molecule has 22 H atoms, it requires 11 H2 molecules. So, 11×100=1,100.

But perhaps the H-H bond energy is 100 per H2, which is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break C-C bonds in graphite to get gaseous C atoms. So, the bond energy for C-C in graphite is 200 kJ/mol, but the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ/mol per C atom.

So, each C atom requires 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous, regardless of its bonding in the solid.

So, for 9 C atoms, it's 9×1000=9,000.

So, the initial approach is correct.

But even then, the calculation gives ΔHf= -900 kJ/mol, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the correct answer isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 11,200 kJ/mol. Which is close to the sum of the product bonds (11,000). But why would the enthalpy of formation be positive and that high?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy to break the molecule into atoms, not the reverse. So, perhaps I should subtract the way around.

Wait, if the formula is ΔHf = sum of product bonds - sum of reactant bonds.

But that would give 11,000 -10,100=900 kJ/mol.

But then, the enthalpy of formation would be positive 900, which is also not an option.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, not the formation.

The enthalpy of atomization would be the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule into atoms. So, that would be sum of product bonds.

Which is 11,000 kJ/mol. But the option A is 11,200, which is close.

But the question specifically asks for the enthalpy of formation, not atomization.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I missed a C-C bond. Let me recount.

In the structure:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: C1 connected to two CH3 →2 C-C.

- C2 connected to C1 via double bond (no C-C), and to C3 →1 C-C.

- C3 connected to C2, C4 →1 C-C.

- C4 connected to C3, C5 →1 C-C.

- C5 connected to C4, C6 →1 C-C.

- C6 connected to C5, C7 →1 C-C.

- C7 connected to C6, C8 via double bond → no C-C.

- C8 connected to C7 via double bond (no C-C), and to two CH3 →2 C-C.

So, 2+1+1+1+1+1+2=9 C-C bonds.

Wait, that's 9 C-C bonds.

Ah! So earlier count was incorrect. The correct number is 9 C-C bonds.

So, C-C bonds:9 →9 ×200=1,800.

C=C bonds:2 →2 ×300=600.

C-H bonds:22 →22 ×400=8,800.

Total product bonds:1,800 +600 +8,800=11,200.

Now, the reactant bonds:

C:9 ×1000=9,000.

H:11 ×100=1,100.

Total reactant bonds:10,100.

So, ΔHf=10,100 -11,200= -1,100 kJ/mol.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but wait: the product bonds sum to 11,200, which is option A.

But the calculation gives ΔHf= -1,100.

Hmm, perhaps the question is actually asking for the enthalpy of atomization of the molecule, which is 11,200 kJ/mol, matching option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the product minus the sum of the reactants. So,

ΔHf= sum (product bonds) - sum (reactant bonds).

Which would be 11,200 -10,100=1,100 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the sum of the bond energies of the molecule, which is 11,200 kJ/mol, as option A.

But the question asks for the enthalpy of formation, not the atomization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds, and not the H-H bonds because the molecule doesn't contain H-H bonds.

Wait, but in the reactants, we have H2 molecules, which have H-H bonds.

So, perhaps the option A is 11,200 kJ/mol, which is the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds.

But the correct calculation for enthalpy of formation is 10,100 -11,200= -1,100.

But again, this isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem made a mistake, and the correct answer is not listed. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the C-C bonds.

Wait, with 9 C-C bonds, the sum is 1,800. Then product bonds sum to 1,800+600+8,800=11,200.

If the question asks for the bond energy content of the molecule, then option A is correct.

But the question specifically asks for the enthalpy of formation, which is the energy change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C atoms. Let me recount.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) group is a substituent.

Let me count each C:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C (from (CH3)2C) +1 C (from CH) →4.

2. CH2: 1 C.

3. CH(CH3):1 C.

4. CH2:1 C.

5. CH:1 C.

6. C(CH3)2:1 C.

Total:4+1+1+1+1+1=9 C.

So, 9 C.

So, the product bonds sum to 11,200, but the formation is -1,100, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy of formation as the sum of bond energies of the product, not considering the reactants. So, 11,200 kJ/mol, which is option A.

But that's not the correct approach for enthalpy of formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B:67.4.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. If the molecule has 5 C-C bonds, for example.

But I'm not seeing where.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has 6 C-C bonds.

Wait, perhaps I should try the calculation again with 9 C-C bonds.

So, product bonds:9*200=1,800.

C=C:2*300=600.

C-H:22*400=8,800.

Sum:1,800+600+8,800=11,200.

Reactant bonds:

9*1000=9,000.

11*100=1,100.

Total reactant bonds=10,100.

ΔHf=10,100 -11,200= -1,100.

But none of the options match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the average bond energy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the formula is being considered as 1 mole of the molecule, but the calculation is per gram, not per mole.

Wait, the options C and D are per gram.

If the molecular weight is, say, 144 g/mol, then 67.4 kJ/mol would be 67.4/144 ≈0.468 kJ/g.

But option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which is much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation per gram.

Wait, molecular weight is 9 C (12*9=108) +22 H (1*22=22) →130 g/mol.

So, 130 g is 1 mol.

If the enthalpy of formation is 11,200 kJ/mol, then per gram it's 11,200 /130 ≈86.15 kJ/g. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, if it's -1,100 kJ/mol, per gram it's -1,100 /130≈-8.46 kJ/g. Still not matching.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps the correct answer is option A:11,200 kJ/mol, as it matches the sum of the product bonds.

But I'm not certain. Since none of the other options make sense, perhaps the intended answer is A.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were taken:

### Key Information and Assumptions:
1. **Bond Energies**:
   - C-C: 200 kJ/mol
   - C=C: 300 kJ/mol
   - C-H: 400 kJ/mol
   - H-H: 100 kJ/mol
   - Enthalpy of atomization of carbon: 1000 kJ/mol

2. **Structure Analysis**:
   - The molecule contains **9 carbon atoms** and **22 hydrogen atoms**.
   - **C-C bonds**: 9 (each contributing 200 kJ/mol).
   - **C=C bonds**: 2 (each contributing 300 kJ/mol).
   - **C-H bonds**: 22 (each contributing 400 kJ/mol).

3. **Reactants**:
   - Carbon (C): 9 atoms, each requiring 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous.
   - Hydrogen (H₂): 11 molecules (since 22 H atoms are present), each requiring 100 kJ/mol to break the H-H bond.

4. **Enthalpy of Formation Formula**:
   - ΔHf° = (Sum of bond energies of reactants) - (Sum of bond energies of products).

### Calculations:
1. **Reactant Bonds**:
   - Carbon: \( 9 \times 1000 = 9000 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - Hydrogen: \( 11 \times 100 = 1100 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - Total reactant bonds: \( 9000 + 1100 = 10100 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

2. **Product Bonds**:
   - C-C bonds: \( 9 \times 200 = 1800 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - C=C bonds: \( 2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - C-H bonds: \( 22 \times 400 = 8800 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).
   - Total product bonds: \( 1800 + 600 + 8800 = 11200 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

3. **Enthalpy of Formation**:
   - \( \Delta H_f^\circ = 10100 - 11200 = -1100 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**: This matches the total bond energy of the product bonds but does not represent the enthalpy of formation, which is the net energy change.
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This value does not align with any intermediate or final calculation.
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)**: This appears to be a per-gram value, but the calculations do not support this number.
- **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: Similarly, this per-gram value is inconsistent with the calculations.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible answer based on the calculations is **Option A (11200 kJ/mol)**, as it corresponds to the total bond energy of the product bonds, even though it does not represent the enthalpy of formation. None of the other options align with the derived values.

**Answer: A**
