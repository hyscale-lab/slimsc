Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. They're asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so both frames are inertial. That probably means I can use special relativity here, or maybe just classical mechanics? Hmm. Since the speed is quite high—60,000 km/s—I should think about relativistic effects. Oh wait, 60,000 km/s is 0.06c, since c is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 2% of c. Hmm, maybe relativistic effects are significant enough that we can't ignore them, but perhaps the problem expects a classical approach. Or maybe the problem is designed to use a simple approach.

Wait, but the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. So that involves time dilation, perhaps. Because time intervals differ between frames.

So, I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Let me think about the frames. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

But when the ejecta's clock measures 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because due to time dilation, the time intervals may differ.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think about the scenario.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in that frame, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is approaching. From the ejecta's perspective, 50 seconds pass. In that time, how far would the ejecta have moved according to the Galaxy?

Wait, no. Wait, the question is: in the Galaxy's frame, what distance does the ejecta travel when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So, in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds have passed. But during that time, due to time dilation, the Galaxy's clock would have measured a different amount of time. So we need to find out how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame has measured 50 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame, and we need to find how much distance it covers in 50 seconds as per the Galaxy's time. But that would be straightforward: distance = speed * time. But wait, that's only if the time is measured in the same frame. But the question says, time passes in the ejecta's frame, so we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, then use that to calculate the distance.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem is about the relationship between the two frames. So, in the ejecta frame, the time is 50 seconds. What is the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame? Because due to relativity, moving clocks run slower. So if the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, the time measured in the Galaxy would be longer than 50 seconds, because the ejecta's clock is moving and thus runs slower.

Wait, but wait. The direction is important. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So we have two frames: S is the Galaxy, and S' is the ejecta.

In S', the velocity of S is u = 60,000 km/s (since the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, which is at rest in S'). So in S, the ejecta (S') is moving at u = 60,000 km/s.

Now, in S', a time t' = 50 seconds passes. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S's frame during that time. But wait, wait: in S's frame, the ejecta is moving at u, so the distance would be u * t, where t is the time in S's frame.

So we need to find t in S's frame corresponding to t' =50 s in S'.

But how do we find t in S when t' is in S'?

Wait, no, actually, the time in each frame is not directly related because the events are moving. Wait, perhaps we need to think about the time in S and S' and how they relate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering time dilation, and it's expecting a simple solution using relative velocity. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but let's think about the problem again. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in their frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them. The time they experience is 50 seconds. So in that time, how much distance has the ejecta traveled in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as: "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the distance the ejecta travels is speed multiplied by time. But what is the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame shows 50 seconds?

So we need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's time is 50 seconds. Because time dilation comes into play here.

So, the time in S (Galaxy's frame) is longer than the time in S' (ejecta's frame).

Wait, let me think about time dilation formula. The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, in this case, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute gamma.

First, compute v in km/s: 60,000 km/s.

c is approximately 300,000 km/s.

So, v = 60,000 = 0.2 c.

So, (v/c) = 0.2.

v²/c² = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So, gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused about which frame is which. Because the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

But according to special relativity, each frame sees the other as moving at the same speed. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards them.

So, in the ejecta's frame, time is t' = 50 seconds. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t'.

Wait, no. Wait, the time dilation formula says that a moving clock runs slower. So the clock in S' (ejecta) will run slower as seen from S (Galaxy). So from the perspective of the Galaxy, the ejecta's clock is running slow. So, if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame?

I think that's the correct way: t (in S) = gamma * t' (in S').

Wait, no. Because when an observer in S (Galaxy) sees S' (ejecta) moving at velocity v, the time in S' is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma. So t = gamma * t'.

Yes. So, in this case, t = gamma * t'.

So, gamma is 1.0206, as above.

So, t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is approximately 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in this time is speed * time.

Speed is 60,000 km/s.

So, distance = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ ?

Calculate that: 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.

Total: 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's close.

But wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me redo the gamma calculation.

v = 60,000 km/s.

v²/c² = (60,000)^2 / (300,000)^2 = (6e4)^2 / (3e5)^2 = (36e8)/(9e10) )= 36e8 / 9e10 = (36/9) * 1e-2 = 4 * 0.01 = 0.04.

So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

What's sqrt(0.96) exactly? Let's compute it more precisely.

0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25.

sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.979796.

So 1/0.979796 ≈ 1.02062.

So, gamma ≈ 1.02062.

So, t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.02062 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

So, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s = 60,000 *51.031 = ?

50 s gives 3,000,000 km.

1.031 s gives 60,000 * 1.031 = 61,860 km.

So total is 3,061,860 km.

But the options are:

A) 2,940,000

B) 3,000,000

C) 2,880,000

D) 3,060,000

So, 3,061,860 is closest to option D, which is 3,060,000. So D is the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe the problem is expecting a non-relativistic approach, as sometimes in exams, they might not require you to consider relativity for 60,000 km/s. Let's see, using the non-relativistic approach, time in Galaxy's frame is same as ejecta's frame because there's no time dilation.

No, that's not correct because the problem says both are inertial frames, so time dilation must be considered.

Wait, but wait. Another perspective: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the time in their frame is 50 seconds. What's the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them. So the distance the ejecta would cover in the Galaxy's frame is, well, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the simple Galilean transformation, without considering relativity. So, the time in both frames is the same, t = t'=50 s.

So, distance in Galaxy frame is speed * time: 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But wait, that's a big discrepancy because it's a factor of gamma. So, which approach is correct?

The question states that both are inertial frames, so special relativity applies. So, the time in the two frames will differ, leading to the distance being longer than 3,000,000 km.

But wait, the question says, the ejecta travels a certain distance in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, no, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, they are at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards them. So, from their perspective, the time is 50 seconds, and the distance the Galaxy would have moved towards them is 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. But that's from the ejecta's perspective; but the question is about the ejecta moving in the Galaxy's frame.

Hmm, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance the ejecta travels in time t (Galaxy's frame) is 60,000 * t.

But t is the time in Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

So, using time dilation, t = gamma * t'.

So, t' =50 s.

Gamma is approx 1.0206, so t ≈51.03 s.

Distance = 60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km.

Which is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km.

But why is the option exactly 3,060,000? Let me check if gamma is exactly 1.0206... Or maybe the problem expects us to calculate without considering relativity, but that would lead to option B.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the distance in the Galaxy's frame. The problem states that the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center. So, the distance it covers in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But how to find t in the Galaxy's frame when t' is 50 s in the ejecta's frame.

In the ejecta's frame, they are stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s.

But in the ejecta's frame, the time between two events (like the start and end of the 50-second period) is t' =50 s. The same events would be seen in the Galaxy's frame as occurring over a longer time, t = gamma * t'.

So, yes, t=50 * gamma.

Thus, the distance is 60,000 * (50 * gamma).

So, 60,000 *50 * gamma = 3,000,000 * gamma.

Gamma is approximately 1.0206, so 3,000,000 *1.0206 ≈3,061,800 km.

So, the answer is about 3,061,800 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km as per option D.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame and account for relativistic effects due to the high velocity of 60,000 km/s (approximately 2% of the speed of light). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Relative Motion and Time Dilation**:  
   In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. Conversely, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed. Due to special relativity, time dilation occurs because the ejecta's clock (in its frame) runs slower compared to the Galaxy's clock. The relationship between the time intervals in the two frames is given by the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t'
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \), \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \).  

2. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \left(\frac{60,000}{300,000}\right)^2 = 0.04
   \]  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  

3. **Relate Time Intervals**:  
   In the ejecta's frame, \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \). Using the time dilation formula, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t' = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]  

4. **Calculate Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]  

5. **Compare with Options**:  
   The calculated distance \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \) is closest to option \( D \), which is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

But when the ejecta's clock measures 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Because due to time dilation, the time intervals may differ.

So we need to find out how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame has measured 50 seconds.

But that would be straightforward: distance = speed * time. But wait, that's only if the time is measured in the same frame. But the question says, time passes in the ejecta's frame, so we need to find the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame, then use that to calculate the distance.

Wait, let's clarify. The problem is about the relationship between the two frames. So, in the ejecta frame, the time is 50 seconds. What is the corresponding time in the Galaxy's frame? Because due to relativity, moving clocks run slower. So if the ejecta is moving relative to the Galaxy, the time measured in the Galaxy would be longer than 50 seconds, because the ejecta's clock is moving and thus runs slower.

Wait, but wait. The direction is important. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So we have two frames: S is the Galaxy, and S' is the ejecta.

In S', the velocity of S is u = 60,000 km/s (since the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, which is at rest in S'). So in S, the ejecta (S') is moving at u = 60,000 km/s.

Now, in S', a time t' = 50 seconds passes. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S's frame during that time. But wait, wait: in S's frame, the ejecta is moving at u, so the distance would be u * t, where t is the time in S's frame.

So we need to find t in S's frame corresponding to t' =50 s in S'.

But how do we find t in S when t' is in S'?

Wait, no, actually, the time in each frame is not directly related because the events are moving. Wait, perhaps we need to think about the time in S and S' and how they relate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering time dilation, and it's expecting a simple solution using relative velocity. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but let's think about the problem again. From the reference frame of the ejecta, the center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in their frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them. The time they experience is 50 seconds. So in that time, how much distance has the ejecta traveled in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as: "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the distance the ejecta travels is speed multiplied by time. But what is the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame shows 50 seconds?

So we need to find the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's time is 50 seconds. Because time dilation comes into play here.

So, the time in S (Galaxy's frame) is longer than the time in S' (ejecta's frame).

Wait, let me think about time dilation formula. The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So, in this case, v is 60,000 km/s. Let me compute gamma.

First, compute v in km/s: 60,000 km/s.

c is approximately 300,000 km/s.

So, v = 60,000 = 0.2 c.

So, (v/c) = 0.2.

v²/c² = (0.2)^2 = 0.04.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So, gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused about which frame is which. Because the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

But according to special relativity, each frame sees the other as moving at the same speed. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards them.

So, in the ejecta's frame, time is t' = 50 seconds. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t'.

Wait, no. Wait, the time dilation formula says that a moving clock runs slower. So the clock in S' (ejecta) will run slower as seen from S (Galaxy). So from the perspective of the Galaxy, the ejecta's clock is running slow. So, if 50 seconds pass on the ejecta's clock, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame?

I think that's the correct way: t (in S) = gamma * t' (in S').

Wait, no. Because when an observer in S (Galaxy) sees S' (ejecta) moving at velocity v, the time in S' is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma. So t = gamma * t'.

Yes. So, in this case, t = gamma * t'.

So, gamma is 1.0206, as above.

So, t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So, the time in the Galaxy's frame is approximately 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in this time is speed * time.

Speed is 60,000 km/s.

So, distance = 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ ?

Calculate that: 60,000 * 50 = 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.

Total: 3,000,000 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. So that's close.

But wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me redo the gamma calculation.

v = 60,000 km/s.

v²/c² = (60,000)^2 / (300,000)^2 = (6e4)^2 / (3e5)^2 = (36e8)/(9e10) )= 36e8 / 9e10 = (36/9) * 1e-2 = 4 * 0.01 = 0.04.

So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

What's sqrt(0.96) exactly? Let's compute it more precisely.

0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25.

sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5 ≈ 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.979796.

So 1/0.979796 ≈ 1.02062.

So, gamma ≈ 1.02062.

So, t = gamma * t' = 50 * 1.02062 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

So, distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.031 s = 60,000 *51.031 = ?

50 s gives 3,000,000 km.

1.031 s gives 60,000 * 1.031 = 61,860 km.

So total is 3,061,860 km.

But the options are:

A) 2,940,000

B) 3,000,000

C) 2,880,000

D) 3,060,000

So, 3,061,860 is closest to option D, which is 3,060,000. So D is the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe the problem is expecting a non-relativistic approach, as sometimes in exams, they might not require you to consider relativity for 60,000 km/s. Let's see, using the non-relativistic approach, time in Galaxy's frame is same as ejecta's frame because there's no time dilation.

No, that's not correct because the problem says both are inertial frames, so time dilation must be considered.

Wait, but wait. Another perspective: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, the time in their frame is 50 seconds. What's the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them. So the distance the ejecta would cover in the Galaxy's frame is, well, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the simple Galilean transformation, without considering relativity. So, the time in both frames is the same, t = t'=50 s.

So, distance in Galaxy frame is speed * time: 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B.

But wait, that's a big discrepancy because it's a factor of gamma. So, which approach is correct?

The question states that both are inertial frames, so special relativity applies. So, the time in the two frames will differ, leading to the distance being longer than 3,000,000 km.

But wait, the question says, the ejecta travels a certain distance in the Galaxy frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, no, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.

Wait, but in the ejecta's frame, they are at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards them. So, from their perspective, the time is 50 seconds, and the distance the Galaxy would have moved towards them is 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km. But that's from the ejecta's perspective; but the question is about the ejecta moving in the Galaxy's frame.

Hmm, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance the ejecta travels in time t (Galaxy's frame) is 60,000 * t.

But t is the time in Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

So, using time dilation, t = gamma * t'.

So, t' =50 s.

Gamma is approx 1.0206, so t ≈51.03 s.

Distance = 60,000 *51.03 ≈3,061,800 km.

Which is closest to option D, 3,060,000 km.

But why is the option exactly 3,060,000? Let me check if gamma is exactly 1.0206... Or maybe the problem expects us to calculate without considering relativity, but that would lead to option B.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the distance in the Galaxy's frame. The problem states that the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galactic center. So, the distance it covers in the Galaxy's frame is 60,000 * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But how to find t in the Galaxy's frame when t' is 50 s in the ejecta's frame.

In the ejecta's frame, they are stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s.

But in the ejecta's frame, the time between two events (like the start and end of the 50-second period) is t' =50 s. The same events would be seen in the Galaxy's frame as occurring over a longer time, t = gamma * t'.

So, yes, t=50 * gamma.

Thus, the distance is 60,000 * (50 * gamma).

So, 60,000 *50 * gamma = 3,000,000 * gamma.

Gamma is approximately 1.0206, so 3,000,000 *1.0206 ≈3,061,800 km.

So, the answer is about 3,061,800 km, which rounds to 3,060,000 km as per option D.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame and account for relativistic effects due to the high velocity of 60,000 km/s (approximately 2% of the speed of light). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Relative Motion and Time Dilation**:  
   In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. Conversely, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at the same speed. Due to special relativity, time dilation occurs because the ejecta's clock (in its frame) runs slower compared to the Galaxy's clock. The relationship between the time intervals in the two frames is given by the time dilation formula:  
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t'
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \), \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \).  

2. **Calculate \( \gamma \)**:  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \left(\frac{60,000}{300,000}\right)^2 = 0.04
   \]  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  

3. **Relate Time Intervals**:  
   In the ejecta's frame, \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \). Using the time dilation formula, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t' = 1.0206 \cdot 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]  

4. **Calculate Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]  

5. **Compare with Options**:  
   The calculated distance \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \) is closest to option \( D \), which is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
