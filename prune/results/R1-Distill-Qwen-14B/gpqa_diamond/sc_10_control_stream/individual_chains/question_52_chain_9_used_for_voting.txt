Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think out loud.

Okay, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor would be ratio_without_spots divided by ratio_with_spots.

Wait, the problem mentions that the transition between these levels is about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet. So I'm thinking this has to do with the Saha equation or maybe the Boltzmann equation, as it relates to ionization and excitation states of atoms in the stellar atmosphere.

Wait, the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so the Saha equation applies. The Saha equation relates the ionization states of atoms to temperature and electron density, but here we're dealing with two energy levels of the same ion (neutral Ti in this case), so maybe it's the Boltzmann equation we need.

The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of atoms in different energy levels. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but wait, so the ratio of levels is n1/n2, which is the inverse. Because the question says the ratio decreases when there are spots. Let me think: when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So, if the temperature decreases, how does this affect the population ratio.

Wait, the energy difference between the two levels is fixed (since it's the same transition). So for a lower temperature, the exponential term would become more significant. Because when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger (since denominator is smaller). So the exponential factor would be smaller.

But wait, let's think about the ratio n1/n2. The ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, which makes the exponential larger. So n1/n2 would increase as T decreases, meaning that n2/n1 would decrease. That's what's happening here: when the star has spots, T_eff goes down, so the ratio n1/n2 increases, but the question says the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, wait. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So let's get back. Let me clarify.

Let me define the ratio as R = n1 / n2. So when the star has spots (lower T), R decreases. So R is smaller when T is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). If T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (since E2-E1 is positive), so R increases. But that's conflicting with the observation.

Wait, maybe I got the levels mixed up. Maybe E2 is higher than E1, so if the star is hotter, more atoms are excited to E2. So when the star is hotter (no spots), more in E2, so n2 is higher, making R = n1/n2 lower.

Wait, let me think. For a higher temperature, higher energy levels are more populated. So if E2 is higher than E1, when T increases, n2 increases, so n1/n2 decreases. So when T is higher (no spots), R (n1/n2) is lower. But when T is lower (with spots), R is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases. So that's the opposite of what's happening according to the model.

Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement.

Wait, going back: the ratio of the number of Ti in level 1 and level 2. So the ratio R is n1/n2. Without spots, the Teff is 6000 K. With spots, it's 5500 K. The observed ratio R is lower when there are spots.

Wait, according to Boltzmann, when T is lower, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is larger, so R (n1/n2) is larger. So if without spots, T is higher, R is lower. With spots, T is lower, R is higher. But the observation says R is lower when spots are present. So that's a contradiction. So maybe I got the levels reversed? Or perhaps the transition is from a higher to lower level, not lower to higher? Or perhaps the energy difference is negative?

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me denote E1 as the lower energy level and E2 as higher. So E2 > E1. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1.

The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

If T increases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) decreases, so R becomes smaller. So n1/n2 decreases, meaning that n2/n1 increases.

So when T is higher (no spots), R is lower. When T is lower (spots), R is higher.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, R decreases. So according to the problem, R is lower when T is lower. That's the opposite of what the model suggests. So either I'm misunderstanding the problem, or perhaps the levels are in the opposite order.

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2? Let me check the problem statement again.

Question: the ratio of the number of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2), observed to decrease when the star has spots.

Let me define the ratio as R = n2/n1. So when T decreases, n2/n1 would decrease because n2 would be lower in a lower temperature.

Wait, let's see: If E2 > E1, then when T is lower, the population in E2 (n2) decreases more than E1 (n1), so the ratio n2/n1 would decrease.

So if the observed R is n2/n1, then when T is lower, R is lower. That's consistent with the problem statement.

But in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots (lower T). So R = n2/n1 is lower when T is lower. That makes sense, because lower T means more atoms are in the lower energy level.

So perhaps the ratio in question is n2/n1. So R = n2/n1.

So the question is to find the factor by which (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

So the factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

Which would be [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_with) ) ] 

Wait, no. Wait, R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) * something?

Wait, wait. The Boltzmann equation is: 

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative. So exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) gets smaller, meaning n2/n1 decreases.

So for higher T (no spots, T=6000), n2/n1 is higher. For lower T (spots, T=5500), n2/n1 is lower. So R_no = (n2/n1)_no_spots = higher. R_with = (n2/n1)_spots = lower.

So the factor is R_no / R_with.

So the ratio factor is [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_with) ) ]

The (g2/g1) cancels out, so it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_with) ] )

Factor = exp( ΔE/k [ 1/(T_with) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b), so:

exp( ( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T_with) ) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T_with) - 1/(T_no) ) )

So the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_with - 1/T_no) )

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 1/T_with - 1/T_no:

T_with is 5500 K, T_no is 6000 K.

So 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667. The difference is about 0.0000151.

So 1/T_with - 1/T_no = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151.

So:

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) * (0.0000151) )

But what is ΔE?

We know that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy ΔE is related to the photon energy. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light. So ΔE = hc / λ.

But in the Boltzmann equation, the energy is in terms of kT. So let's compute the exponent.

Let me compute (ΔE)/(k) = (hc)/(k λ).

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So let's compute hc/(k λ):

(6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.38e-23 * 1448e-10 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1448e-10 = 1.38 * 1448 * 1e-33 ≈ (1.38 * 1448) ≈ 1994.64e-33 J m.

So denominator ≈ 1.99464e-30 J m.

So hc/(k λ) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.99464e-30 ) ≈ approx (2e-25)/(2e-30) )= 1e5, but let's compute it accurately.

1.9878e-25 / 1.99464e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.99464) * 1e5 ≈ (0.9965) * 1e5 ≈ 99650.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99650 K.

So now, the exponent:

(ΔE)/(k) * (1/T_with - 1/T_no ) = 99650 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) 

Wait, I think I had it wrong earlier. Let me recompute the 1/T_with and 1/T_no.

Wait, in the exponent, it's [1/T_with - 1/T_no] = [1/5500 - 1/6000] = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(3.3e7) )= 5e2 / 3.3e7 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So 99650 * 1.515e-5 = ?

Compute 99650 * 1.515e-5:

9.965e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.965 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

9.965 * 1.515 ≈ let's calculate:

10 * 1.515 =15.15, but 9.965 is 0.035 less than 10. So 15.15 - 0.035*1.515 ≈ 15.15 - 0.053 ≈ 15.097.

So 15.097 * 0.1 ≈ 1.5097.

So the exponent is approximately 1.51.

So the factor is exp(1.51) ≈ e^1.51.

What's e^1.51?

We know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let me compute e^1.51:

1.51 is 1.5 + 0.01.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

The derivative of e^x is e^x. So e^1.51 ≈ e^1.5 * (1 + 0.01 * e^0.01) )

Wait, that's a Taylor expansion approximation. Wait, more accurately, perhaps using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, think of it as e^1.51 = e^(1.5 + 0.01) = e^1.5 * e^0.01.

e^0.01 ≈ 1 + 0.01 + 0.00005 ≈ 1.01005.

So 4.4817 * 1.01005 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.01 ≈ 4.5265.

So approximately 4.53.

So the factor is approximately 4.53.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, option D is ~2.9, option B is ~7.8, A is ~1.1.

So the factor is around 4.5. So the answer would be option C.

To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference (\( \Delta E \))
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.36 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert \( \Delta E \) to units of \( kT \) by dividing by \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.36 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 98580 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The effective temperatures are \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The term \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33000000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
Substitute into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(98580 \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right).
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
98580 \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.51.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.51) \approx 4.53.
\]

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \), which corresponds to option **C**.

Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and think out loud.

Okay, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and its radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're asked to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor would be ratio_without_spots divided by ratio_with_spots.

Wait, the problem mentions that the transition between these levels is about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet. So I'm thinking this has to do with the Saha equation or maybe the Boltzmann equation, as it relates to ionization and excitation states of atoms in the stellar atmosphere.

The Saha equation relates the ionization states of atoms to temperature and electron density, but here we're dealing with two energy levels of the same ion (neutral Ti in this case), so maybe it's the Boltzmann equation we need.

The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of atoms in different energy levels. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but wait, so the ratio of levels is n1/n2, which is the inverse. Because the question says the ratio decreases when there are spots. Let me think: when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K). So, if the temperature decreases, how does this affect the population ratio.

Wait, the energy difference between the two levels is fixed (since it's the same transition). So for a lower temperature, the exponential term would become more significant. Because when T is lower, (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger (since denominator is smaller). So the exponential factor would be smaller.

But wait, let's think about the ratio n1/n2. The ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So when T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, which makes the exponential larger. So n1/n2 would increase as T decreases, meaning that n2/n1 would decrease. That's what's happening here: when the star has spots, T_eff goes down, so the ratio n1/n2 increases, but the question says the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, the question says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots.

Wait, wait. The problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So let's get back. Let me clarify.

Let me define the ratio as R = n1 / n2. So when the star has spots (lower T), R decreases. So R is smaller when T is lower. But according to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). If T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (since E2-E1 is positive), so R increases. But that's conflicting with the observation.

Wait, maybe I got the levels mixed up. Maybe E2 is higher than E1, so if the star is hotter, more atoms are excited to E2. So when the star is hotter (no spots), more in E2, so n2 is higher, making R = n1/n2 lower.

Wait, let me think. For a higher temperature, higher energy levels are more populated. So if E2 is higher than E1, when T increases, n2 increases, so n1/n2 decreases. So when T is higher (no spots), R (n1/n2) is lower. But when T is lower (with spots), R is higher. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio R decreases. So that's the opposite of what's happening according to the model.

Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement.

Wait, going back: the ratio of the number of Ti in level 1 and level 2. So the ratio R is n1/n2. Without spots, the Teff is 6000 K. With spots, it's 5500 K. The observed ratio R is lower when there are spots.

Wait, according to Boltzmann, when T is lower, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is larger, so R (n1/n2) is larger. So if without spots, T is higher, R is lower. With spots, T is lower, R is higher. But the observation says R is lower when spots are present. So that's a contradiction. So maybe I got the levels reversed? Or perhaps the transition is from a higher to lower level, not lower to higher? Or perhaps the energy difference is negative?

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me denote E1 as the lower energy level and E2 as higher. So E2 > E1. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1.

The ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

If T increases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) decreases, so R becomes smaller. So n1/n2 decreases, meaning that n2/n1 increases.

So when T is higher (no spots), R is lower. When T is lower (spots), R is higher.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, R decreases. So according to the problem, R is lower when T is lower. That's the opposite of what the model suggests. So either I'm misunderstanding the problem, or perhaps the levels are in the opposite order.

Wait, perhaps the observed ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2? Let me check the problem statement again.

Question: the ratio of the number of Ti in two levels (level 1 and level 2), observed to decrease when the star has spots.

Let me define the ratio as R = n2/n1. So when T decreases, n2/n1 would decrease because n2 would be lower in a lower temperature.

Wait, let's see: If E2 > E1, then when T is lower, the population in E2 (n2) decreases more than E1 (n1), so the ratio n2/n1 would decrease.

So if the observed R is n2/n1, then when T is lower, R is lower. That's consistent with the problem statement.

But in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots (lower T). So R = n2/n1 is lower when T is lower. That makes sense, because lower T means more atoms are in the lower energy level.

So perhaps the ratio in question is n2/n1. So R = n2/n1.

So the question is to find the factor by which (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

So the factor is R_no_spots / R_with_spots.

Which would be [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T_no)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_with) ) ] 

Wait, no. Wait, R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) * something?

Wait, wait. The Boltzmann equation is: 

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative. So exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) gets smaller, meaning n2/n1 decreases.

So for higher T (no spots, T=6000), n2/n1 is higher. For lower T (spots, T=5500), n2/n1 is lower. So R_no = (n2/n1)_no_spots = higher. R_with = (n2/n1)_spots = lower.

So the factor is R_no / R_with.

So the ratio factor is [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_with) ) ]

The (g2/g1) cancels out, so it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T_no) + ΔE/(k T_with) ] )

Factor = exp( ΔE/k [ 1/(T_with) - 1/(T_no) ] )

Wait, because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b), so:

exp( ( -ΔE/(k T_no) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T_with) ) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T_with) - 1/(T_no) ) )

So the factor is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T_with - 1/T_no) )

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 1/T_with - 1/T_no:

T_with is 5500 K, T_no is 6000 K.

So 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667. The difference is about 0.0000151.

So 1/T_with - 1/T_no = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151.

So:

Factor = exp( ΔE/(k) * (0.0000151) )

But what is ΔE?

We know that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So the energy ΔE is related to the photon energy. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light. So ΔE = hc / λ.

But in the Boltzmann equation, the energy is in terms of kT. So let's compute the exponent.

Let me compute (ΔE)/(k) = (hc)/(k λ).

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So let's compute hc/(k λ):

(6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.38e-23 * 1448e-10 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1448e-10 = 1.38 * 1448 * 1e-33 ≈ (1.38 * 1448) ≈ 1994.64e-33 J m.

So denominator ≈ 1.99464e-30 J m.

So hc/(k λ) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (1.99464e-30 ) ≈ approx (2e-25)/(2e-30) )= 1e5, but let's compute it accurately.

1.9878e-25 / 1.99464e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.99464) * 1e5 ≈ (0.9965) * 1e5 ≈ 99650.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99650 K.

So now, the exponent:

(ΔE)/(k) * (1/T_with - 1/T_no ) = 99650 * (1/5500 - 1/6000) 

Wait, I think I had it wrong earlier. Let me recompute the 1/T_with and 1/T_no.

Wait, in the exponent, it's [1/T_with - 1/T_no] = [1/5500 - 1/6000] = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500/(3.3e7) )= 5e2 / 3.3e7 ≈ 1.515e-5.

So 99650 * 1.515e-5 = ?

Compute 99650 * 1.515e-5:

9.965e4 * 1.515e-5 = (9.965 * 1.515) * 1e-1.

9.965 * 1.515 ≈ let's calculate:

10 * 1.515 =15.15, but 9.965 is 0.035 less than 10. So 15.15 - 0.035*1.515 ≈ 15.15 - 0.053 ≈ 15.097.

So 15.097 * 0.1 ≈ 1.5097.

So the exponent is approximately 1.51.

So the factor is exp(1.51) ≈ e^1.51.

What's e^1.51?

We know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let me compute e^1.51:

1.51 is 1.5 + 0.01.

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

The derivative of e^x is e^x. So e^1.51 ≈ e^1.5 * (1 + 0.01 * e^0.01) )

Wait, that's a Taylor expansion approximation. Wait, more accurately, perhaps using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, think of it as e^1.51 = e^(1.5 + 0.01) = e^1.5 * e^0.01.

e^0.01 ≈ 1 + 0.01 + 0.00005 ≈ 1.01005.

So 4.4817 * 1.01005 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.01 ≈ 4.5265.

So approximately 4.53.

So the factor is approximately 4.53.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, option D is ~2.9, option B is ~7.8, A is ~1.1.

So the factor is around 4.5. So the answer would be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute the energy difference (\( \Delta E \))
The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.36 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert \( \Delta E \) to units of \( kT \) by dividing by \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.36 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 98580 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the temperature difference term
The effective temperatures are \( T_{\text{no spots}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The term \( \frac{1}{T_{\text{spots}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{no spots}}} \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33000000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the factor
Substitute into the factor expression:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(98580 \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5}\right).
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
98580 \cdot 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.51.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.51) \approx 4.53.
\]

### Final Answer
The factor by which the ratio changes is approximately \( 4.5 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
