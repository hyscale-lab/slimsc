Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. Their orbits are circular, and they were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure how that method affects the problem here, maybe it's just context.

The question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Hmm, wait, equilibrium temperature—so that's probably related to the star they're orbiting and their distance from it. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = (L / (16πσ))^(1/4) * (1/(a(1-e²)^0.5)) )^(1/4), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies. So T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / a^(1/2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature. Alternatively, another version I remember is T_planet = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2). Or maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) ), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_s * ( (1 - albedo) / (2) )^(1/4) * (R_s / (a)) )^(-1/2). Hmm. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux from the star at a distance a is F = L/(4πa²). The planet absorbs (1 - albedo) * F, and then radiates as a blackbody. So the equilibrium condition is F*(1 - a) /4 = σ T_p^4. So solving for T_p, we get T_p = [ F*(1 - a)/4 / σ ]^(1/4) = [ (L/(4πa²)) * (1 - a)/4 / σ ) ]^(1/4 ). Simplifying, that's [ L (1 - a) ] / ( 16 π σ a² ) )^(1/4 ), which can be written as T_p = ( L^(1/4) (1 - a)^(1/4) ) / ( (16 π σ )^(1/4) a^(1/2) ) ). So because the albedo is the same for all three planets (given as 0.3), that term (1 - a) is the same for all, so when taking the ratio of temperatures, those terms will cancel.

So for the ratio T1/T2, it's [ ( L^(1/4) / a1^(1/2) ) ] / [ ( L^(1/4) / a2^(1/2) ) ) ] = a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Wait, wait, because T_p is proportional to ( L^(1/4) ) / ( a^(1/2) ). So T1 = k * L^(1/4) / a1^(1/2), T2 = k * L^(1/4) / a2^(1/2). So T1 / T2 = (a2 / a1 )^(1/2). So (T1/T2)^2 = a2/a1. So a2 = a1 * (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, but the given ratio is T1/T2 ≈1.4. So T1 = 1.4 T2. So the ratio squared is (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2 = 1.96 → a2 = 1.96 a1. So the semi-major axis of Planet2 is about 1.96 times that of Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3 = 2.3. So T2 = 2.3 T3. So then (T2/T3)^2 = a3/a2 → (2.3)^2 = a3/a2 → a3 = (2.3)^2 * a2. 2.3 squared is 5.29. So a3 =5.29 a2.

Putting it all together, a2 =1.96 a1; a3 =5.29 a2 =5.29 *1.96 a1. Let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96. Hmm, 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So a3 ≈10.3684 a1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period. Kepler's third law comes into play here. The period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the mass of the star (but the problem doesn't give the star's mass, so perhaps we can assume it's the same for all planets, which makes sense). Wait, but Kepler's law in the context of a planet orbiting a star is usually expressed as P² = (4π²/G M_star) a³. So the period depends on a^(3/2) and inversely on the square root of the star's mass. But since all three planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for all. So P is proportional to a^(3/2).

So I need to find the ratio P3 / P1. Since a3 = ~10.368 a1, the ratio (a3/a1) is approximately 10.368. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.368)^(3/2).

Wait, let me compute that. 10.368^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(10.368)^3. Let me compute sqrt(10.368). Hmm, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(16) is 4. 10.368 is about 10.4. Hmm, sqrt(10.4) is approximately 3.225. Because 3.225^2 is about 10.39, which is close to 10.4. So sqrt(10.368) is about 3.222.

So (3.222)^3. Let me compute that. 3^3 is 27. 3.2^3 is 32.768. Hmm, 3.222^3.

Let me compute it step by step. 3.222 *3.222 = (3.2)^2 + 2*(3.2)(0.022) + (0.022)^2. Wait, maybe it's easier to multiply 3.222 *3.222.

3.222 *3.222:

3.222 * 3 = 9.666
3.222*0.2= 0.6444 → 9.666 + 0.6444 = 10.3104
3.222*0.02=0.06444 → 10.3104 + 0.06444=10.37484
3.222*0.002=0.006444 → 10.37484 +0.006444=10.381284.

So 3.222^2 ≈10.3813. Now, multiply that by 3.222 to get (3.222)^3.

So 10.3813 *3.222.

Let me compute 10 *3.222 =32.22.

0.3813 *3.222 ≈.

Well, 0.3 *3.222 =0.9666
0.08 *3.222=0.25776
0.0013 *3.222=0.0041884
Adding these: 0.9666 +0.25776=1.22436 +0.0041884=1.2285484.

So total is 32.22 +1.2285484 ≈33.448548.

So (3.222)^3 ≈33.45. So P3/P1 is approximately 33.45.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation. Because 10.368 is approximately 10.368. Wait, 10.368^(3/2) is the same as a3^(3/2)/a1^(3/2) → (10.368)^(3/2).

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 10.368^1.5 using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that 10.368 is 10.368. Let me compute the cube of the square root.

Wait, sqrt(10.368) is approximately 3.222 as I found earlier. So 3.222 cubed is about 33.448, as calculated.

So the ratio of periods is approximately 33.4, so P3 is about 33.4 times larger than P1.

Looking back at the options given:

Options:
A) ~10.4
B) ~3.2
C) ~4.4
D) ~33.4

So option D is 33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_p to T_q is (a_p / a_q )^(-1/2). Wait, no, wait. Because T_p is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / a^(1/2). So T_p / T_q = (a_q / a_p )^(1/2). So if T1 is larger than T2 by a factor of 1.4, then (T1/T2) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So 1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 ). Then (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 =1.96 a1.

Similarly, T2 / T3 = 2.3 → T2=2.3 T3. So (T2/T3) = sqrt( a3/a2 ) → 2.3 = sqrt( a3/a2 ) → a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 =5.29 → a3=5.29 a2.

So substituting a2=1.96 a1 into a3: a3=5.29 *1.96 a1. Let me compute 5.29 *1.96.

5.29 *1.96.

Well, 5 *1.96 =9.8.

0.29 *1.96: 0.2 *1.96 =0.392; 0.09 *1.96=0.1764. So 0.392 +0.1764=0.5684.

So 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So a3=10.3684 a1.

Then, Kepler's law says P^2 ∝ a^3. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2) = (10.3684 )^(3/2 ). As I computed earlier, this is approximately 33.4.

So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than Planet1.

So the correct answer is D) ~33.4.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply the relationships between equilibrium temperature, semi-major axis, and orbital period.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to \( T_p \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Since the albedo is the same for all three planets, the ratio of temperatures can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}, \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}
\]

From the problem:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \), so \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \), meaning \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \).
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \), so \( \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \), meaning \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \).

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \), we find:

\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 a_1 = 10.3684 a_1
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.3684 \) times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Orbital Period and Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

\[
P^2 \propto a^3 \implies \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.3684 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

First, compute \( \sqrt{10.3684} \), which is approximately \( 3.222 \). Then, cube this value:

\[
(3.222)^3 \approx 33.45
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \( 33.4 \) times larger than that of Planet1.

### Final Answer
From the given options:
- A) ~10.4
- B) ~3.2
- C) ~4.4
- D) ~33.4

The correct answer is **D) ~33.4**.

Hmm, wait, equilibrium temperature—so that's probably related to the star they're orbiting and their distance from it. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = (L / (16πσ))^(1/4) * (1/(a(1-e²)^0.5)) )^(1/4), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it simplifies. So T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / a^(1/2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature. Alternatively, another version I remember is T_planet = T_star * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2). Or maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) ), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach. The equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_s * ( (1 - albedo) / (2) )^(1/4) * (R_s / (a)) )^(-1/2). Hmm. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux from the star at a distance a is F = L/(4πa²). The planet absorbs (1 - albedo) * F, and then radiates as a blackbody. So the equilibrium condition is F*(1 - a) /4 = σ T_p^4. So solving for T_p, we get T_p = [ F*(1 - a)/4 / σ ]^(1/4) = [ (L/(4πa²)) * (1 - a)/4 / σ ) ]^(1/4 ). Simplifying, that's [ L (1 - a) ] / ( 16 π σ a² ) )^(1/4 ), which can be written as T_p = ( L^(1/4) (1 - a)^(1/4) ) / ( (16 π σ )^(1/4) a^(1/2) ) ). So because the albedo is the same for all three planets (given as 0.3), that term (1 - a) is the same for all, so when taking the ratio of temperatures, those terms will cancel.

So for the ratio T1/T2, it's [ ( L^(1/4) / a1^(1/2) ) ] / [ ( L^(1/4) / a2^(1/2) ) ) ] = a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ). Wait, wait, because T_p is proportional to ( L^(1/4) ) / ( a^(1/2) ). So T1 = k * L^(1/4) / a1^(1/2), T2 = k * L^(1/4) / a2^(1/2). So T1 / T2 = (a2 / a1 )^(1/2). So (T1/T2)^2 = a2/a1. So a2 = a1 * (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, but the given ratio is T1/T2 ≈1.4. So T1 = 1.4 T2. So the ratio squared is (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^2 = 1.96 → a2 = 1.96 a1. So the semi-major axis of Planet2 is about 1.96 times that of Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3 = 2.3. So T2 = 2.3 T3. So then (T2/T3)^2 = a3/a2 → (2.3)^2 = a3/a2 → a3 = (2.3)^2 * a2. 2.3 squared is 5.29. So a3 =5.29 a2.

Putting it all together, a2 =1.96 a1; a3 =5.29 a2 =5.29 *1.96 a1. Let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96. Hmm, 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So a3 ≈10.3684 a1.

Now, the question is about the orbital period. Kepler's third law comes into play here. The period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the mass of the star (but the problem doesn't give the star's mass, so perhaps we can assume it's the same for all planets, which makes sense). Wait, but Kepler's law in the context of a planet orbiting a star is usually expressed as P² = (4π²/G M_star) a³. So the period depends on a^(3/2) and inversely on the square root of the star's mass. But since all three planets are orbiting the same star, M_star is the same for all. So P is proportional to a^(3/2).

So I need to find the ratio P3 / P1. Since a3 = ~10.368 a1, the ratio (a3/a1) is approximately 10.368. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.368)^(3/2).

Wait, let me compute that. 10.368^(3/2) is the same as sqrt(10.368)^3. Let me compute sqrt(10.368). Hmm, sqrt(9) is 3, sqrt(16) is 4. 10.368 is about 10.4. Hmm, sqrt(10.4) is approximately 3.225. Because 3.225^2 is about 10.39, which is close to 10.4. So sqrt(10.368) is about 3.222.

So (3.222)^3. Let me compute that. 3^3 is 27. 3.2^3 is 32.768. Hmm, 3.222^3.

Let me compute it step by step. 3.222 *3.222 = (3.2)^2 + 2*(3.2)(0.022) + (0.022)^2. Wait, maybe it's easier to multiply 3.222 *3.222.

3.222 *3.222:

3.222 * 3 = 9.666
3.222*0.2= 0.6444 → 9.666 + 0.6444 = 10.3104
3.222*0.02=0.06444 → 10.3104 + 0.06444=10.37484
3.222*0.002=0.006444 → 10.37484 +0.006444=10.381284.

So 3.222^2 ≈10.3813. Now, multiply that by 3.222 to get (3.222)^3.

So 10.3813 *3.222.

Let me compute 10 *3.222 =32.22.

0.3813 *3.222 ≈.

Well, 0.3 *3.222 =0.9666
0.08 *3.222=0.25776
0.0013 *3.222=0.0041884
Adding these: 0.9666 +0.25776=1.22436 +0.0041884=1.2285484.

So total is 32.22 +1.2285484 ≈33.448548.

So (3.222)^3 ≈33.45. So P3/P1 is approximately 33.45.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation. Because 10.368 is approximately 10.368. Wait, 10.368^(3/2) is the same as a3^(3/2)/a1^(3/2) → (10.368)^(3/2).

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 10.368^1.5 using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that 10.368 is 10.368. Let me compute the cube of the square root.

Wait, sqrt(10.368) is approximately 3.222 as I found earlier. So 3.222 cubed is about 33.448, as calculated.

So the ratio of periods is approximately 33.4, so P3 is about 33.4 times larger than P1.

Looking back at the options given:

Options:
A) ~10.4
B) ~3.2
C) ~4.4
D) ~33.4

So option D is 33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T_p to T_q is (a_p / a_q )^(-1/2). Wait, no, wait. Because T_p is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / a^(1/2). So T_p / T_q = (a_q / a_p )^(1/2). So if T1 is larger than T2 by a factor of 1.4, then (T1/T2) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). So 1.4 = sqrt( a2/a1 ). Then (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 =1.96 a1.

Similarly, T2 / T3 = 2.3 → T2=2.3 T3. So (T2/T3) = sqrt( a3/a2 ) → 2.3 = sqrt( a3/a2 ) → a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 =5.29 → a3=5.29 a2.

So substituting a2=1.96 a1 into a3: a3=5.29 *1.96 a1. Let me compute 5.29 *1.96.

5.29 *1.96.

Well, 5 *1.96 =9.8.

0.29 *1.96: 0.2 *1.96 =0.392; 0.09 *1.96=0.1764. So 0.392 +0.1764=0.5684.

So 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So a3=10.3684 a1.

Then, Kepler's law says P^2 ∝ a^3. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1 )^(3/2) = (10.3684 )^(3/2 ). As I computed earlier, this is approximately 33.4.

So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times larger than Planet1.

So the correct answer is D) ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply the relationships between equilibrium temperature, semi-major axis, and orbital period.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Semi-Major Axis
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is proportional to \( T_p \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis. Since the albedo is the same for all three planets, the ratio of temperatures can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}, \quad \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}
\]

From the problem:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \), so \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \), meaning \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \).
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \), so \( \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \), meaning \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \).

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \), we find:

\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 a_1 = 10.3684 a_1
\]

Thus, the semi-major axis of Planet3 is approximately \( 10.3684 \) times that of Planet1.

### Step 2: Orbital Period and Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

\[
P^2 \propto a^3 \implies \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.3684 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

First, compute \( \sqrt{10.3684} \), which is approximately \( 3.222 \). Then, cube this value:

\[
(3.222)^3 \approx 33.45
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately \( 33.4 \) times larger than that of Planet1.

### Final Answer
From the given options:
- A) ~10.4
- B) ~3.2
- C) ~4.4
- D) ~33.4

The correct answer is **D) ~33.4**.

Answer: D
