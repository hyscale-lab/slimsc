Okay, so I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for this di-substituted aromatic compound. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Wait, di-substituted aromatic ring usually has two substituents. So, the ring is benzene (6 carbons), so the substituents add 2 more carbons. That makes sense because 6 + 2 is 8.

The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, substituents on the benzene must include a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, the substituents can't both be on the ring directly because that might not lead to 8 carbons. Let me think again: benzene has 6 carbons, so substituents must add 2 more. So, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, -CO-) and the other is a halogen (like -X). Or wait, perhaps the substituents are more complex.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group attached via a chain. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group and an alkyl halide. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2 more. So each substituent is one carbon? No, because two substituents would add two carbons. But wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is O=C-R), but that R adds some carbons. Or perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but that would only add one carbon each, but maybe more.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene, so two substituents. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is one carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, that can't be. Oh wait, maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a halogen (which doesn't add any carbons). So substituents would be, for example, a -CH2-CO- group and a -X (halogen). Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, another approach: the substituents must add two carbons. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another group. Let's think about possible structures.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a ketone group and a halogen. But a ketone group is O=C-R. So if R is a methyl group, for example, that would add 1 carbon. But then another substituent would need to add another carbon. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl (like an acetyl group, -COCH3, which adds 2 carbons) and the other substituent is a halogen (-X), which doesn't add any carbons. Wait, wait, that would make substituents add 2 + 0 = 2 carbons. So total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (substituents) = 8. That fits.

So, the structure would have two substituents: one is an acetyl group (-COCH3) and the other is a halogen (-X). So the benzene ring has these two groups attached. Now, the substituents' positions matter for the NMR. Since it's di-substituted, the positions could be para, meta, or ortho.

But let me think about the NMR signals each substituent would produce.

The carbonyl group (from the acetyl) is a ketone, so the adjacent CH3 would show up around 2.1-2.6 ppm as a singlet because it's attached to a carbonyl. Wait, but in some cases, like in acetophenone, the CH3 is around 2.6 ppm as a singlet.

The halogen substituent, like chlorine or bromine, would typically not have protons attached, so that might not show up in the 1H NMR. Wait, unless it's a substituent like -CH2Cl or something with adjacent protons. Wait, no, the substituents are -COCH3 and -X (where X is a halogen, say Cl). So the Cl is directly attached to the benzene ring, so no protons there. So in the NMR, I wouldn't expect a signal from the Cl.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have a singlet around 2.3 ppm (like option C). That might correspond to a methyl group attached to something, maybe the carbonyl.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an alkoxy group with a halogen, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Wait, the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond, so the substituent is directly attached, like -X.

So the structure would be something like benzene with a -COCH3 and a -X group attached. So the NMR should show the aromatic protons, the CH3 adjacent to the carbonyl, and perhaps some other substituents.

Wait, but let's see the options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm. A singlet at 9.9 ppm is very deshielded, suggesting maybe an aldehyde proton, but that doesn't fit with a carbonyl as a ketone. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton in a highly deshielded position, but not sure. The 3.7 ppm singlet of 2H suggests maybe OCH2O or something else, but I'm not certain.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). Those look like protons adjacent to an oxygen, maybe in an ether or ester. The doublets at around 4.8 and 4.6 could be from CH2 groups next to an electronegative atom. The singlet at 1.3 could be a methyl group attached to something else. But I don't see where the carbonyl would be here. Maybe the structure is something like a di-substituted benzene with two ether groups, but that doesn't fit our substituents (we need a carbonyl and a halogen). So probably not this option.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The aromatic protons as doublets sum to 4H, which suggests a para-substituted pattern. The 2.3 ppm singlet is probably the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (like in acetophenone). So in this case, the substituents are a -COCH3 and a halogen. But wait, the other substituent, the halogen, wouldn't show up in the NMR except for affecting the aromatic protons.

But wait, the aromatic protons' shifts would depend on the substituents. So, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, one being a strong electron-withdrawing group (like -COCH3) and the other a halogen (like Cl), the aromatic protons would be deshielded and could appear as two doublets (for the two sets of equivalent Hs). The 7.8 and 7.6 ppm are in the range for aromatic protons with substituents. Let me think about that.

If the substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of two equivalent protons each. For example, in para-substituted benzene, you have two sets of doublets. So, in option C, the 7.8 (d) and 7.6 (d) each have 2H. That fits. And the 2.3 ppm singlet is the CH3 from the acetyl group. So this option looks promising.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The singlet at 6.9 is an aromatic proton, perhaps in a meta position. The 4.8 and 4.6 doublets could be CH2 groups next to oxygen. The 1.3 singlet might be another CH2 or a methyl group. But again, I don't see where the carbonyl would be here. This option doesn't seem to fit with having a carbonyl group.

So putting it together, option C matches the scenario where the substituents are an acetyl group (-COCH3) and a halogen (-X), perhaps Cl. The NMR shows four aromatic protons as two doublets (so para-substituted), and a singlet for the acetyl methyl group at ~2.3 ppm. That fits with the IR showing a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, but why is the option C's aromatic protons in the 7.8 and 7.6 regions? Let me recall that in acetophenone (which has a -COCH3 substituent), the aromatic protons are typically around 7.4-7.6 ppm. But if there's another substituent, like a halogen, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, the ring's protons would be more deshielded, moving upfield or downfield?

Wait, the substituents are para to each other. The acetyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG), which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. Similarly, the halogen (which is also EWG) would have a similar effect.

In para-substituted benzene with two EWGs, the ring's protons would be in a symmetrical arrangement. The H's ortho to the substituents would be deshielded and appear downfield. So, the two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm make sense. So, the 7.8 is possibly the two protons adjacent to the acetyl group, and 7.6 adjacent to the halogen. Or vice versa, depending on their electron-withdrawing strengths. Alternatively, considering the substituents' influence, the more electron-withdrawing group (like the acetyl) would cause a larger downfield shift.

So, the NMR in option C fits this scenario.

Looking at the other options again: option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I thought might be an aldehyde proton. But our substituents don't include an aldehyde. So option A might not fit unless there's another structure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group as part of an ester or another functional group. Let me think about another structure. Suppose the di-substituted benzene has a ketone and an alkoxy group with a halogen. No, because the IR shows a carbonyl and a halogen bond, so the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, could the substituents be -CO- (like a carbonyl as part of a substituent) and an -O-X group? No, because the IR indicates an aromatic-halogen bond, meaning the halogen is directly attached to the ring.

So, I think option C is the correct one. The 1H NMR shows the aromatic protons split into two doublets (4H total, para substitution), and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, meaning the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., -COCH₃, an acetyl group) and a halogen (-X, such as chlorine or bromine).

The NMR data must reflect this structure. The aromatic protons will appear as two doublets (2H each) due to the para-substitution pattern, as the substituents are symmetrical and strongly electron-withdrawing. This causes the aromatic protons to be deshielded and shifted downfield. The methyl group attached to the carbonyl (from the acetyl group) will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the presence of a ketone (C=O). Additionally, the singlet at 3.7 ppm (2H) does not align with the expected NMR signals for the substituents. This option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: The doublets at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm and the singlet at 1.3 ppm suggest protons adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as in an ether or ester. However, this does not match the required substituents (a carbonyl and a halogen). This option is incorrect.

- **Option C**: The doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H) correspond to aromatic protons in a para-substitution pattern. The singlet at 2.3 ppm matches the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (e.g., -COCH₃). This option is consistent with the structure and IR data.

- **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H) suggests an aromatic proton in a meta position, which does not fit the para-substitution pattern. Additionally, the doublets at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm and the singlet at 1.3 ppm do not align with the expected NMR signals for the substituents. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, as it matches the expected signals for a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group (-COCH₃) and a halogen (-X).
