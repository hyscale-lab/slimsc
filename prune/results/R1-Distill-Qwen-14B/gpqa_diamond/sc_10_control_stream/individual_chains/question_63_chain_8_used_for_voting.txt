Alright, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Okay, the molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. They give the masses as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, when they say the fundamental state, I think that's the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in the ground state, and the photon is being absorbed to take it to the next higher state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, each state is characterized by both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

Wait, the fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state, which is v=0. And the rotational state might be in the ground state as well, which is J=0. So the molecule is in the state (v=0, J=0). Now, when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition to a higher state. But the question is about the lowest possible energy change, so probably the photon will cause the molecule to increase in energy by the smallest possible amount.

Hmm, but wait, what are the possible transitions? I remember that in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, a photon can cause a simultaneous change in both rotational and vibrational states. But the selection rules for vibrational transitions are Δv = ±1, and for rotational, ΔJ = ±1. But since the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think it's about the first excited state. So the molecule would transition to v=1, J=0? Or maybe J increases by 1. Wait, wait, perhaps the question is about the next state in terms of energy, not necessarily a single quantum jump in either mode.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, but it can have different rotational states. Oh, right, the rotational states are quantized as well. So the ground state would have v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy could be v=0, J=1. Because increasing J by 1 would require less energy than increasing v by 1, since vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones.

Wait, let me think about the energy levels. The vibrational energy levels are given by Ev = (v + 1/2)ħω, while the rotational energy levels are EJ = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I is μ R², with μ being the reduced mass.

So the energy spacing for vibrational transitions is on the order of ħω, which is about 4e14 rad/s. But for rotational transitions, each step is (J+1)ħ²/(2I) - Jħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(2I) * (2J+1). Wait, but I think the energy between J and J+1 is proportional to J. So the energy difference for rotational transitions increases with J. So the first rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) would have a smaller energy than the first vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1).

Wait, but let's calculate the energies. Let's compare the energy needed to go from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), and from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0).

First, let's compute the vibrational energy difference. The energy change ΔE_vib is Ev = (v+1/2)ħω - (v +1/2)ħω, but wait, from v=0 to v=1 it's (1 + ½)ħω - (0 + ½)ħω = ħω. So ΔE_vib = ħω ≈ 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = about 2.65e-19 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1. The energy EJ is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So for J=0, E0=0. For J=1, E1 = (2ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So the energy difference is ħ²/(I). 

What is I, the moment of inertia? I = μ R². μ is the reduced mass. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let me compute that. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, and 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

But wait, R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I. Let's compute that. ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Wait, wait, let me compute ħ² / I: 1.112e-68 / (1.208e-46) ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, that's way larger than the vibrational energy difference. Hmm, that suggests that the rotational transition requires way more energy than the vibrational. Wait, that can't be right. Because in reality, in infrared spectroscopy, rotational transitions often accompany vibrational transitions because the energy spacing for vibrations is much larger, and they allow rotational changes via the selection rules.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

So, let me recompute I. 

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 1.81818... amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.8 * 1.66 is about 3, so 1.81818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So R² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Then, ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.208e-46) = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ approximately 0.920e-22 J, which is 9.2e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference is about 9.2e-23 J, and vibrational is 4e14 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ no, wait the vibrational energy per photon is ħω. Wait, ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * 4e14 rad/s ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So the rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) requires about 9.2e-23 J, which is less than the vibrational transition (4.2e-20 J). So why does the rotational transition require less energy? That makes sense because rotational energy levels are closer together.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that the rotational transition would be a smaller energy jump than the vibrational, so the photon would need to supply either one.

But the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one that requires the least energy change.

Which one is lower? 9.2e-23 J is way smaller than 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would have to match that.

Wait, but wait, can the molecule transition only to higher states via photon absorption? So, the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase v by one (v=1, J=0), or increase J by one (v=0, J=1), whichever requires less energy. Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, the photon would have to match that.

Wait, but wait, what if the molecule can only transition between certain states? Let me think about selection rules. For the rigid rotor-vibration model, the selection rules are Δv= ±1 for vibration, and ΔJ= ±1 for rotation. But for the non-rigid rotor, perhaps the selection rule for vibration is still Δv=±1, and rotation ΔJ=±1.

Wait, but in a diatomic molecule, the vibration is along the bond axis, and the rotation is perpendicular. So, the dipole transition for vibration would allow Δv=±1, and for rotation, ΔJ=±1. But in some cases, when a photon is absorbed, both changes can happen. For example, during a vibrational transition, rotational quantum numbers can change by ±1. So the photon's energy would have to account for both the vibrational and rotational changes.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the photon momentum to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state could be either a higher rotational state (same v) or a higher vibrational state (same J). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, I think that's the way to go.

So the photon's energy should match the energy difference needed for the rotational transition.

So the energy of the photon would be E = ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, I might have made a mistake earlier because the calculation for ΔE_rot seems extremely small. Let me check again.

Wait, the formula for rotational energy is E_J = (J (J+1) ħ²) / (2I). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0.

E_1 = (1 * 2 ħ²)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

E_0 is 0, so the energy difference is ħ²/(I).

Wait, so the energy difference is (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (1.208e-46 kg m²).

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 = 1.112, so 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 1.208e-46 kg m².

So E = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So the energy needed is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Hmm. The momentum p of a photon is given by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light, because for photons, E=pc, so p = E/(c).

Alternatively, since E = hf = hc/λ, and p = E/c.

So, since E = 9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) )= 3.067e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 3e-31. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, but wait a second. Did I mix up the energy? Because if the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, then the momentum would be 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But 3e-31 kg·m/s is 3e-31 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, 3e-31 N·s isn't an option. So maybe I did something wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. Then the energy change is ΔE_vib = ħω, and since the rotational state doesn't change, the photon's energy is just that.

Let me compute that. ħω is (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

So the momentum would be 4.218e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) )= 1.406e-28 kg·m/s, which is 1.4e-28 N·s. That's option D.

But earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why is the photon's energy higher in that case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the transition. Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one immediately above the current state, regardless of quantum numbers. Or perhaps the question is considering the first possible transition, which might involve both rotational and vibrational changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used here is the non-rigid rotor model, which treats the molecule as a 3D rotor with a vibrational parameter. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels in the non-rigid rotor model. The energy levels are given by:

E = E_vib + E_rot

E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħ ω

E_rot = (J (J+1) - J0 (J0 +1))/ (2k) ), where J0 is the rotational state at equilibrium bond length, and k is the rotational constant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1). So the energy change is purely rotational, which would require E_rot = 9.2e-23 J. But as I saw earlier, that leads to a momentum of about 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

That suggests that perhaps I should instead consider the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J, leading to p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Wait, but why would the rotational transition require a photon with a lower energy than the vibrational, yet the options don't have such a small p. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, wait another thing. Let me recheck the rotational energy calculation.

I think my mistake might be in the moment of inertia. Because I used I = μ R², but maybe R is the bond length, which is 2 angstroms. So let me recheck that.

μ is the reduced mass. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2 )/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so μ ≈1.818 *1.66e-27 =3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I= μ R² =3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m².

Then, the rotational energy E_J is (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2I).

So when J=0, E_J=0. When J=1, E_J= (2 * ħ² )/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I).

So plugging in the numbers: ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.208e-46 kg m².

So E=1.112e-68 /1.208e-46 = approx 9.2e-23 J.

But when I calculate p=E/c, I get 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are in the order of 1e-28 to 2e-27 N s. So this suggests that perhaps the problem is not about a pure rotational transition but a vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I have misunderstood the question. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state in the rotation-vibration spectrum is typically the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state (v=0, J=0). So the next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

If I'm considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), then the energy required is 9.2e-23 J, which, as I found earlier, would correspond to a photon with momentum 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is looking for the vibrational transition, which would have a larger energy.

So, if the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J (from v=0 to v=1), the momentum would be 4.2e-20 /3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg m/s = 1.4e-28 Ns. That's option D.

But why would the next state with the lowest possible energy be a vibrational transition instead of a rotational one? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so it should be the next state.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rotational energy. Let me compute it more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the rotational energy is E = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I). So delta E is E(J+1) - E(J)= [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I) )= (2J+3) * ħ²/(2I).

Wait, for J=0: E1-E0 is ( (1*2) - (0) ) * ħ²/(2I) )= (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering rotational transitions because the model used is the non-rigid rotor model, which might treat the molecule as a 3D rotor, but I'm not sure if that affects the energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the transition from (v=0,J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which would require the photon's energy to be the vibrational energy.

So, let's compute the photon's momentum in that case.

E_photon = ħ ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

So p = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which matches option D. 1.4e-28 Ns.

But wait, why is the rotational transition (which requires less energy) not being considered? Because in reality, rotational transitions require less energy, so the next state should be the rotational one. But perhaps in this problem, the molecule's next available state is the vibrational transition because the rotational transitions are not allowed under the given model.

Wait, the question states the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor), which implies that both rotational and vibrational transitions are considered. So the next state could be the rotational one if that transition is allowed.

But in that case, the momentum would be 3e-31 Ns, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the problem considers only vibrational transitions, which would make option D the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Let me check the units again.

Wait, when calculating I, μ is in kg, R in meters, so I is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the bond length in the calculation, but maybe I forgot that the bond length is 2 angstroms. No, I used it correctly.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is the one with the smallest possible ΔE. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that would be the next state. So the photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy in terms of angular frequency. Rotational energy levels are given by E_J = J (J+1) ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

Wait, but ω_rot is not given in the problem. Oh, right, the problem gives the vibrational angular frequency, w =4e14 rad/s. The rotational frequency is different and perhaps isn't provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy for the rotation is calculated using the moment of inertia.

Wait, the rotational energy levels can also be expressed using the rotational constant B, where B = ħ²/(2I c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I).

Wait, but I think I did that correctly before.

So perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. But why? Because the rotational transition requires a lower energy, which would be the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the molecule can only change its vibrational state, not rotational. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think: in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, but if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, the next state is a vibrational state, but perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of rotation and vibration, and the first excited state is the first vibrational state.

Hmm, but the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration spectrum is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the case where the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state in energy could be (v=0, J=1), which is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). So the molecule would first transition to (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon with energy 9.2e-23 J. However, since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a vibrational transition.

Wait, maybe I should compute the momentum for the vibrational transition.

Earlier calculation gave p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why isn't the rotational transition considered? Because the problem may assume that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and the next state is the first vibrational excited state. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a photon that causes a transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which would require energy equal to the vibrational energy.

But another possibility is that the question is considering the molecule in the ground state of the rotation-vibration model, but the next state could be either a higher J or a higher v. The question asks for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy change is the rotational transition, which requires 9.2e-23 J, but since that doesn't match any option, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me compute ħ²/(I) again.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is approximately (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.208e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.920 * 1e-22 = 9.20e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So the energy is 9.2e-23 J. So the photon's momentum is 9.2e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't have anything near that. The lowest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is four orders of magnitude higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps the model being used is the non-rigid rotor model, which treats the bond length as variable. But I'm not sure if that affects the energy calculation for the transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon that causes a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first state with higher energy, which would be the vibrational first excited state, v=1, J=0. Because the rotational state would require less energy, but perhaps the selection rules don't allow simultaneous transitions.

Wait, but in reality, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can undergo a vibrational transition with a simultaneous rotational transition. The selection rules allow Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1.

So perhaps the photon's energy must account for both the vibrational and rotational change. But that would require calculating the sum of the two energies.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the minimal energy change. So if the vibrational transition requires more energy than the rotational, the minimal would be the rotational. But in this case, that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is considering a transition where the molecule goes to (v=1, J=0), which would require the vibrational energy.

Therefore, the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J, leading to p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So, despite the rotational transition requiring less energy, perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition as the answer because the rotational transition isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I confused the units for bond length. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass should be calculated differently. Wait, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) = (40 amu²) / 22 amu ) = 1.818 amu. Yes, that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should have used the wavenumbers instead of angular frequency, but I'm not sure that applies here.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is considering the vibrational transition, so the photon's energy is ħω, and the momentum is ħω/c.

So, let's compute that.

ω =4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

p= E_photon /c =4.218e-20 /3e8 ≈1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

That's option D.

So, given that the options don't have the rotational transition's momentum, I think the intended answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences associated with vibrational and rotational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}
  \]  
  Converting to kilograms:  
  \[
  \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)  

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
  \]

- **Vibrational angular frequency**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)  

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a vibrational transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a rotational transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\( 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)).  
- However, the problem specifies the "next state with the lowest possible energy," which could imply the vibrational transition if the rotational transition is not considered due to selection rules or model constraints.  

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:  
\[
p = \frac{E}{c}
\]
For the vibrational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
\]

This matches **Option D**. While the rotational transition requires less energy, its corresponding momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)) is not among the provided options. Thus, the problem likely expects the vibrational transition as the answer.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Alright, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Okay, the molecule is diatomic, made of elements X and Y. They give the masses as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from its fundamental state to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, when they say the fundamental state, I think that's the lowest energy state. So the molecule is in the ground state, and the photon is being absorbed to take it to the next higher state. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, each state is characterized by both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

Wait, the fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state, which is v=0. And the rotational state might be in the ground state as well, which is J=0. So the molecule is in the state (v=0, J=0). Now, when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition to a higher state. But the question is about the lowest possible energy change, so probably the photon will cause the molecule to increase in energy by the smallest possible amount.

Hmm, but wait, what are the possible transitions? I remember that in the rotational-vibrational spectrum, a photon can cause a simultaneous change in both rotational and vibrational states. But the selection rules for vibrational transitions are Δv = ±1, and for rotational, ΔJ = ±1. But since the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think it's about the first excited state. So the molecule would transition to v=1, J=0? Or maybe J increases by 1. Wait, wait, perhaps the question is about the next state in terms of energy, not necessarily a single quantum jump in either mode.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, but it can have different rotational states. Oh, right, the rotational states are quantized as well. So the ground state would have v=0 and J=0. The next state with the lowest energy could be v=0, J=1. Because increasing J by 1 would require less energy than increasing v by 1, since vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones.

Wait, let me think about the energy levels. The vibrational energy levels are given by Ev = (v + 1/2)ħω, while the rotational energy levels are EJ = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For a diatomic molecule, I is μ R², with μ being the reduced mass.

So the energy spacing for vibrational transitions is on the order of ħω, which is about 4e14 rad/s. But for rotational transitions, each step is (J+1)ħ²/(2I) - Jħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(2I) * (2J+1). Wait, but I think the energy between J and J+1 is proportional to J. So the energy difference for rotational transitions increases with J. So the first rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) would have a smaller energy than the first vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1).

Wait, but let's calculate the energies. Let's compare the energy needed to go from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), and from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0).

First, let's compute the vibrational energy difference. The energy change ΔE_vib is Ev = (v+1/2)ħω - (v +1/2)ħω, but wait, from v=0 to v=1 it's (1 + ½)ħω - (0 + ½)ħω = ħω. So ΔE_vib = ħω ≈ 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = about 2.65e-19 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1. The energy EJ is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So for J=0, E0=0. For J=1, E1 = (2ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I). So the energy difference is ħ²/(I). 

What is I, the moment of inertia? I = μ R². μ is the reduced mass. So μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let me compute that. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, and 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

But wait, R is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = ħ² / I. Let's compute that. ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Wait, wait, let me compute ħ² / I: 1.112e-68 / (1.208e-46) ≈ 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, that's way larger than the vibrational energy difference. Hmm, that suggests that the rotational transition requires way more energy than the vibrational. Wait, that can't be right. Because in reality, in infrared spectroscopy, rotational transitions often accompany vibrational transitions because the energy spacing for vibrations is much larger, and they allow rotational changes via the selection rules.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

So, let me recompute I. 

μ = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 1.81818... amu.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 kg.

1.81818 * 1.660539e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.8 * 1.66 is about 3, so 1.81818 * 1.66e-27 ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So R² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

Then, ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.208e-46) = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ approximately 0.920e-22 J, which is 9.2e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference is about 9.2e-23 J, and vibrational is 4e14 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ no, wait the vibrational energy per photon is ħω. Wait, ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ħω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * 4e14 rad/s ≈ 4.218e-20 J.

So the rotational transition (from J=0 to J=1) requires about 9.2e-23 J, which is less than the vibrational transition (4.2e-20 J). So why does the rotational transition require less energy? That makes sense because rotational energy levels are closer together.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that the rotational transition would be a smaller energy jump than the vibrational, so the photon would need to supply either one.

But the question is about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one that requires the least energy change.

Which one is lower? 9.2e-23 J is way smaller than 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon would have to match that.

Wait, but wait, can the molecule transition only to higher states via photon absorption? So, the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). When a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase v by one (v=1, J=0), or increase J by one (v=0, J=1), whichever requires less energy. Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, the photon would have to match that.

Wait, but wait, what if the molecule can only transition between certain states? Let me think about selection rules. For the rigid rotor-vibration model, the selection rules are Δv= ±1 for vibration, and ΔJ= ±1 for rotation. But for the non-rigid rotor, perhaps the selection rule for vibration is still Δv=±1, and rotation ΔJ=±1.

Wait, but in a diatomic molecule, the vibration is along the bond axis, and the rotation is perpendicular. So, the dipole transition for vibration would allow Δv=±1, and for rotation, ΔJ=±1. But in some cases, when a photon is absorbed, both changes can happen. For example, during a vibrational transition, rotational quantum numbers can change by ±1. So the photon's energy would have to account for both the vibrational and rotational changes.

Wait, but the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the photon momentum to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state could be either a higher rotational state (same v) or a higher vibrational state (same J). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, I think that's the way to go.

So the photon's energy should match the energy difference needed for the rotational transition.

So the energy of the photon would be E = ΔE_rot = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, I might have made a mistake earlier because the calculation for ΔE_rot seems extremely small. Let me check again.

Wait, the formula for rotational energy is E_J = (J (J+1) ħ²) / (2I). So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_1 - E_0.

E_1 = (1 * 2 ħ²)/(2I) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

E_0 is 0, so the energy difference is ħ²/(I).

Wait, so the energy difference is (1.05457e-34 J·s)^2 / (1.208e-46 kg m²).

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 = 1.112, so 1.112e-68 J² s².

Denominator: 1.208e-46 kg m².

So E = 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So the energy needed is 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Hmm. The momentum p of a photon is given by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light, because for photons, E=pc, so p = E/(c).

Alternatively, since E = hf = hc/λ, and p = E/c.

So, since E = 9.2e-23 J, then p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) )= 3.067e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 3e-31. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, but wait a second. Did I mix up the energy? Because if the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, then the momentum would be 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But 3e-31 kg·m/s is 3e-31 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, 3e-31 N·s isn't an option. So maybe I did something wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. Then the energy change is ΔE_vib = ħω, and since the rotational state doesn't change, the photon's energy is just that.

Let me compute that. ħω is (1.05457e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) = 4.218e-20 J.

So the momentum would be 4.218e-20 J / (3e8 m/s) )= 1.406e-28 kg·m/s, which is 1.4e-28 N·s. That's option D.

But earlier I thought that the rotational transition requires less energy, so why is the photon's energy higher in that case?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the transition. Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state is the one immediately above the current state, regardless of quantum numbers. Or perhaps the question is considering the first possible transition, which might involve both rotational and vibrational changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the model used here is the non-rigid rotor model, which treats the molecule as a 3D rotor with a vibrational parameter. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy levels in the non-rigid rotor model. The energy levels are given by:

E = E_vib + E_rot

E_vib = (v + 1/2) ħ ω

E_rot = (J (J+1) - J0 (J0 +1))/ (2k) ), where J0 is the rotational state at equilibrium bond length, and k is the rotational constant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1). So the energy change is purely rotational, which would require E_rot = 9.2e-23 J. But as I saw earlier, that leads to a momentum of about 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

That suggests that perhaps I should instead consider the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J, leading to p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Wait, but why would the rotational transition require a photon with a lower energy than the vibrational, yet the options don't have such a small p. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, wait another thing. Let me recheck the rotational energy calculation.

I think my mistake might be in the moment of inertia. Because I used I = μ R², but maybe R is the bond length, which is 2 angstroms. So let me recheck that.

μ is the reduced mass. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2 )/(20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.66e-27 kg, so μ ≈1.818 *1.66e-27 =3.02e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So I= μ R² =3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 =1.208e-46 kg m².

Then, the rotational energy E_J is (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2I).

So when J=0, E_J=0. When J=1, E_J= (2 * ħ² )/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So the energy difference is E_1 - E_0 = ħ²/(I).

So plugging in the numbers: ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.208e-46 kg m².

So E=1.112e-68 /1.208e-46 = approx 9.2e-23 J.

But when I calculate p=E/c, I get 9.2e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s = 3.07e-31 N s.

But the options are in the order of 1e-28 to 2e-27 N s. So this suggests that perhaps the problem is not about a pure rotational transition but a vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I have misunderstood the question. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state in the rotation-vibration spectrum is typically the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state (v=0, J=0). So the next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1.

If I'm considering the transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), then the energy required is 9.2e-23 J, which, as I found earlier, would correspond to a photon with momentum 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is looking for the vibrational transition, which would have a larger energy.

So, if the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J (from v=0 to v=1), the momentum would be 4.2e-20 /3e8 = 1.4e-28 kg m/s = 1.4e-28 Ns. That's option D.

But why would the next state with the lowest possible energy be a vibrational transition instead of a rotational one? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so it should be the next state.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rotational energy. Let me compute it more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the rotational energy is E = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I). So delta E is E(J+1) - E(J)= [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ] * ħ²/(2I) )= (2J+3) * ħ²/(2I).

Wait, for J=0: E1-E0 is ( (1*2) - (0) ) * ħ²/(2I) )= (2 * ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering rotational transitions because the model used is the non-rigid rotor model, which might treat the molecule as a 3D rotor, but I'm not sure if that affects the energy calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the transition from (v=0,J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which would require the photon's energy to be the vibrational energy.

So, let's compute the photon's momentum in that case.

E_photon = ħ ω = (1.05457e-34 J·s) * 4e14 rad/s = 4.218e-20 J.

So p = E_photon / c = 4.218e-20 / 3e8 = 1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 N·s.

Which matches option D. 1.4e-28 Ns.

But wait, why is the rotational transition (which requires less energy) not being considered? Because in reality, rotational transitions require less energy, so the next state should be the rotational one. But perhaps in this problem, the molecule's next available state is the vibrational transition because the rotational transitions are not allowed under the given model.

Wait, the question states the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor), which implies that both rotational and vibrational transitions are considered. So the next state could be the rotational one if that transition is allowed.

But in that case, the momentum would be 3e-31 Ns, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the problem considers only vibrational transitions, which would make option D the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Let me check the units again.

Wait, when calculating I, μ is in kg, R in meters, so I is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the bond length in the calculation, but maybe I forgot that the bond length is 2 angstroms. No, I used it correctly.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is the one with the smallest possible ΔE. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that would be the next state. So the photon's energy would be 9.2e-23 J, leading to p=3e-31 Ns, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the rotational energy in terms of angular frequency. Rotational energy levels are given by E_J = J (J+1) ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency.

Wait, but ω_rot is not given in the problem. Oh, right, the problem gives the vibrational angular frequency, w =4e14 rad/s. The rotational frequency is different and perhaps isn't provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy for the rotation is calculated using the moment of inertia.

Wait, the rotational energy levels can also be expressed using the rotational constant B, where B = ħ²/(2I c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2I).

Wait, but I think I did that correctly before.

So perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. But why? Because the rotational transition requires a lower energy, which would be the next state.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the molecule can only change its vibrational state, not rotational. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think: in the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, but if the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, the next state is a vibrational state, but perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of rotation and vibration, and the first excited state is the first vibrational state.

Hmm, but the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration spectrum is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational state.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the case where the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next possible state in energy could be (v=0, J=1), which is lower in energy than (v=1, J=0). So the molecule would first transition to (v=0, J=1), requiring a photon with energy 9.2e-23 J. However, since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects the photon to cause a vibrational transition.

Wait, maybe I should compute the momentum for the vibrational transition.

Earlier calculation gave p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why isn't the rotational transition considered? Because the problem may assume that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and the next state is the first vibrational excited state. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a photon that causes a transition from (v=0, J=0) to (v=1, J=0), which would require energy equal to the vibrational energy.

But another possibility is that the question is considering the molecule in the ground state of the rotation-vibration model, but the next state could be either a higher J or a higher v. The question asks for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy change is the rotational transition, which requires 9.2e-23 J, but since that doesn't match any option, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me compute ħ²/(I) again.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² is approximately (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

I is 1.208e-46 kg m².

So ħ² / I ≈ 1.112e-68 / 1.208e-46 = (1.112 / 1.208) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.920 * 1e-22 = 9.20e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So the energy is 9.2e-23 J. So the photon's momentum is 9.2e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options don't have anything near that. The lowest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is four orders of magnitude higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps the model being used is the non-rigid rotor model, which treats the bond length as variable. But I'm not sure if that affects the energy calculation for the transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the photon that causes a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first state with higher energy, which would be the vibrational first excited state, v=1, J=0. Because the rotational state would require less energy, but perhaps the selection rules don't allow simultaneous transitions.

Wait, but in reality, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can undergo a vibrational transition with a simultaneous rotational transition. The selection rules allow Δv=±1 and ΔJ=±1.

So perhaps the photon's energy must account for both the vibrational and rotational change. But that would require calculating the sum of the two energies.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so the minimal energy change. So if the vibrational transition requires more energy than the rotational, the minimal would be the rotational. But in this case, that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is considering a transition where the molecule goes to (v=1, J=0), which would require the vibrational energy.

Therefore, the photon's energy is 4.2e-20 J, leading to p=1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

So, despite the rotational transition requiring less energy, perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition as the answer because the rotational transition isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I confused the units for bond length. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass should be calculated differently. Wait, μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) ) = (40 amu²) / 22 amu ) = 1.818 amu. Yes, that's correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should have used the wavenumbers instead of angular frequency, but I'm not sure that applies here.

Wait, another approach: maybe the question is considering the vibrational transition, so the photon's energy is ħω, and the momentum is ħω/c.

So, let's compute that.

ω =4e14 rad/s.

So E_photon = ħ ω = 1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

p= E_photon /c =4.218e-20 /3e8 ≈1.406e-28 kg m/s = 1.406e-28 Ns.

That's option D.

So, given that the options don't have the rotational transition's momentum, I think the intended answer is D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences associated with vibrational and rotational transitions.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}
  \]  
  Converting to kilograms:  
  \[
  \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)  

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
  \]

- **Vibrational angular frequency**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)  

### Energy Transitions:
1. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a vibrational transition from \( v = 0 \) to \( v = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
   \]

2. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The energy difference for a rotational transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \) is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.208 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]

### Analysis:
- The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\( 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( 4.218 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)).  
- However, the problem specifies the "next state with the lowest possible energy," which could imply the vibrational transition if the rotational transition is not considered due to selection rules or model constraints.  

### Photon Momentum:
The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by:  
\[
p = \frac{E}{c}

For the vibrational transition:  
\[
p = \frac{4.218 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.406 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
\]

This matches **Option D**. While the rotational transition requires less energy, its corresponding momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)) is not among the provided options. Thus, the problem likely expects the vibrational transition as the answer.

### Conclusion:
The photon's momentum required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy, as per the given options, is:  
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Answer: D
