Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: For a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, with small values of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) and B=1 T, compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom that has a wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. The options are A to D, involving whether the expectation value H is much larger, much smaller, etc., than ΔE.

Hmm, I think I remember that paramagnetic coupling refers to the interaction between the magnetic moments of electrons and an external magnetic field. The term is usually part of the Hamiltonian in quantum mechanics when dealing with magnetic fields.

The paramagnetic term is probably the Zeeman term, which is the energy due to the interaction of the magnetic moment with the external field. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is given by something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ is proportional to the spin and orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but wait. Since m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and the orbital part contributes to the magnetic moment. Oh, but wait, orbital contribution is usually considered in the Zeeman effect, while the paramagnetic effect is mainly due to the spin, I think. Or maybe this is the orbital contribution. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify that.

Wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism is about the spin magnetic moments, right? Because paramagnetism arises from the electron's spin, not the orbital angular momentum. But wait, the orbital contribution is diamagnetic, isn't it? So maybe the paramagnetic term here refers to the spin part.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels due to an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = (e/(2m_e c)) * B · (L + 2S), where L is the orbital angular momentum and S is the spin. The coefficient e/(2m_e c) gives the gyromagnetic ratio, but I think for electrons, the orbital part has a factor of 1, and the spin part has a factor of 2, leading to the L and 2S terms.

But if the magnetic field is weak, or if the quantum number m is small, perhaps the coupling term is the spin part. Because when m (the orbital quantum number) is small, the orbital contribution might be negligible. Wait, but orbital angular momentum quantum number is l, and m is its z-component. Hmm, wait no: the orbital magnetic quantum number is m_l, which can range from -l to +l. So if m is small, perhaps l is small, like maybe l=0, 1, or something like that. But wait, the problem says the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Oh wait, no, the orbital magnetic number is m_l, but the spin magnetic number is m_s, which can be ±1/2. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the problem states "small values of m", and given that m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which is m_l, which can be -l, ..., +l. So if m is small, maybe l is small, like l=0 or 1, which is the s or p orbital.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's break down the problem.

We have to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy is given by the wavelength λ=0.4861 μm, which is the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=2 to n=1. Wait, no, wait: H-alpha is from n=2 to n=1? Or wait, no, I think it's from n=3 to n=2. Because 0.486 μm is the wavelength, which corresponds to about 656 nm. Hmm, wait, no, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is blue-green, but H-alpha is about 656 nm. Oh, wait, maybe I got confused. So the wavelength given is 0.4861 μm, which is about 486 nm. That's near the violet part of the visible spectrum. Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the energy of the transition.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Let me compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 m.

So ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = (1.9878e-25) / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.088e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, actually, that's the energy of a single photon. For the hydrogen atom transition, the energy levels are quantized, and the transition energy is the difference between two levels. Let me calculate that.

The Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R_H is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. But perhaps, given that they've provided the wavelength, I can just compute the energy as I did before.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the energy in terms of electron volts. Let's see, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J is about 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that's high. Wait, but the Balmer series transitions are lower in energy. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from n=1 to n=2. The energy levels for hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So, for n=1, E=-13.6 eV; for n=2, E=-3.4 eV. The transition energy ΔE would be the difference, which is 10.2 eV. So the photon emitted has energy 10.2 eV, wavelength λ. Let me compute that wavelength.

E_photon = hc/λ. So λ = hc/(E_photon). Let me compute hc in eV·nm.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Convert to eV·nm:

1.9878e-25 J·m = (1.9878e-25 J·m) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) * (1e9 nm/m) )= (1.9878e-25 / 1.602e-19) eV·nm = approximately 1.24e-6 eV·nm, which is 1240 eV·nm.

So, E_photon (in eV) = 1240 nm·eV / λ (in nm).

For the transition energy ΔE=10.2 eV, λ=1240 /10.2 ≈121 nm. Hmm, which is in the UV range. But the problem says λ=0.4861 μm, which is 486 nm, which is about 2.14 eV (since 1240 /486 ≈2.55 eV, but wait, that would be for a photon of that wavelength. Oh wait, previous calculation I got 4.088e-19 J = 2.55 eV. So the transition energy is 2.55 eV? Wait, but according to hydrogen energy levels, the transition from n=2 to n=1 is 10.2 eV, which gives λ≈121 nm. So why is the given wavelength 486 nm? Oh wait, perhaps the problem refers to a different transition.

Wait, 486 nm is about 2.55 eV, which would correspond to a transition from n=3 to n=2: E3 = -13.6/9 ≈-1.51 eV; E2=-3.4 eV. So ΔE=1.89 eV. Hmm, but 1240/486 ≈ 2.55 eV. So maybe it's a different transition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem gives λ=0.4861 μm, so let's compute ΔE as hc/λ, which is approximately 2.55 eV.

Now, the other term is the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the Zeeman energy. So the paramagnetic coupling term is the energy due to the interaction of the electron's spin with the magnetic field.

The Zeeman energy for spin is given by E = μ_B * B * m_s, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number (±1/2).

Wait, but in this problem, they're talking about the orbital magnetic quantum number m being small. Wait, but orbital magnetic quantum number is m_l, which can be up to l. So perhaps the orbital contribution is negligible, and we're considering only the spin contribution. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the paramagnetic term as the spin part.

So, let's compute the paramagnetic energy term. The Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So E_spin = μ_B * B * m_s. Since m_s is ±1/2, the maximum value is (9.274e-24 J/T) * (1 T) * (1/2) = 4.637e-24 J. Which is about 2.9 eV, since 1 eV=1.6e-19 J. So 4.6e-24 J is about 4.6e-24 /1.6e-19 ≈ 2.875e-5 eV, which is 0.00002875 eV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 4.6e-24 J is much smaller than the transition energy of 2.55 eV.

Wait, let me recalculate. 4.637e-24 J is how much in eV?

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 4.637e-24 J is (4.637e-24) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 2.895e-5 eV. So about 2.9e-5 eV, which is 0.000029 eV.

The transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV (from earlier calculation). So the paramagnetic term is about 1e-5 times smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Hydrogen's energy levels are on the order of eV, while the Zeeman effect is much smaller. So the paramagnetic term (Zeeman) is much smaller than the transition energy. So in this case, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than ΔE.

So the paramagnetic term is ⟨H⟩ = Zeeman energy, which is about 3e-5 eV, and ΔE is 2.55 eV. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

So the answer would be option C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Because orbital m is small. So orbital contribution might be important?

Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (μ_B) (l (l+1) )^0.5 (m_l / l ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is given by μ_L = (μ_B) * m_l * sqrt( (l)(l+1) ) ) / l ?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the orbital contribution in the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian includes both orbital and spin terms. But in the problem, it says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism comes from the spin, while the orbital effect is diamagnetic, I think. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is the spin part, and the orbital is separate.

Wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term", which is probably the spin term, so that's where the energy comes from. So the spin part is μ·B, which is μ_B * B * m_s. As I calculated, that's about 3e-5 eV, which is way smaller than ΔE=2.55 eV.

So in that case, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy. So the correct option is C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energies.

### Transition Energy ΔE
The wavelength of the transition is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the energy of the photon is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.088 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.088 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's spin magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. The energy is given by:

\[
E_{\text{spin}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m_s,
\]

where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength, and \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) is the spin magnetic quantum number. Substituting the values:

\[
E_{\text{spin}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \approx 4.637 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
E_{\text{spin}} \approx \frac{4.637 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.895 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Comparison
The paramagnetic coupling term \( E_{\text{spin}} \approx 2.9 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \) is approximately \( 10^5 \) times smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \). Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

### Conclusion
The correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \)**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: For a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis, with small values of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number) and B=1 T, compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom that has a wavelength λ=0.4861 μm.

We have to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition energy is given by the wavelength λ=0.4861 μm, which is the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=2 to n=1. Wait, no, wait: H-alpha is from n=2 to n=1? Or wait, no, I think it's from n=3 to n=2. Because 0.486 μm is the wavelength, which corresponds to about 656 nm. Hmm, wait, no, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is blue-green, but H-alpha is about 656 nm. Oh, wait, maybe I got confused. So the wavelength given is 0.4861 μm, which is about 486 nm. That's near the violet part of the visible spectrum. Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the energy of the transition.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Let me compute that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. λ = 0.4861 μm = 0.4861e-6 m.

So ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = (1.9878e-25) / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.088e-19 J.

Wait, but wait, actually, that's the energy of a single photon. For the hydrogen atom transition, the energy levels are quantized, and the transition energy is the difference between two levels. Let me calculate that.

The Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R_H (1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R_H is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. But perhaps, given that they've provided the wavelength, I can just compute the energy as I did before.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the energy in terms of electron volts. Let's see, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J is about 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait, that's high. Wait, but the Balmer series transitions are lower in energy. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from n=1 to n=2. The energy levels for hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So, for n=1, E=-13.6 eV; for n=2, E=-3.4 eV. The transition energy ΔE would be the difference, which is 10.2 eV. So the photon emitted has energy 10.2 eV, wavelength λ. Let me compute that wavelength.

E_photon = hc/λ. So λ = hc/(E_photon). Let me compute hc in eV·nm.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Convert to eV·nm:

1.9878e-25 J·m = (1.9878e-25 J·m) * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) * (1e9 nm/m) )= (1.9878e-25 / 1.602e-19) eV·nm = approximately 1.24e-6 eV·nm, which is 1240 eV·nm.

So, E_photon (in eV) = 1240 nm·eV / λ (in nm).

For the transition energy ΔE=10.2 eV, λ=1240 /10.2 ≈121 nm. Hmm, which is in the UV range. But the problem says λ=0.4861 μm, which is 486 nm, which is about 2.14 eV (since 1240 /486 ≈2.55 eV, but wait, that would be for a photon of that wavelength. Oh wait, previous calculation I got 4.088e-19 J = 2.55 eV. So the transition energy is 2.55 eV? Wait, but according to hydrogen energy levels, the transition from n=2 to n=1 is 10.2 eV, which gives λ≈121 nm. So why is the given wavelength 486 nm? Oh wait, perhaps the problem refers to a different transition.

Wait, 486 nm is about 2.55 eV, which would correspond to a transition from n=3 to n=2: E3 = -13.6/9 ≈-1.51 eV; E2=-3.4 eV. So ΔE=1.89 eV. Hmm, but 1240/486 ≈ 2.55 eV. So maybe it's a different transition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem gives λ=0.4861 μm, so let's compute ΔE as hc/λ, which is approximately 2.55 eV.

Now, the other term is the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the Zeeman energy. So the paramagnetic coupling term is the energy due to the interaction of the electron's spin with the magnetic field.

The Zeeman energy for spin is given by E = μ_B * B * m_s, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number (±1/2).

Wait, but in this problem, they're talking about the orbital magnetic quantum number m being small. Wait, but orbital magnetic quantum number is m_l, which can be up to l. So perhaps the orbital contribution is negligible, and we're considering only the spin contribution. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the paramagnetic term as the spin part.

So, let's compute the paramagnetic energy term. The Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So E_spin = μ_B * B * m_s. Since m_s is ±1/2, the maximum value is (9.274e-24 J/T) * (1 T) * (1/2) = 4.637e-24 J. Which is about 2.9 eV, since 1 eV=1.6e-19 J. So 4.6e-24 J is about 4.6e-24 /1.6e-19 ≈ 2.875e-5 eV, which is 0.00002875 eV.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 4.6e-24 J is much smaller than the transition energy of 2.55 eV.

Wait, let me recalculate. 4.637e-24 J is how much in eV?

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 4.637e-24 J is (4.637e-24) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 2.895e-5 eV. So about 2.9e-5 eV, which is 0.000029 eV.

The transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV (from earlier calculation). So the paramagnetic term is about 1e-5 times smaller than ΔE.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Hydrogen's energy levels are on the order of eV, while the Zeeman effect is much smaller. So the paramagnetic term (Zeeman) is much smaller than the transition energy. So in this case, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than ΔE.

So the paramagnetic term is ⟨H⟩ = Zeeman energy, which is about 3e-5 eV, and ΔE is 2.55 eV. So ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

So the answer would be option C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Because orbital m is small. So orbital contribution might be important?

Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (μ_B) (l (l+1) )^0.5 (m_l / l ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is given by μ_L = (μ_B) * m_l * sqrt( (l)(l+1) ) ) / l ?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the orbital contribution in the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian includes both orbital and spin terms. But in the problem, it says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism comes from the spin, while the orbital effect is diamagnetic, I think. So perhaps the paramagnetic term is the spin part, and the orbital is separate.

Wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term", which is probably the spin term, so that's where the energy comes from. So the spin part is μ·B, which is μ_B * B * m_s. As I calculated, that's about 3e-5 eV, which is way smaller than ΔE=2.55 eV.

So in that case, the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy. So the correct option is C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energies.

### Transition Energy ΔE
The wavelength of the transition is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the energy of the photon is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.088 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.088 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the electron's spin magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. The energy is given by:

\[
E_{\text{spin}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m_s,
\]

where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength, and \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) is the spin magnetic quantum number. Substituting the values:

\[
E_{\text{spin}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \approx 4.637 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
E_{\text{spin}} \approx \frac{4.637 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.895 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Comparison
The paramagnetic coupling term \( E_{\text{spin}} \approx 2.9 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \) is approximately \( 10^5 \) times smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \). Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

### Conclusion
The correct option is:

**C) \( \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E \)**.

Answer: C
