Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through step by step.

So, the question says we have two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l equal to 1, right? So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The state they're in is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the probability that both measurements give -ħ. That is, the eigenvalues are -ħ for both L1z and L2z.

First, I remember that the orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is given by Lz, and its eigenvalues are mħ for each particle, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So each electron's Lz can be -1ħ, 0, or +1ħ because l=1.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled angular momentum state. I think this is a state where the two individual angular momenta are combined. The total angular momentum L is the sum of L1 and L2. So, l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Here, since both l1 and l2 are 1, l can be 0, 1, or 2.

But our state is in the l=2 multiplet. For l=2, the possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. But our state has m=-1.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum. So we're only considering the orbital part here.

Now, when we have two particles, their state can be expressed in terms of their individual states. But the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the individual states. So the question is, in this coupled state, what is the probability that each electron has m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, because when they add to m=-1.

Wait, because the total m is m1 + m2. So if the total m is -1, the possible combinations for m1 and m2 would be pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, for two electrons, each with m1 and m2, the possible pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.

But wait, can that be right? Because each m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that add to m_total = -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), and maybe is there another possibility? Let's see: (-1,0) gives -1, (0,-1) gives -1, and wait, can (-2, +1) be a possibility? No, because each m is limited to -1, 0, +1 for l=1. So the only possibilities are m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

Wait, but wait a second. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific combined state. The question is, what is the probability that when we measure each electron's L_z, we get m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because the question says the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. Oh! Wait, no: wait, the eigenvalues are -ħ for each. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L_z eigenvalues are mħ. So each m is -1.

Wait, but m1 + m2 would then be -2. But the total m in the state is -1. So that's a problem. Because if m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, their sum is -2, but the state has m = -1. So that's impossible.

Wait, that would mean that the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include the case where both m1 and m2 are -1, because their sum can't be -1 in that case. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Ah, so that's why the probability is zero. Because in the coupled state with m=-1, the individual m's cannot both be -1. Because their sum would be -2, which doesn't match the m of the state.

So, the probability is zero. So the correct answer is D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ with eigenvalues $-\hbar$ (i.e., $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$).

The orbital angular momentum in the $z$-direction has eigenvalues $m\hbar$, where $m$ can take values $-l, -l+1, \dots, l$ for each particle. For $l_1 = l_2 = 1$, the possible $m$ values for each electron are $-1, 0, +1$. The total $m$ of the system is the sum of the individual $m$ values: $m = m_1 + m_2$. In the given state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the total $m$ is $-1$, so the possible pairs of $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

However, the question asks for the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. If both $m_1$ and $m_2$ were $-1$, their sum would be $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$ of the state. Therefore, the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ does not include the case where both $m_1$ and $m_2$ are $-1$. 

Since this scenario is impossible, the joint probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is $0$.

Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through step by step.

So, the question says we have two electrons in p orbitals. Each p orbital has an angular momentum quantum number l equal to 1, right? So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The state they're in is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the probability that both measurements give -ħ. That is, the eigenvalues are -ħ for both L1z and L2z.

First, I remember that the orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is given by Lz, and its eigenvalues are mħ for each particle, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So each electron's Lz can be -1ħ, 0, or +1ħ because l=1.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled angular momentum state. I think this is a state where the two individual angular momenta are combined. The total angular momentum L is the sum of L1 and L2. So, l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Here, since both l1 and l2 are 1, l can be 0, 1, or 2.

But our state is in the l=2 multiplet. For l=2, the possible m values are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. But our state has m=-1.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum. So we're only considering the orbital part here.

Now, when we have two particles, their state can be expressed in terms of their individual states. But the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the individual states. So the question is, in this coupled state, what is the probability that each electron has m1 = -1 and m2 = 0, because when they add to m=-1.

Wait, because the total m is m1 + m2. So if the total m is -1, the possible combinations for m1 and m2 would be pairs where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, for two electrons, each with m1 and m2, the possible pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.

But wait, can that be right? Because each m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that add to m_total = -1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), and maybe is there another possibility? Let's see: (-1,0) gives -1, (0,-1) gives -1, and wait, can (-2, +1) be a possibility? No, because each m is limited to -1, 0, +1 for l=1. So the only possibilities are m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

Wait, but wait a second. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific combined state. The question is, what is the probability that when we measure each electron's L_z, we get m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because the question says the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. Oh! Wait, no: wait, the eigenvalues are -ħ for each. So m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L_z eigenvalues are mħ. So each m is -1.

Wait, but m1 + m2 would then be -2. But the total m in the state is -1. So that's a problem. Because if m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, their sum is -2, but the state has m = -1. So that's impossible.

Wait, that would mean that the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include the case where both m1 and m2 are -1, because their sum can't be -1 in that case. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Ah, so that's why the probability is zero. Because in the coupled state with m=-1, the individual m's cannot both be -1. Because their sum would be -2, which doesn't match the m of the state.

So, the probability is zero. So the correct answer is D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described by $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the total magnetic quantum number. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ with eigenvalues $-\hbar$ (i.e., $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$).

The orbital angular momentum in the $z$-direction has eigenvalues $m\hbar$, where $m$ can take values $-l, -l+1, \dots, l$ for each particle. For $l_1 = l_2 = 1$, the possible $m$ values for each electron are $-1, 0, +1$. The total $m$ of the system is the sum of the individual $m$ values: $m = m_1 + m_2$. In the given state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the total $m$ is $-1$, so the possible pairs of $(m_1, m_2)$ that satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$ are:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

However, the question asks for the probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. If both $m_1$ and $m_2$ were $-1$, their sum would be $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$ of the state. Therefore, the state $|1,1,2,-1>$ does not include the case where both $m_1$ and $m_2$ are $-1$. 

Since this scenario is impossible, the joint probability of measuring $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$ is $0$.
