Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and dibromide would have bromine atoms at 1 and 3 positions. Heating with KOH sounds like an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, since it's dibromide, perhaps two eliminations happen.

Wait, but when you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo), treatment with a strong base like KOH usually leads to elimination, forming an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on 1 and 3, which are across each other on the adamantane structure. Hmm. So maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, but KOH could deprotonate a beta hydrogen and eliminate HBr twice. But in adamantane, the structure is quite rigid. So perhaps each elimination forms a double bond. Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which sounds like a conjugated diene maybe, or perhaps just a single alkene.

Looking at the NMR data: the product has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where an ether or an alcohol's proton might be. Or maybe it's an epoxide, but that's usually around 4.5-4.7 with two protons. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit upfield for an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, like an oxygen connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a diol. Because when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially under certain conditions, it can form a diol via an SN2 mechanism. But wait, for vicinal dihalides, that's more common. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane—maybe it's a diastereomer that allows for such a reaction. But adamantane is a very rigid structure, so the bromines are probably in axial positions.

Wait, wait, when dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoethane) are treated with KOH, maybe they form a 1,2-ethene via elimination. But in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in a ring structure. So perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, the product is a diol, perhaps. Because sometimes, when the base is in excess and conditions are such, the dihalide can undergo a substitution twice, leading to a diol.

Wait, but the product is formed when heated with KOH. So maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that suggest an alkene. Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe the product isn't a diol but something with a carbonyl group.

Wait, if it's a carbonyl, then maybe it's an epoxide ring opening or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but let me think again. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Let me imagine the structure. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. Maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene? But if that's the case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, so maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a substitution. For each Br, it could replace with an OH group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-diol. But in that case, the NMR would show peaks for the OH groups, but the product is a solid, which might indicate it's not a diol because diols are usually more polar and would have broad OH peaks in NMR. But wait, the NMR given doesn't have any broad peaks; it's all sharp signals. So maybe the OH groups deprotonate, but in the NMR, they might not be present. Or perhaps they are in a different environment.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong. That's about where esters, ketones, or maybe an aldehyde's carbonyl appears. Esters are around 1740-1710, ketones at 1700-1750. So maybe the product is a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then the IR would show a C-O-C peak around 1250 cm-1, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, another possibility: if the reaction is an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not carbonyl groups. Unless it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that's not a typical reaction for vicinal dihalides. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a case of the formation of a diketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each bromine is replaced by an oxygen-containing group. Wait, but KOH is a base, so perhaps it's forming a crown ether or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Let me think of the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would make a diol. But the IR doesn't show an OH stretch; instead, it's a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each bromine, leading to the formation of an alkoxide, which then eliminates HBr, forming a double bond. But wait, that would produce an alkene, not a carbonyl. Unless it's a conjugated diene, but again, the IR doesn't show that.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone. Wait, but that would require some kind of ring contraction or expansion, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a diene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe it's an OCH2 group. Like an ether or an epoxide. Wait, but in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm. 4.79 is a bit upfield for an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with some neighboring protons. But wait, the 4.79 ppm is for 2H, perhaps two protons adjacent to an oxygen. Let me think: in a diol, maybe the two OH groups would be on adjacent carbons, but then the other protons would be in different regions.

Wait, maybe it's an ether. Like, two CH2-O groups. But then why is there a carbonyl in the IR?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but with a carbonyl group elsewhere. That's confusing.

Wait, another approach: what's the product when a dihalide reacts with KOH? Oh! Wait, maybe it's the formation of a diol via substitution. Each Br is replaced by an OH group. But that would make 1,3-diol. Then, what's the NMR of that?

In that case, the diol would have two OH groups. But in the NMR provided, there's no broad peak around 1-5 ppm, which would be expected for OH protons. So maybe the diol is deprotonated, but under the reaction conditions, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, maybe the diol is further reacting.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the diol undergoes some kind of oxidation, but the reaction conditions are KOH and heat. Hmm, not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is forming an acetal or something else, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial product. Let's think again: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. Perhaps each Br leaves as Br- and forms a carbocation, but that's unlikely in a rigid adamantane structure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to elimination, forming a double bond. But with two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur, leading to two double bonds or one conjugated diene.

Wait, but the product's IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe each elimination forms a ketone. But that doesn't make sense because elimination usually leads to alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another idea: the base could cause a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, if you have a vicinal dihalide, and you eliminate two HX molecules, you can form a double bond. But in this case, perhaps the structure allows for the formation of a ketone if the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a bromide oxide, which could then eliminate to form a carbonyl. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I don't think that would give a carbonyl IR peak. Epoxides have C-O-C, which absorbs around 1250 cm⁻¹, but the IR here is 1720, which is more for a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how would that form from a dihalide? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether with an adjacent carbonyl group. Like, for example, if two OH groups form, but then perhaps some kind of hemiacetal or acetal formation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen atom, leading to an epoxide. But then the structure would have an epoxide ring, but I'm not sure that fits the NMR.

Wait, maybe the initial product is 1,3-adamantanediol. So, after substitution, each Br is replaced by OH. Then, the product is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid and can catalyze various reactions, like Friedel-Crafts, but in the presence of an alcohol, perhaps it forms an acetal or something else.

Wait, but after that, the product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis is used to cleave alkenes. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So, putting this all together: product 1 is perhaps a diol, which then reacts with Al(i-Pr)3 to form an ether or some other structure with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

Wait, but let me go step by step.

Product 1: initial reaction with KOH. The IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone or ester. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm, 2H. Maybe this is an OCH2 group. Wait, another possibility is that product 1 is a diol with an adjacent carbonyl group. Or perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is not substitution but elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form 1,3-diene, but that's unlikely due to the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a conjugated diene.

Wait, but then the IR would show C=C peaks around 1650 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an ether oxygen. Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a ketone. Let's say each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that's not how substitution works. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates a hydrogen, and the bromide leaves, leading to formation of an oxide, which then loses another proton to form a carbonyl. Hmm, that could be possible.

Wait, for example, if each Br is on a secondary carbon, and when the base abstracts a proton, the Br leaves as Br⁻, forming a carbocation. But in adamantane, the carbocation would be very stable. Then, another deprotonation and elimination could form a double bond, but then again, why the carbonyl?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Al(i-Pr)3 is a strong Lewis acid and is used in various reactions, such as the formation of acetonides (acetals) from ketones and diols. So if product 1 has a ketone, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might form an acetal. Because acetals are formed by the reaction of ketones or aldehydes with diols or other alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts.

Wait, but product 1's IR has a carbonyl peak, so maybe it's a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 would be an acetal formed by reacting the ketone with a diol in the presence of Al(i-Pr)3 as a catalyst. So the product 2 would be an acetal, which would have an ether linkage.

But then, when product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, ozone would react with any double bonds. So for ozonolysis to occur, product 2 must have a double bond. Wait, but acetals are ethers; they don't have double bonds. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not a ketone but an epoxide. Then, product 2, after reaction with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps opens the epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it forms an acetal from a ketone. But then where's the ketone coming from? Maybe product 1 is a diol adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acetal. But then product 2 wouldn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acetal (which is an ether), then product 3 after ozonolysis wouldn't have any double bonds. But the question says that ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2, which suggests that product 2 has a double bond.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's try a different approach.

Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into carbonyl compounds. So product 3 would be the result of breaking a double bond into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, thinking back, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(i-Pr)3. If product 1 is a diol, perhaps the Al(i-Pr)3 helps it eliminate water, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Wait, that makes more sense. So product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination (dehydration) of the diol. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So let's piece it together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (diol, 1,3-adamantanediol)
2. product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (an alkene formed by elimination of water)
3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, product 3's NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. We are to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near the carbonyl group because deshielding occurs in such environments.

In ozonolysis, the alkene is cleaved, and each carbonyl group is formed on each fragment. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl (α-protons) would couple with neighboring hydrogens.

But in this case, the structure of product 3 depends on the structure of product 2, which is an alkene. So let's think about product 2.

Product 2 is formed by treating product 1 (diol) with Al(i-Pr)3. The diol is 1,3-adamantanediol. Heating with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3 would promote dehydration, forming an alkene. So the diol would lose water to form an alkene.

But in adamantane, the structure is rigid. So the diol has hydroxyl groups on carbons 1 and 3. Elimination would require the loss of a water molecule from adjacent carbons. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent; they're separated by one carbon (since it’s 1,3-diol). So elimination would require the loss of a water from each adjacent to each OH group.

Wait, no. Wait, in 1,3-adamantanediol, the two OH groups are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. So when heated with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, it could abstract a proton β to each OH, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Or maybe another pair of carbons.

Wait, but in the adamantane structure, each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond-like lattice. So when the diol loses two water molecules, it forms a double bond. Let me imagine the structure: if the diol is on carbons 1 and 3, elimination could form a double bond between 1 and 2 or between 3 and 4, but I'm not sure about the exact positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but more likely, it's a single double bond. So product 2 would be 1,2-adamantadiene or something similar.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a diene would produce multiple carbonyl groups. But perhaps in this case, the diene is in a position that when ozonolyzed, it breaks into smaller fragments.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is in a position that upon ozonolysis, each end becomes a carbonyl group, and the structure of product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent protons.

So, after ozonolysis, each of the carbonyl groups would have adjacent hydrogens. The most deshielded hydrogens would be the ones adjacent to the carbonyl.

In the NMR, these protons would typically be deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group. Their coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring hydrogens.

If each carbonyl group is adjacent to a CH2 group, then each CH2 would be split into a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a mono-alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. But if the alkene is symmetric, the products would be the same on both sides.

Assuming the double bond is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would yield two carbonyls each attached to a CH2 group. So each CH2 would have two protons. These protons would each be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In such a case, each CH2 group's protons would be split based on their neighboring groups. Let's say each CH2 is next to another CH2 group. Then, each proton would be split by coupling with two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling would be between protons on adjacent CH2 groups. Each proton on a CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each proton would have a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a triplet.

Alternatively, considering the typical splitting when two neighboring groups are present: each CH2 group is split by the adjacent CH2. Each H on a CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent group (like a vicinal coupling), leading to a triplet. But wait, each H is also coupled with another H on the same CH2, but that's geminal and doesn't split the peak in 1H NMR.

So, each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would cause each H to be a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet for each H.

Wait, but wait, in this scenario, each CH2 has two Hs, and each H is coupling with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But in reality, each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group. So for each proton, the coupling would be with two Hs (from each adjacent CH2), which would lead to a more complex splitting.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the structure is something like CH2-CO and another CH2-CO, connected by the ozonolysis cleavage. No, wait, ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is two carbonyl groups connected to CH2 groups, which are in turn connected to the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis produces two smaller molecules, each with a carbonyl group. But given that the starting material was an adamantane derivative, the product might have multiple rings but with cleaved double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis of a single double bond in a symmetric structure would produce two identical carbonyl compounds.

But let's get back to the NMR part. The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, the H closest to the carbonyl group would be the most deshielded. The splitting would be due to coupling with neighboring Hs.

If the structure is such that each H is adjacent to a CH2 group, then each H would have coupling with two Hs on each neighboring group. Wait, for example, if it's a structure like (CH2)CO, but that's not exactly right.

Wait, perhaps each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, and those CH2 groups are next to each other. So, the structure might be CH2-CO-CH2-CO. But when ozone is used, it breaks the double bond, so perhaps the structure is more like two CO groups connected by CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe each carbonyl is part of a ring, which would restrict the movement of the protons. But I'm not entirely sure.

But focusing on the coupling pattern: if each H is adjacent to two other Hs (on the same CH2), but also next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have n+1 peaks, where n is the number of neighboring Hs. So if each H is next to two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. But wait, each H is also coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the total coupling would be for each H to have two neighboring Hs, leading to (2+1)=3, a triplet. But wait, if each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group, that would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Oh wait, no, because the Hs on the same CH2 are geminal and don't split each other. So each H only couples with the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

If each H is coupled with two Hs (from the adjacent CH2), then each H would be a triplet.

But wait, let me think of a simple example. Imagine a structure like CH2-CH2, connected to carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet.

But in reality, the splitting might be more complex if there are more adjacent Hs. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and two Hs from another, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another possibility: if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, but that's not possible because each H is on a CH2, which is connected to the carbonyl. So each H would only have coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But another factor: the Hs on the same CH2 are equivalent, so the splitting might be a triplet for each H.

Wait, but what if the adjacent group is a CH2 with two Hs, and each H is coupled with both of them? The coupling would be (n+1), where n=2, so triplet.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and another two from the other, but that might not be the case here.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is between the Hs on both sides. Let's say each H is next to two Hs on one side and another two on the other. But in reality, each H would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs, so the pattern is a triplet.

But looking at the answer options, option A is triplet, B is triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent group and another two on another adjacent group, leading to a more complex splitting. For example, if each H is coupled with two Hs on the left and two on the right, that would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no, because each H can only couple with the Hs on adjacent carbons. Let's imagine a structure where each CH2 is connected to another CH2 on both sides. For example, a chain like CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, no, because ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, so the product would have carbonyl groups at each end.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think of the splitting as a triplet because each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent group.

Wait, but wait: if each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group, but that's not possible because each H is on a CH2 which is only adjacent to one other CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent group. So the splitting would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two on the other, but that would require each CH2 being adjacent to two other CH2 groups, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 on each side. For example, in a cyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product after ozonolysis is a diketone, where each ketone has adjacent CH2 groups. So the structure would be something like (CH2)2CO. But no, that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, and these CH2 groups are adjacent to each other. So the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CO, but connected to the adamantane structure. But ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups, each connected to CH2 groups.

In such a case, each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, but the same CH2 Hs are geminal, so they don't split each other. So each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two Hs on the other. But that would require each CH2 being adjacent to two other CH2 groups, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, and each H is coupled with two Hs on that adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Hmm, I think I'm going around in circles. Let's try to think of a simpler structure. Suppose product 2 is 1,2-diene, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

After ozonolysis, each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would be coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, the NMR would show a triplet for those Hs. So looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom. So perhaps in product 3, the most deshielded Hs are on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each of these Hs would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the Hs are adjacent to more than one set of Hs, the coupling could be more complex. For example, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two on the other, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are coupled with two Hs from each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to geminal diols, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the reasoning that each H is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group, the splitting would be a triplet.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in the formation of 1,3-adamantanediol (product 1) via substitution, where each bromine atom is replaced by an hydroxyl group. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. However, this is inconsistent with a simple diol. A more plausible interpretation is that the product is a ketone or an acetal, but the exact structure remains unclear.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a strong Lewis acid. This step likely promotes dehydration of the diol, forming an alkene (product 2). The exact structure of the alkene depends on the positions of the hydroxyl groups in product 1, but it is reasonable to assume that the double bond forms between carbons adjacent to the hydroxyl groups.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. The resulting product 3 likely contains carbonyl groups, with the most deshielded hydrogens being those adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogens in product 3 are adjacent to carbonyl groups. These hydrogens are coupled with neighboring hydrogens. If each hydrogen is coupled with two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group, the splitting pattern would be a triplet. This is consistent with the typical splitting observed for such environments in NMR.

Given the reasoning above, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and dibromide would have bromine atoms at 1 and 3 positions. Heating with KOH sounds like an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, since it's dibromide, perhaps two eliminations happen.

Wait, but when you have vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo), treatment with a strong base like KOH usually leads to elimination, forming an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on 1 and 3, which are across each other on the adamantane structure. Hmm. So maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, but KOH could deprotonate a beta hydrogen and eliminate HBr twice. But in adamantane, the structure is quite rigid. So perhaps each elimination forms a double bond. Wait, the product is a light yellow solid, which sounds like a conjugated diene maybe, or perhaps just a single alkene.

Looking at the NMR data: the product has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where an ether or an alcohol's proton might be. Or maybe it's an epoxide, but that's usually around 4.5-4.7 with two protons. Wait, but 4.79 is a bit upfield for an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, like an oxygen connected to two CH2 groups.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a diol. Because when a dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, especially under certain conditions, it can form a diol via an SN2 mechanism. But wait, for vicinal dihalides, that's more common. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane—maybe it's a diastereomer that allows for such a reaction. But adamantane is a very rigid structure, so the bromines are probably in axial positions.

Wait, wait, when dihalides (like 1,2-dibromoethane) are treated with KOH, maybe they form a 1,2-ethene via elimination. But in this case, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on adjacent carbons in a ring structure. So perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But wait, the product is a diol, perhaps. Because sometimes, when the base is in excess and conditions are such, the dihalide can undergo a substitution twice, leading to a diol.

Wait, but the product is formed when heated with KOH. So maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene. But the NMR doesn't show any peaks that suggest an alkene. Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe the product isn't a diol but something with a carbonyl group.

Wait, if it's a carbonyl, then maybe it's an epoxide ring opening or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but let me think again. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Let me imagine the structure. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on two non-adjacent carbons. Maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene? But if that's the case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, so maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a substitution. For each Br, it could replace with an OH group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-diol. But in that case, the NMR would show peaks for the OH groups, but the product is a solid, which might indicate it's not a diol because diols are usually more polar and would have broad OH peaks in NMR. But wait, the NMR given doesn't have any broad peaks; it's all sharp signals. So maybe the OH groups deprotonate, but in the NMR, they might not be present. Or perhaps they are in a different environment.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong. That's about where esters, ketones, or maybe an aldehyde's carbonyl appears. Esters are around 1740-1710, ketones at 1700-1750. So maybe the product is a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But then the IR would show a C-O-C peak around 1250 cm-1, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, another possibility: if the reaction is an elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not carbonyl groups. Unless it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, but that's not a typical reaction for vicinal dihalides. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a case of the formation of a diketone. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps each bromine is replaced by an oxygen-containing group. Wait, but KOH is a base, so perhaps it's forming a crown ether or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR data. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Let me think of the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would make a diol. But the IR doesn't show an OH stretch; instead, it's a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to each bromine, leading to the formation of an alkoxide, which then eliminates HBr, forming a double bond. But wait, that would produce an alkene, not a carbonyl. Unless it's a conjugated diene, but again, the IR doesn't show that.

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a bicyclic ketone. Wait, but that would require some kind of ring contraction or expansion, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, forming a diene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. 4.79 ppm for 2H. Maybe it's an OCH2 group. Like an ether or an epoxide. Wait, but in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm. 4.79 is a bit upfield for an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with some neighboring protons. But wait, the 4.79 ppm is for 2H, perhaps two protons adjacent to an oxygen. Let me think: in a diol, maybe the two OH groups would be on adjacent carbons, but then the other protons would be in different regions.

Wait, maybe it's an ether. Like, two CH2-O groups. But then why is there a carbonyl in the IR?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether, but with a carbonyl group elsewhere. That's confusing.

Wait, another approach: what's the product when a dihalide reacts with KOH? Oh! Wait, maybe it's the formation of a diol via substitution. Each Br is replaced by an OH group. But that would make 1,3-diol. Then, what's the NMR of that?

In that case, the diol would have two OH groups. But in the NMR provided, there's no broad peak around 1-5 ppm, which would be expected for OH protons. So maybe the diol is deprotonated, but under the reaction conditions, perhaps it's not. Alternatively, maybe the diol is further reacting.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So maybe the diol undergoes some kind of oxidation, but the reaction conditions are KOH and heat. Hmm, not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the diol is forming an acetal or something else, but I don't see how that would fit.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the initial product. Let's think again: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH. Perhaps each Br leaves as Br- and forms a carbocation, but that's unlikely in a rigid adamantane structure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to elimination, forming a double bond. But with two Br atoms, perhaps two eliminations occur, leading to two double bonds or one conjugated diene.

Wait, but the product's IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How?

Wait, maybe each elimination forms a ketone. But that doesn't make sense because elimination usually leads to alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a different mechanism.

Wait, another idea: the base could cause a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, if you have a vicinal dihalide, and you eliminate two HX molecules, you can form a double bond. But in this case, perhaps the structure allows for the formation of a ketone if the elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a bromide oxide, which could then eliminate to form a carbonyl. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide, but I don't think that would give a carbonyl IR peak. Epoxides have C-O-C, which absorbs around 1250 cm⁻¹, but the IR here is 1720, which is more for a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how would that form from a dihalide? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether with an adjacent carbonyl group. Like, for example, if two OH groups form, but then perhaps some kind of hemiacetal or acetal formation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen atom, leading to an epoxide. But then the structure would have an epoxide ring, but I'm not sure that fits the NMR.

Wait, maybe the initial product is 1,3-adamantanediol. So, after substitution, each Br is replaced by OH. Then, the product is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid and can catalyze various reactions, like Friedel-Crafts, but in the presence of an alcohol, perhaps it forms an acetal or something else.

Wait, but after that, the product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis is used to cleave alkenes. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups.

So, putting this all together: product 1 is perhaps a diol, which then reacts with Al(i-Pr)3 to form an ether or some other structure with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

Wait, but let me go step by step.

Product 1: initial reaction with KOH. The IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone or ester. The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm, 2H. Maybe this is an OCH2 group. Wait, another possibility is that product 1 is a diol with an adjacent carbonyl group. Or perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is not substitution but elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules to form 1,3-diene, but that's unlikely due to the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it forms a conjugated diene.

Wait, but then the IR would show C=C peaks around 1650 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an ether oxygen. Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the reaction forms a ketone. Let's say each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that's not how substitution works. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates a hydrogen, and the bromide leaves, leading to formation of an oxide, which then loses another proton to form a carbonyl. Hmm, that could be possible.

Wait, for example, if each Br is on a secondary carbon, and when the base abstracts a proton, the Br leaves as Br⁻, forming a carbocation. But in adamantane, the carbocation would be very stable. Then, another deprotonation and elimination could form a double bond, but then again, why the carbonyl?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Al(i-Pr)3 is a strong Lewis acid and is used in various reactions, such as the formation of acetonides (acetals) from ketones and diols. So if product 1 has a ketone, then heating with Al(i-Pr)3 might form an acetal. Because acetals are formed by the reaction of ketones or aldehydes with diols or other alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts.

Wait, but product 1's IR has a carbonyl peak, so maybe it's a ketone. If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 would be an acetal formed by reacting the ketone with a diol in the presence of Al(i-Pr)3 as a catalyst. So the product 2 would be an acetal, which would have an ether linkage.

But then, when product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis, ozone would react with any double bonds. So for ozonolysis to occur, product 2 must have a double bond. Wait, but acetals are ethers; they don't have double bonds. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not a ketone but an epoxide. Then, product 2, after reaction with Al(i-Pr)3, perhaps opens the epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(i-Pr)3, it forms an acetal from a ketone. But then where's the ketone coming from? Maybe product 1 is a diol adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acetal. But then product 2 wouldn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an acetal (which is an ether), then product 3 after ozonolysis wouldn't have any double bonds. But the question says that ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2, which suggests that product 2 has a double bond.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's try a different approach.

Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of an alkene typically cleaves it into carbonyl compounds. So product 3 would be the result of breaking a double bond into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So, thinking back, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with Al(i-Pr)3. If product 1 is a diol, perhaps the Al(i-Pr)3 helps it eliminate water, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Wait, that makes more sense. So product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an alkene formed by elimination (dehydration) of the diol. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So let's piece it together:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (diol, 1,3-adamantanediol)
2. product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 → product 2 (an alkene formed by elimination of water)
3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

So, product 3's NMR would show the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. We are to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

So, the most deshielded hydrogen would likely be near the carbonyl group because deshielding occurs in such environments.

In ozonolysis, the alkene is cleaved, and each carbonyl group is formed on each fragment. The protons adjacent to the carbonyl (α-protons) would couple with neighboring hydrogens.

But in this case, the structure of product 3 depends on the structure of product 2, which is an alkene. So let's think about product 2.

Product 2 is formed by treating product 1 (diol) with Al(i-Pr)3. The diol is 1,3-adamantanediol. Heating with a Lewis acid like Al(i-Pr)3 would promote dehydration, forming an alkene. So the diol would lose water to form an alkene.

But in adamantane, the structure is rigid. So the diol has hydroxyl groups on carbons 1 and 3. Elimination would require the loss of a water molecule from adjacent carbons. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent; they're separated by one carbon (since it’s 1,3-diol). So elimination would require the loss of a water from each adjacent to each OH group.

Wait, no. Wait, in 1,3-adamantanediol, the two OH groups are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. So when heated with Al(i-Pr)3, which is a strong Lewis acid, it could abstract a proton β to each OH, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Or maybe another pair of carbons.

Wait, but in the adamantane structure, each carbon is connected to three others in a diamond-like lattice. So when the diol loses two water molecules, it forms a double bond. Let me imagine the structure: if the diol is on carbons 1 and 3, elimination could form a double bond between 1 and 2 or between 3 and 4, but I'm not sure about the exact positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a conjugated diene, but more likely, it's a single double bond. So product 2 would be 1,2-adamantadiene or something similar.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a diene would produce multiple carbonyl groups. But perhaps in this case, the diene is in a position that when ozonolyzed, it breaks into smaller fragments.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is in a position that upon ozonolysis, each end becomes a carbonyl group, and the structure of product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent protons.

So, after ozonolysis, each of the carbonyl groups would have adjacent hydrogens. The most deshielded hydrogens would be the ones adjacent to the carbonyl.

In the NMR, these protons would typically be deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group. Their coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring hydrogens.

If each carbonyl group is adjacent to a CH2 group, then each CH2 would be split into a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, let's think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a mono-alkene. Ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. But if the alkene is symmetric, the products would be the same on both sides.

Assuming the double bond is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would yield two carbonyls each attached to a CH2 group. So each CH2 would have two protons. These protons would each be adjacent to a carbonyl group.

In such a case, each CH2 group's protons would be split based on their neighboring groups. Let's say each CH2 is next to another CH2 group. Then, each proton would be split by coupling with two neighboring protons on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but if each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, the coupling would be between protons on adjacent CH2 groups. Each proton on a CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2. So each proton would have a triplet of triplets? Or perhaps a triplet.

Alternatively, considering the typical splitting when two neighboring groups are present: each CH2 group is split by the adjacent CH2. Each H on a CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent group (like a vicinal coupling), leading to a triplet. But wait, each H is also coupled with another H on the same CH2, but that's geminal and doesn't split the peak in 1H NMR.

So, each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would cause each H to be a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet for each H.

Wait, but wait, in this scenario, each CH2 has two Hs, and each H is coupling with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. But in reality, each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group. So for each proton, the coupling would be with two Hs (from each adjacent CH2), which would lead to a more complex splitting.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the structure is something like CH2-CO and another CH2-CO, connected by the ozonolysis cleavage. No, wait, ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is two carbonyl groups connected to CH2 groups, which are in turn connected to the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, maybe the ozonolysis produces two smaller molecules, each with a carbonyl group. But given that the starting material was an adamantane derivative, the product might have multiple rings but with cleaved double bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis of a single double bond in a symmetric structure would produce two identical carbonyl compounds.

But let's get back to the NMR part. The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So, the H closest to the carbonyl group would be the most deshielded. The splitting would be due to coupling with neighboring Hs.

If the structure is such that each H is adjacent to a CH2 group, then each H would have coupling with two Hs on each neighboring group. Wait, for example, if it's a structure like (CH2)CO, but that's not exactly right.

Wait, perhaps each carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, and those CH2 groups are next to each other. So, the structure might be CH2-CO-CH2-CO. But when ozone is used, it breaks the double bond, so perhaps the structure is more like two CO groups connected by CH2 groups.

Alternatively, maybe each carbonyl is part of a ring, which would restrict the movement of the protons. But I'm not entirely sure.

But focusing on the coupling pattern: if each H is adjacent to two other Hs (on the same CH2), but also next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have n+1 peaks, where n is the number of neighboring Hs. So if each H is next to two Hs, the splitting would be a triplet. But wait, each H is also coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the total coupling would be for each H to have two neighboring Hs, leading to (2+1)=3, a triplet. But wait, if each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group, that would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Oh wait, no, because the Hs on the same CH2 are geminal and don't split each other. So each H only couples with the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

If each H is coupled with two Hs (from the adjacent CH2), then each H would be a triplet.

But wait, let me think of a simple example. Imagine a structure like CH2-CH2, connected to carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet. So the splitting would be a triplet.

But in reality, the splitting might be more complex if there are more adjacent Hs. Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and two Hs from another, leading to more splitting.

Wait, another possibility: if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, but that's not possible because each H is on a CH2, which is connected to the carbonyl. So each H would only have coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But another factor: the Hs on the same CH2 are equivalent, so the splitting might be a triplet for each H.

Wait, but what if the adjacent group is a CH2 with two Hs, and each H is coupled with both of them? The coupling would be (n+1), where n=2, so triplet.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one side and another two from the other, but that might not be the case here.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is between the Hs on both sides. Let's say each H is next to two Hs on one side and another two on the other. But in reality, each H would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs, so the pattern is a triplet.

But looking at the answer options, option A is triplet, B is triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, another thought: perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent group and another two on another adjacent group, leading to a more complex splitting. For example, if each H is coupled with two Hs on the left and two on the right, that would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no, because each H can only couple with the Hs on adjacent carbons. Let's imagine a structure where each CH2 is connected to another CH2 on both sides. For example, a chain like CH2-CH2-CO.

Wait, no, because ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, so the product would have carbonyl groups at each end.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think of the splitting as a triplet because each H is coupled with two Hs on the adjacent group.

Wait, but wait: if each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent group, but that's not possible because each H is on a CH2 which is only adjacent to one other CH2. So each H would couple with two Hs from the adjacent group. So the splitting would be a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two on the other, but that would require each CH2 being adjacent to two other CH2 groups, which is not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 on each side. For example, in a cyclic structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product after ozonolysis is a diketone, where each ketone has adjacent CH2 groups. So the structure would be something like (CH2)2CO. But no, that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, and these CH2 groups are adjacent to each other. So the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-CO, but connected to the adamantane structure. But ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups, each connected to CH2 groups.

In such a case, each H on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. Wait, but the same CH2 Hs are geminal, so they don't split each other. So each H would be coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, another possibility: each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two Hs on the other. But that would require each CH2 being adjacent to two other CH2 groups, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, and each H is coupled with two Hs on that adjacent group, leading to a triplet.

Hmm, I think I'm going around in circles. Let's try to think of a simpler structure. Suppose product 2 is 1,2-diene, and ozonolysis cleaves it into two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

After ozonolysis, each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would be coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

But wait, the NMR would show a triplet for those Hs. So looking at the options, option A is triplet.

But wait, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom. So perhaps in product 3, the most deshielded Hs are on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl group. Each of these Hs would be coupled with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the answer would be A) triplet.

But wait, another possibility: if the Hs are adjacent to more than one set of Hs, the coupling could be more complex. For example, if each H is coupled with two Hs on one side and another two on the other, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are coupled with two Hs from each adjacent group, leading to a triplet of triplets. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to geminal diols, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident, but based on the reasoning that each H is coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group, the splitting would be a triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in the formation of 1,3-adamantanediol (product 1) via substitution, where each bromine atom is replaced by an hydroxyl group. The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. However, this is inconsistent with a simple diol. A more plausible interpretation is that the product is a ketone or an acetal, but the exact structure remains unclear.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(i-Pr)₃), a strong Lewis acid. This step likely promotes dehydration of the diol, forming an alkene (product 2). The exact structure of the alkene depends on the positions of the hydroxyl groups in product 1, but it is reasonable to assume that the double bond forms between carbons adjacent to the hydroxyl groups.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts alkenes into carbonyl compounds. The resulting product 3 likely contains carbonyl groups, with the most deshielded hydrogens being those adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogens in product 3 are adjacent to carbonyl groups. These hydrogens are coupled with neighboring hydrogens. If each hydrogen is coupled with two hydrogens on an adjacent CH₂ group, the splitting pattern would be a triplet. This is consistent with the typical splitting observed for such environments in NMR.

Given the reasoning above, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
