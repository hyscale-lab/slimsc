Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem states that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s, right?

Wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the relative velocity is 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at the same speed, but in the opposite direction. Since both are inertial frames, we can consider this as a simple velocity addition problem, but wait, maybe it's just about time dilation or length contraction?

Wait, no, because the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, so time is different in different frames.

So I need to find how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Then, using the velocity in the Galaxy's frame, multiply by that time to get the distance.

Wait, but according to special relativity, time dilation occurs when there's relative motion. The gamma factor comes into play. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). But wait, the speeds here are 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that in meters per second to see how it compares to the speed of light.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 meters per second. The speed of light is about 300,000,000 m/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light—that's 20% the speed of light. Hmm, so relativistic effects might be significant, but not super extreme.

But wait, let me compute the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute v²: (60000 km/s) is 6e4 km/s, v = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 m/s? Wait, no, no. Wait, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km is 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 meters. So 60,000 km/s is 6e7 m/s. But the speed of light is 3e8 m/s. So (v/c) is 0.2, as I thought earlier.

So v = 0.2c. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.04)) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98 (since 0.98^2 is 0.9604). So gamma is approximately 1/0.98 ≈ 1.0204. 

Wait, but since v is 0.2c, maybe it's better to compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.96 is 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) is sqrt(24)/5. Hmm, sqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98 as I thought. So gamma is around 1.0204.

So the time experienced in the Galaxy frame (t) and the ejecta frame (t') are related by t = gamma * t', since the events are moving relative to each other. Wait, but wait, which frame is which? 

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. So when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds have passed, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? 

Wait, no. Let me think: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. So in the ejecta's frame, the time between events (say, the start and end of the 50-second interval) is t' =50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, this time is longer. So t = gamma * t' because the Galaxy is moving relative to the ejecta.

Wait, no. Time dilation depends on the frame's perspective. If the Galaxy is moving relative to the ejecta, then from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's clocks are running slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's frame would have less time passed? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, time dilation means that a moving clock runs slower. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's clock is moving, so the Galaxy's clock runs slower. So when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds, the Galaxy's clock would have passed less time. But wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, what is the time that has passed when the ejecta's frame says 50 seconds have passed?

Wait, perhaps I should model it using the Lorentz transformation. Because in the ejecta frame, the time is t', and the Galaxy's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the ejecta frame (since the ejecta sees the Galaxy moving at v towards it). So the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's time is t' is given by t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c² ). But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the velocity of the ejecta as observed in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no. The problem is that the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta has a velocity v. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes is t, and the ejecta travels a distance d = v * t.

But in the ejecta's frame, the elapsed time is t'. So we need to find t in terms of t', given that t' = 50 seconds.

So how are t and t' related? From the perspective of the Galaxy, the ejecta is moving at v. So the time experienced in the Galaxy would be longer than in the ejecta's frame because the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy.

Wait, but according to time dilation, moving clocks run slower. So from the Galaxy's point of view, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy sees less time passing? That doesn't make sense because the ejecta is moving. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. Let's set up the two frames:

- Frame S: the Galaxy's rest frame. The ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v.

- Frame S': the ejecta's rest frame. The Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v.

We can use the Lorentz transformation to find the time in S when the time in S' is t' =50 s.

The Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² ).

But in this scenario, the events are the start and end of the 50-second interval in S'.

Assuming that in S', the two events (start and end) happen at the same place, x' =0. Because the ejecta is at rest, so the position doesn't change.

So x' =0 for both events. So the expression simplifies to t = gamma * t'.

Wait, no. Because if in S', the events are at x'=0, then t = gamma t' + (gamma v x')/(c² ), but x'=0. So t = gamma t'.

Wait, but that can't be correct. Because that would mean that the time in S is longer than t', which is the case when the events are at the same place in S'. So in this case, when the events are happening at the same point in S' (the ejecta's frame), the time in S is longer by gamma.

So in this scenario, when t' =50 seconds, t = gamma * 50 s.

But wait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is longer than 50 seconds. So the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame is v =60,000 km/s, so the distance it travels is v * t.

So the steps are:

1. Compute gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), where v =60,000 km/s =6e4 *1e3 m/s =6e7 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c =0.2.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062.

2. Compute t = gamma * t' = 1.02062 * 50 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

3. Distance d in Galaxy's frame is v * t =60,000 km/s * 51.031 s.

Compute 60,000 *51.031 = 60,000 *51 + 60,000 *0.031.

60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 *0.031 = 1,860.

Total d= 3,060,000 + 1,860 = 3,061,860 km.

Wait, but wait, the options are in millions. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A) 2,940,000

B) 3,000,000

C) 2,880,000

D) 3,060,000

Hmm, my approximation gave 3,061,860, but option D is 3,060,000. So perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.

0.96 is equal to 24/25, so sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. Sqrt(24) is approximately 4.898979486. So sqrt(0.96) is 4.898979486 /5 = approximately 0.979795897.

So gamma is 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.0206185.

So t = 50 * 1.0206185 ≈ 51.030925 seconds.

So distance d = 60,000 km/s *51.030925 s = 60,000 *51.030925.

Compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 *0.030925= 60,000 *0.03=1,800; 60,000 *0.000925=55.5. So total is 1,800 +55.5=1,855.5 km.

So d=3,060,000 + 1,855.5 = 3,061,855.5 km.

Looking at the options, the closest one is D) 3,060,000 km. But wait, my calculation got 3,061,855, which is about 3.06 million km, but option D is 3,060,000. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the length contraction. Because from the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy is contracted.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects and just wants a classical approach. Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a significant fraction, but maybe the question expects a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, but the problem says to consider the frames as inertial, but doesn't mention anything about ignoring relativity. So I'm a bit confused. Because if we ignore relativity, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, so distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's the non-relativistic approach.

But the problem says both are inertial frames, so it's likely expecting a relativity-based solution.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is whether to use proper time or not. Let's think again.

In the ejecta's frame, the time is t' =50 seconds. The distance the ejecta has moved in its own frame is zero. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance is v * t. But how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame says 50 seconds.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer because the events (start and end of the 50-second interval) are at the same place in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the two events (say, the front of the ejecta passing a point, and another event) happen at the same place, so the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation. So t = gamma * t'.

So with t' =50 s, t =1.0206185 *50=51.030925 s.

So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v*t =60,000 km/s *51.030925 s=3,061,855 km. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, so the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy is shorter. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v.

So the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy's center is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), where L0 is the proper length in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, wait. Proper length is the length in the rest frame, which would be the Galaxy's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ).

But how does this help? Because the question is about how far the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, maybe I should use the fact that in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, and the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. So the distance the Galaxy travels in the ejecta's frame is v * t' =60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km.

So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy has moved 3 million km towards the ejecta. But from the Galaxy's frame, what is the distance the ejecta has moved?

Wait, but this approach is confusing. Let me think in terms of velocity addition.

Wait, no, because the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, which is simply v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck between the options. If the correct answer is option D, 3,060,000 km, then perhaps the problem expects us to use the time dilation factor.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately.

v =6e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

v² =3.6e15 m²/s².

c²=9e16 m²/s².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 3.6e15/9e16 = 1 - 0.04 =0.96.

So gamma =1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.0206185.

So t = gamma * t' =50 *1.0206185=51.030925 s.

d=60,000 km/s *51.030925 s= (60,000 *51.030925)= 3,061,855.5 km.

But the options don't have this. The nearest is D)3,060,000.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the proper time is the 50 seconds, so the actual time in the Galaxy's frame is longer.

Wait, but the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So t' is 50. So t = gamma * t'. So t=51.030925 s.

But wait, perhaps in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is v=60,000 km/s, so the distance is 60,000 km/s *51.030925 s=3,061,855.5 km.

But none of the options match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but both frames are inertial, so why would that be necessary?

Wait, alternative approach: using the proper time. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. But in this case, the events are the ejecta moving and the time passing. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. But t is related to t' (ejecta's frame time) by the time dilation factor.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the options. Option B is 3,000,000 km, which is 60,000 km/s *50 s. That's the non-relativistic approach, where t is 50 s.

But according to relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance would be longer than 3 million km. But the options don't have that. The closest higher option is D)3,060,000.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the Lorentz contraction formula for the distance.

Wait, another way: in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v. So the time for the galaxy to cover the distance (from the ejecta's perspective) would be shorter. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the speed is 60,000 km/s, and time is 50 seconds. So the distance is 60,000 *50 =3e6 km. Which is option B.

But why would that be? Because the problem says that both are inertial frames, so perhaps the correct approach is just to use the product of speed and time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame correspond to a shorter distance in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the options again.

Option B is 3,000,000 km, which is 60,000 *50. So that's the non-relativistic approach.

Option D is 3,060,000, which is approximately 60,000 *51. So that's 51 seconds. Which aligns with gamma*t' when gamma is about 1.02.

So I think the correct answer is D)3,060,000 km. But wait, the calculation I did earlier gives 3,061,855 km, which is approximately 3,060,000 km, so D is the correct option.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta moves towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of **60,000 km/s** (or **0.2c**, where **c** is the speed of light). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference over a time of **50 seconds** in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relating Time in Different Frames**:  
   Since the frames are inertial, we use special relativity to relate the time intervals. The time dilation factor **γ (gamma)** is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.2c\):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  

   The time in the Galaxy's frame (\(t\)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\(t'\)) by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   Substituting \(t' = 50 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at a constant speed of \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\). The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(t = 51.03 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]  

3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  
   The calculated distance (\(3,061,800 \, \text{km}\)) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding during intermediate steps.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem states that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s, right?

Wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the relative velocity is 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving at the same speed, but in the opposite direction. Since both are inertial frames, we can consider this as a simple velocity addition problem, but wait, maybe it's just about time dilation or length contraction?

Wait, no, because the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, so time is different in different frames.

So I need to find how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame. Then, using the velocity in the Galaxy's frame, multiply by that time to get the distance.

Wait, but according to special relativity, time dilation occurs when there's relative motion. The gamma factor comes into play. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). But wait, the speeds here are 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that in meters per second to see how it compares to the speed of light.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 meters per second. The speed of light is about 300,000,000 m/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 times the speed of light—that's 20% the speed of light. Hmm, so relativistic effects might be significant, but not super extreme.

But wait, let me compute the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute v²: (60000 km/s) is 6e4 km/s, v = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, no, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 m/s? Wait, no, no. Wait, 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 60,000 km is 6e4 * 1e3 = 6e7 meters. So 60,000 km/s is 6e7 m/s. But the speed of light is 3e8 m/s. So (v/c) is 0.2, as I thought earlier.

So v = 0.2c. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.04)) = 1/sqrt(0.96). Let's compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.98 (since 0.98^2 is 0.9604). So gamma is approximately 1/0.98 ≈ 1.0204. 

Wait, but since v is 0.2c, maybe it's better to compute it more accurately. Let me think: 0.96 is 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) is sqrt(24)/5. Hmm, sqrt(24) is approximately 4.89898. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98 as I thought. So gamma is around 1.0204.

So the time experienced in the Galaxy frame (t) and the ejecta frame (t') are related by t = gamma * t', since the events are moving relative to each other. Wait, but wait, which frame is which? 

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. So when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds have passed, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? 

Wait, no. Let me think: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. So in the ejecta's frame, the time between events (say, the start and end of the 50-second interval) is t' =50 seconds. But in the Galaxy's frame, this time is longer. So t = gamma * t' because the Galaxy is moving relative to the ejecta.

Wait, no. Time dilation depends on the frame's perspective. If the Galaxy is moving relative to the ejecta, then from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's clocks are running slower. So if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's frame would have less time passed? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, time dilation means that a moving clock runs slower. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's clock is moving, so the Galaxy's clock runs slower. So when the ejecta's clock says 50 seconds, the Galaxy's clock would have passed less time. But wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, what is the time that has passed when the ejecta's frame says 50 seconds have passed?

Wait, perhaps I should model it using the Lorentz transformation. Because in the ejecta frame, the time is t', and the Galaxy's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the ejecta frame (since the ejecta sees the Galaxy moving at v towards it). So the time in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's time is t' is given by t = gamma (t' + (v x') / c² ). But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the velocity of the ejecta as observed in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no. The problem is that the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta has a velocity v. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time that passes is t, and the ejecta travels a distance d = v * t.

But in the ejecta's frame, the elapsed time is t'. So we need to find t in terms of t', given that t' = 50 seconds.

So how are t and t' related? From the perspective of the Galaxy, the ejecta is moving at v. So the time experienced in the Galaxy would be longer than in the ejecta's frame because the ejecta's frame is moving relative to the Galaxy.

Wait, but according to time dilation, moving clocks run slower. So from the Galaxy's point of view, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy sees less time passing? That doesn't make sense because the ejecta is moving. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. Let's set up the two frames:

- Frame S: the Galaxy's rest frame. The ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v.

- Frame S': the ejecta's rest frame. The Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v.

We can use the Lorentz transformation to find the time in S when the time in S' is t' =50 s.

The Lorentz transformation for time is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² ).

But in this scenario, the events are the start and end of the 50-second interval in S'.

Assuming that in S', the two events (start and end) happen at the same place, x' =0. Because the ejecta is at rest, so the position doesn't change.

So x' =0 for both events. So the expression simplifies to t = gamma * t'.

Wait, no. Because if in S', the events are at x'=0, then t = gamma t' + (gamma v x')/(c² ), but x'=0. So t = gamma t'.

Wait, but that can't be correct. Because that would mean that the time in S is longer than t', which is the case when the events are at the same place in S'. So in this case, when the events are happening at the same point in S' (the ejecta's frame), the time in S is longer by gamma.

So in this scenario, when t' =50 seconds, t = gamma * 50 s.

But wait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the time that has passed is longer than 50 seconds. So the ejecta's velocity in the Galaxy's frame is v =60,000 km/s, so the distance it travels is v * t.

So the steps are:

1. Compute gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), where v =60,000 km/s =6e4 *1e3 m/s =6e7 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c =0.2.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.02062.

2. Compute t = gamma * t' = 1.02062 * 50 ≈ 51.031 seconds.

3. Distance d in Galaxy's frame is v * t =60,000 km/s * 51.031 s.

Compute 60,000 *51.031 = 60,000 *51 + 60,000 *0.031.

60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 *0.031 = 1,860.

Total d= 3,060,000 + 1,860 = 3,061,860 km.

Wait, but wait, the options are in millions. Let me check the options.

Options are:

A) 2,940,000

B) 3,000,000

C) 2,880,000

D) 3,060,000

Hmm, my approximation gave 3,061,860, but option D is 3,060,000. So perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.

0.96 is equal to 24/25, so sqrt(24/25) = sqrt(24)/5. Sqrt(24) is approximately 4.898979486. So sqrt(0.96) is 4.898979486 /5 = approximately 0.979795897.

So gamma is 1 / 0.979795897 ≈ 1.0206185.

So t = 50 * 1.0206185 ≈ 51.030925 seconds.

So distance d = 60,000 km/s *51.030925 s = 60,000 *51.030925.

Compute 60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 *0.030925= 60,000 *0.03=1,800; 60,000 *0.000925=55.5. So total is 1,800 +55.5=1,855.5 km.

So d=3,060,000 + 1,855.5 = 3,061,855.5 km.

Looking at the options, the closest one is D) 3,060,000 km. But wait, my calculation got 3,061,855, which is about 3.06 million km, but option D is 3,060,000. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the length contraction. Because from the ejecta's frame, the distance between the ejecta and the galaxy is contracted.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering relativistic effects and just wants a classical approach. Because 60,000 km/s is 0.2c, which is a significant fraction, but maybe the question expects a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, but the problem says to consider the frames as inertial, but doesn't mention anything about ignoring relativity. So I'm a bit confused. Because if we ignore relativity, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at 60,000 km/s for 50 seconds, so distance is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's the non-relativistic approach.

But the problem says both are inertial frames, so it's likely expecting a relativity-based solution.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is whether to use proper time or not. Let's think again.

In the ejecta's frame, the time is t' =50 seconds. The distance the ejecta has moved in its own frame is zero. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the distance is v * t. But how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when the ejecta's frame says 50 seconds.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The time in the Galaxy's frame is longer because the events (start and end of the 50-second interval) are at the same place in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the two events (say, the front of the ejecta passing a point, and another event) happen at the same place, so the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer due to time dilation. So t = gamma * t'.

So with t' =50 s, t =1.0206185 *50=51.030925 s.

So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v*t =60,000 km/s *51.030925 s=3,061,855 km. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it, so the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy is shorter. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v.

So the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy's center is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), where L0 is the proper length in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, wait. Proper length is the length in the rest frame, which would be the Galaxy's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ).

But how does this help? Because the question is about how far the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, maybe I should use the fact that in the ejecta's frame, the time is 50 seconds, and the Galaxy is moving towards it at v. So the distance the Galaxy travels in the ejecta's frame is v * t' =60,000 km/s *50 s =3,000,000 km.

So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy has moved 3 million km towards the ejecta. But from the Galaxy's frame, what is the distance the ejecta has moved?

Wait, but this approach is confusing. Let me think in terms of velocity addition.

Wait, no, because the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, which is simply v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck between the options. If the correct answer is option D, 3,060,000 km, then perhaps the problem expects us to use the time dilation factor.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately.

v =6e7 m/s, c=3e8 m/s.

v² =3.6e15 m²/s².

c²=9e16 m²/s².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 3.6e15/9e16 = 1 - 0.04 =0.96.

So gamma =1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.0206185.

So t = gamma * t' =50 *1.0206185=51.030925 s.

d=60,000 km/s *51.030925 s= (60,000 *51.030925)= 3,061,855.5 km.

But the options don't have this. The nearest is D)3,060,000.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the proper time is the 50 seconds, so the actual time in the Galaxy's frame is longer.

Wait, but the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So t' is 50. So t = gamma * t'. So t=51.030925 s.

But wait, perhaps in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's speed is v=60,000 km/s, so the distance is 60,000 km/s *51.030925 s=3,061,855.5 km.

But none of the options match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, but both frames are inertial, so why would that be necessary?

Wait, alternative approach: using the proper time. The proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. But in this case, the events are the ejecta moving and the time passing. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. But t is related to t' (ejecta's frame time) by the time dilation factor.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the options. Option B is 3,000,000 km, which is 60,000 km/s *50 s. That's the non-relativistic approach, where t is 50 s.

But according to relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the distance would be longer than 3 million km. But the options don't have that. The closest higher option is D)3,060,000.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the Lorentz contraction formula for the distance.

Wait, another way: in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is approaching at v. So the time for the galaxy to cover the distance (from the ejecta's perspective) would be shorter. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the speed is 60,000 km/s, and time is 50 seconds. So the distance is 60,000 *50 =3e6 km. Which is option B.

But why would that be? Because the problem says that both are inertial frames, so perhaps the correct approach is just to use the product of speed and time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame correspond to a shorter distance in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's think about the options again.

Option B is 3,000,000 km, which is 60,000 *50. So that's the non-relativistic approach.

Option D is 3,060,000, which is approximately 60,000 *51. So that's 51 seconds. Which aligns with gamma*t' when gamma is about 1.02.

So I think the correct answer is D)3,060,000 km. But wait, the calculation I did earlier gives 3,061,855 km, which is approximately 3,060,000 km, so D is the correct option.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta moves towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of **60,000 km/s** (or **0.2c**, where **c** is the speed of light). The question asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference over a time of **50 seconds** in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relating Time in Different Frames**:  
   Since the frames are inertial, we use special relativity to relate the time intervals. The time dilation factor **γ (gamma)** is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.2c\):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]  

   The time in the Galaxy's frame (\(t\)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\(t'\)) by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   Substituting \(t' = 50 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta moves at a constant speed of \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\). The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \(v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s}\) and \(t = 51.03 \, \text{s}\):  
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]  

3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  
   The calculated distance (\(3,061,800 \, \text{km}\)) is closest to option **D) 3,060,000 km**. The slight discrepancy is due to rounding during intermediate steps.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately **3,060,000 km**.
