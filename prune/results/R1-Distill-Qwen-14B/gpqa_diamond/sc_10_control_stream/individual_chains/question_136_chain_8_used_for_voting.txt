Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm, it's about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R.

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So f(r) is a vector pointing radially outward or inward, and its magnitude is 1/r². Wait, but the sign isn't specified. Oh well, probably doesn't matter for the divergence calculation, but I'll think about that.

The question is asking for the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of a sphere of radius R. So mathematically, it's ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV, where the integration is over the sphere of radius R.

I remember from the divergence theorem that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary surface. So in this case, it would be the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

So using the divergence theorem, the integral becomes the surface integral of f · n dA, where n is the outward normal vector. Since the sphere is centered at the origin, the normal vector at any point on the sphere is just the radial direction, which is the direction of f. So f · n is just the radial component of f multiplied by the magnitude of n, which is 1 (since n is a unit vector).

Wait, wait. Let's think about f(r). Since the field is only radial, and the normal vector is radial, their dot product is simply f(r) times the magnitude of the normal vector. But wait, f(r) is a vector, right? So actually, f is a vector function. Its radial component is given as 1/r². So f(r) is (1/r²) er, where er is the unit radial vector.

So f · n is (1/r² er) · er = 1/r². Because er · er is 1. So on the surface of the sphere, which is at radius R, r is R. So f · n = 1/R².

So the surface integral becomes ∫ (1/R²) dA over the surface of the sphere. Since 1/R² is constant, it can be pulled out of the integral. The integral of dA over the sphere's surface is the surface area. The surface area of a sphere is 4π R². So multiplying, we get (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

Wait, but that's the value according to the divergence theorem. But wait, what if we calculate the divergence directly and integrate it? Let's make sure.

The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) er. Let's compute the divergence ∇ · f in spherical coordinates. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component (A_r) is given by (1/(r² sinθ)) ∂(A_r sinθ)/(θ derivative) + (1/r) ∂A_r/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(A_θ)/∂φ. But since A_θ and A_φ are zero, only the first two terms contribute. Wait, no, actually, A_r is the only component, so the divergence is (1/r²) ∂(r² A_r)/∂r. Let me get that right.

The formula is ∇ · f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r) + terms from other components, which are zero here.

So substituting A_r = 1/r²:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr [1] = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because according to the divergence theorem, the integral is 4π, which is non-zero. So what's happening here?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. Oh, wait, because when r=0, the field is not defined. So the divergence is zero in the volume except at r=0. So integrating the divergence over the volume would give zero. But that contradicts what I found using the divergence theorem, which gave 4π.

Wait, no. Because the divergence theorem applies to the volume enclosed by the surface. So if the divergence is zero everywhere inside except at r=0, but the flux through the surface is 4π. So that suggests that the integral of the divergence is actually 4π, but the divergence itself is zero everywhere except at the origin where it's a delta function. So perhaps the vector field has a divergence that's a delta function at the origin.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. So for f(r) = (1/r²) er, the divergence in regions where r is not zero is zero. But the divergence at r=0 is not defined, but the field represents a point source or something similar.

Wait, the divergence of f(r) is zero everywhere except at the origin. So when I integrate the divergence over the entire volume (the sphere), I get zero. But according to the divergence theorem, the integral equals the flux through the surface, which is 4π. So this suggests a contradiction. Wait, no. Because the divergence of f is zero everywhere except at r=0. So when integrating, the integral is the same as the flux through the surface, which is 4π.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the divergence inside is zero except at origin, so the integral would be zero. But that's conflicting with the surface integral result.

Ah, perhaps the mistake is in computing the divergence. Let me re-calculate the divergence.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field F = F_r e_r + F_θ e_θ + F_φ e_φ is:

∇ · F = (1/r²) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(F_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ/∂φ.

Since F_θ and F_φ are zero, their terms vanish. So only the first term remains:

(1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

Given F_r = 1/r²,

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the field is not defined. So the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere is zero. But according to the divergence theorem, that integral equals the flux through the surface, which is 4π.

So that's a conflict. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, perhaps the field is not defined at the origin, which is inside the sphere. So when applying the divergence theorem, the theorem assumes that the vector field is differentiable everywhere inside the volume. But in our case, the field has a singularity at the origin. So the divergence theorem would still hold, but the divergence is a delta function at the origin.

Ah, right. So in reality, the divergence of f(r) is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So the integral of the divergence over the entire sphere (including any contributions from singular points) would be the flux through the surface, which is 4π.

But wait, the question says to evaluate the volume integral ∫ (div f) dV over the sphere. So if the divergence is zero except at a point (the origin), which has measure zero in the integral, then the integral would be zero. But that contradicts the surface integral result. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the divergence isn't actually zero. Let me think again about the vector field.

The field f(r) is (1/r²) er. Let's think about what this represents. In electromagnetism, for example, the electric field of a point charge is proportional to 1/r². The divergence of that field is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a delta function. So the divergence is ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), which would integrate to 4π over all space.

Wait, but in this problem, we're integrating only over the sphere of radius R. So if the field is f(r) = (1/r²) er, and the sphere includes the origin, then the volume integral would include the delta function at the origin, giving 4π. But if the sphere does not include the origin (e.g., if R=0, but that's not the case here), then the integral would be zero.

Wait, but in our problem, the sphere is centered at the origin and radius R. So the origin is inside the sphere, so the divergence has a delta function there. So the integral would include that delta function, making the integral equal to 4π.

But wait, the divergence as computed earlier is zero except at the origin. So the volume integral is:

∫ (div f) dV = ∫ [4π δ(r)] dV = 4π ∫ δ(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π.

But earlier, when I calculated using the surface integral, it gave 4π. So this suggests that the volume integral is 4π.

But wait, why did the direct divergence calculation give zero? Because the divergence is zero everywhere except at a point, which doesn't contribute to the integral in regions not including the origin. But in this case, the sphere does include the origin, so the integral is 4π.

Wait, but another way to think: the divergence is zero except at r=0. So the integral over a volume that includes r=0 would be 4π, and over a volume that doesn't (e.g., a sphere of radius less than zero, which isn't possible) would be zero. But in our case, R is positive, so the sphere includes the origin.

So the volume integral is 4π.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 4 π

B) 1

C) 4/3 π R 

D) 0

So the correct answer would be A) 4π.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated the divergence as zero, I thought the integral would be zero, but that's not correct because the divergence isn't zero—it's a delta function at the origin. So the integral picks up the contribution from the origin, giving 4π.

Alternatively, perhaps the original vector field is not 1/r² but something else. Wait, the magnitude is 1/r², and it's radial. So perhaps the field is f(r) = (1/r²) er. Then, in regions where r≠0, divergence is zero, but at r=0, it's a delta function.

So the volume integral is 4π.

So according to that, the correct answer is A) 4π.

The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** over a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The vector field has a magnitude \( f(r) = 1/r^2 \) and is purely radial in spherical coordinates.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Field and Divergence**:  
   The vector field is given as \( \mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \), where \( \mathbf{e}_r \) is the radial unit vector. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field with only a radial component \( F_r \) is:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F_r \right).
   \]
   Substituting \( F_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}(1) = 0.
   \]
   Thus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where the field is singular.

2. **Divergence Theorem**:  
   The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
   \]
   where \( \mathbf{n} \) is the outward unit normal vector on the surface. On the sphere of radius \( R \), \( \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{e}_r \), and \( \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} = \frac{1}{R^2} \). The surface integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
   \]
   This shows that the flux through the surface is \( 4\pi \).

3. **Interpreting the Divergence**:  
   The divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where it is proportional to a Dirac delta function \( \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \). The volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius \( R \) includes the contribution from the origin (since \( R > 0 \)), resulting in:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
   \]

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\( 4\pi \))**: Matches the result from the divergence theorem and accounts for the delta function contribution at the origin.  
   - **Option B (\( 1 \))**: Incorrect, as it does not match the divergence theorem result or the delta function contribution.  
   - **Option C (\( 4/3 \pi R \))**: Incorrect, as it does not correspond to the divergence or the flux calculation.  
   - **Option D (\( 0 \))**: Incorrect, as it ignores the contribution from the origin, where the divergence is a delta function.

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of the divergence of the vector field over the sphere is \( 4\pi \), consistent with the divergence theorem and the delta function contribution at the origin.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let's see what the question is asking. Hmm, it's about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R.

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates.

So using the divergence theorem, the integral becomes the surface integral of f · n dA, where n is the outward normal vector. Since the sphere is centered at the origin, the normal vector at any point on the sphere is just the radial direction, which is the direction of f. So f · n is just the radial component of f multiplied by the magnitude of n, which is 1 (since n is a unit vector).

Wait, wait. Let's think about f(r). Since the field is only radial, and the normal vector is radial, their dot product is simply f(r) times the magnitude of the normal vector. But wait, f(r) is a vector, right? So actually, f is a vector function. Its radial component is given as 1/r². So f(r) is (1/r²) er, where er is the unit radial vector.

So f · n is (1/r² er) · er = 1/r². Because er · er is 1. So on the surface of the sphere, which is at radius R, r is R. So f · n = 1/R².

So the surface integral becomes ∫ (1/R²) dA over the surface of the sphere. Since 1/R² is constant, it can be pulled out of the integral. The integral of dA over the sphere's surface is the surface area. The surface area of a sphere is 4π R². So multiplying, we get (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

Wait, but that's the value according to the divergence theorem. But wait, what if we calculate the divergence directly and integrate it? Let's make sure.

The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) er. Let's compute the divergence ∇ · f in spherical coordinates. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component (A_r) is given by (1/(r² sinθ)) ∂(A_r sinθ)/(θ derivative) + (1/r) ∂A_r/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(A_θ)/∂φ. But since A_θ and A_φ are zero, only the first two terms contribute. Wait, no, actually, A_r is the only component, so the divergence is (1/r²) ∂(r² A_r)/∂r. Let me get that right.

The formula is ∇ · f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r) + terms from other components, which are zero here.

So substituting A_r = 1/r²:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr [1] = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because according to the divergence theorem, the integral is 4π, which is non-zero. So what's happening here?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. Oh, wait, because when r=0, the field is not defined. So the divergence is zero in the volume except at r=0. So integrating the divergence over the volume would give zero. But that contradicts what I found using the divergence theorem, which gave 4π.

∇ · F = (1/r²) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(F_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ/∂φ.

Since F_θ and F_φ are zero, their terms vanish. So only the first term remains:

(1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

Given F_r = 1/r²,

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the field is not defined. So the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere is zero. But according to the divergence theorem, that integral equals the flux through the surface, which is 4π.

So that's a conflict. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

But if the sphere does not include the origin (e.g., if R=0, but that's not the case here), then the integral would be zero.

But wait, the divergence as computed earlier is zero except at the origin. So the volume integral is:

∫ (div f) dV = ∫ [4π δ(r)] dV = 4π ∫ δ(r) dV = 4π * 1 = 4π.

But earlier, when I calculated using the surface integral, it gave 4π. So this suggests that the volume integral is 4π.

So the volume integral is 4π.

But wait, the options given are:

The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** over a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The vector field has a magnitude \( f(r) = 1/r^2 \) and is purely radial in spherical coordinates.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Field and Divergence**:  
   The vector field is given as \( \mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \mathbf{e}_r \), where \( \mathbf{e}_r \) is the radial unit vector. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field with only a radial component \( F_r \) is:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F_r \right).
   \]
   Substituting \( F_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}(1) = 0.
   \]
   Thus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where the field is singular.

2. **Divergence Theorem**:  
   The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux of the vector field through the surface of the sphere:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
   \]
   where \( \mathbf{n} \) is the outward unit normal vector on the surface. On the sphere of radius \( R \), \( \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{e}_r \), and \( \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} = \frac{1}{R^2} \). The surface integral becomes:
   \[
   \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
   \]
   This shows that the flux through the surface is \( 4\pi \).

3. **Interpreting the Divergence**:  
   The divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where it is proportional to a Dirac delta function \( \delta^3(\mathbf{r}) \). The volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius \( R \) includes the contribution from the origin (since \( R > 0 \)), resulting in:
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
   \]

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\( 4\pi \))**: Matches the result from the divergence theorem and accounts for the delta function contribution at the origin.  
   - **Option B (\( 1 \))**: Incorrect, as it does not match the divergence theorem result or the delta function contribution.  
   - **Option C (\( 4/3 \pi R \))**: Incorrect, as it does not correspond to the divergence or the flux calculation.  
   - **Option D (\( 0 \))**: Incorrect, as it ignores the contribution from the origin, where the divergence is a delta function.

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of the divergence of the vector field over the sphere is \( 4\pi \), consistent with the divergence theorem and the delta function contribution at the origin.
