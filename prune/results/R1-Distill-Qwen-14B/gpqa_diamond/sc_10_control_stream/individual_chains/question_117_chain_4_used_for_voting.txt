Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So if a molecule has that, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question gives four compounds, and I need to determine which of them can exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the substituents here are nitro groups and methyl esters. But wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The connection is between the 1 positions of the two rings.

I'm thinking about whether this has a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, would that lead to any chirality? Oh wait, the substituents are on both rings, but the positions are symmetrical. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical overall. If there's a plane of symmetry, it might not have any chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for some kind of isomerism, but I'm not sure. Wait, in biphenyls, the rotation around the single bond can lead to different configurations. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then it could have stereoisomerism. But I'm not entirely sure if this leads to optical isomerism. Maybe yes if the molecule has a lack of symmetry leading to a chiral center or a chiral axis. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, which would mean no optical isomerism. Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. I'll have to think more. Maybe there's a possibility of this being a diastereomer situation, but I'm not certain.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, let me draw it. The propanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid and methanol. The structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but here it's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO-. No, wait, I think 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COO-. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)COOCH3 with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, wait, let's get the structure right. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO- as the acid, but when esterified with methyl, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but the structure actually is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the molecule is CH3- C(OH)(H)- COOCH3. Wait, that's correct. So the carbon with OH is CH2? No, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOCCH2OH, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it's an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, wait, another approach: propanoate is the propionate ion. So the ester is formed from propanoic acid and methanol. For 2-hydroxypropanoate, the OH is on the middle carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure would be: the ester group is OMe (from methyl), the carbonyl is attached to the middle carbon which has an OH group. So the structure is:

MeOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propionate. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Thus, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH2-OH connected to CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, because propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) has an OH and two CH2 groups. So wait, that central carbon has what attached? Let's see: on the carbon with OH, the groups are:

- OH
- CH3 (from the COOCH3)
- CH2CH3 (wait, no, because the chain is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (which is like a propionyl group)
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is as follows: the carbon chain is three carbons, with the ester group on the third carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let's think about the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. That would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when it's an ester, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second one) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, because CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 would have the structure as:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to CH2(OH) and CH2COOCH3. Wait no, that's not correct. Let me draw it as:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH) connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, that's not making sense. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (R)- or (S)-configured on the carbon with OH.

Wait, maybe the key is whether the carbon with the OH is a chiral center. For that, the carbon must have four different substituents. So in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure would be:

The central carbon (2nd) would have:

- OH group

- COOCH3 group

- two CH2 groups? Or perhaps one CH2 and another CH3?

Wait, the formula is perhaps CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Let me think: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Adding a hydroxyl on the second carbon would give CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, the central carbon is the second carbon. So its substituents are:

- OH

- CH2COOCH3

- two CH3 groups? No. Wait, maybe the structure is:

Carbon chain: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that would make the central carbon (CH(OH)) connected to:

- CH3 (left)

- COOCH3 (right)

- OH

- and the central carbon is also connected to another CH3? No, because in that structure, the central carbon is CH(OH), so it's attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the other CH2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH) part) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left)

- COOCH3 (from the right)

- OH

- and another hydrogen? Wait, no, because if it's CH(OH), that would be CH2 if it's connected to three things. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)

- COOCH3 (from the right)

- OH

- and another CH2 group? No, because in that case, the central carbon would be CH2, which can't have four substituents. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me count the bonds.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left)

- COOCH3 (right)

- OH

- and another H? So four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. If that's the case, then the central carbon is a chiral center because all four substituents are different. Therefore, this compound would have optical isomerism. So number 2 is positive.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone, so its structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are two phenyl groups and two oxygens (from the double bond). So that carbon has two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms, but since the double bond is there, the groups are not all different. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two double-bonded oxygens, but wait, in the structure, the carbonyl is O=C-Ph2. So the central carbon is C=O, with two phenyl groups attached. Therefore, it's not a chiral center because the substituents are Ph, Ph, O, and O. So no optical isomerism here, as there's no chiral center. So number 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a dihydroxy derivative of maleic acid, but I think fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is O

| \
O=C-OCH3
   |
CH2-CH2 (but wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me. So the structure is (MeO)CO-CH=CH-CO(O)Me. The double bond is between the two central carbons. So the groups on each end are COOCH3, and the double bond is between them.

So the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each end. So in this case, the groups on each side are COOCH3 and the other side is the same. Wait, but wait, if the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, because each end has the same groups. So the molecule would have a center of symmetry. So does that mean it's not chiral? Hmm, but wait, what about the possibility of geometric isomerism?

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical. Because fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so when you esterify both ends, the structure would be symmetrical across the double bond. So each side has COOCH3 and the same groups. So the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral. So it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry in the middle, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, another angle. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So if you have two methyl ester groups on each end, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So when you look at the molecule, it would mirror itself across the center, making it achiral. Therefore, it can't have optical isomerism. So number 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, some people might confuse geometric isomerism (cis/trans) with optical isomerism. But the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chirality, not geometric isomerism.

So now, let's recap each option:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me think again. The molecule is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond between their 1 positions). On each ring, there's a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2.

Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other on the ring (since 1 is where the bond is, so 2 and 6 are across from each other on the same ring). So each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the positions are 6 and 2 on the same ring. Wait, on a benzene ring with a single bond at position 1 (i.e., the biphenyl is 1,1'), each substituent is on the same benzene. So, position 6 on the first benzene is the same as position 2 on the same ring? Wait, no. Wait, benzene rings are numbered such that position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6, right? So substituents at 6 and 2 on the same ring would be across each other (para positions), as 1 is connected to the other ring.

So each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So on each benzene, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has two substituents, each at para positions.

Now, the biphenyl structure can rotate around the single bond. But if the substituents on each ring are in symmetric positions, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement of substituents on each ring is such that the entire molecule is not symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para. So the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, but on each ring. So when looking at the entire molecule, perhaps each substituent is aligned in such a way that the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. Alternatively, maybe it's asymmetrical.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about whether the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

So, each benzene ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 at para positions. The other substituent is on the opposite ring. But wait, the biphenyl structure has the benzene rings connected at 1 and 1' positions. So the substituents on each ring are arranged as follows: on ring A, positions 2 and 6 have substituents; on ring B, positions 2' and 6' have substituents.

But wait, since the rings are connected in a planar fashion, the substituents on each ring are in positions that might be arranged symmetrically. So perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is in such a way that the overall molecule is chiral. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetrical. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, for example, if the substituents are on opposite sides of the central bond, but arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral.

Given that I'm a bit confused on this point, perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two identical substituents on each ring, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, another angle: the substituents are nitro and COOCH3 on each ring. Nitro and COOCH3 are different groups, so perhaps their arrangement might lead to asymmetry.

Wait, but if on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para, the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical. So each ring has two substituents, para, one nitro and one COOCH3. But then, when considering the entire molecule, the arrangement could be such that the nitro on one ring is directly across from the COOCH3 on the other ring, leading to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and hence not chiral.

Given that I'm a bit stuck, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed to the other options and then make a decision.

So, from the four compounds:

1. Not sure, but perhaps no optical isomerism.

2. Yes, because the hydroxyl is on a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No, because it's symmetrical.

Wait, but in the options, let's see the options given:

Option A) 1, 2 and 4 → If 1 and 4 are yes, but I think 4 is no.

Option B)3 and 4 → 3 is no, 4 is no. So B would be no.

Option C) 2 and 3 → 2 is yes, 3 is no. So C is no.

Option D) 1 and 2 → 1 is maybe no, 2 is yes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me double-check.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH(COOCH3)CH2. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, so structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, wait, I think the correct structure is CH2CH2 with the double bond in between.

Wait, wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, so dimethyl ester would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, in reality, it's MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me. No, that's for succinate. Fumarate is the trans (E) isomer, so the structure would be MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group.

Because of this structure, the molecule is symmetrical. Because each end is the same: COOCH3 on both ends. So it has a plane of symmetry in the middle, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the compounds:

1. Not sure, but I think it's no.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, but I'm not so confident about compound 1.

Wait, another approach: a molecule can show optical isomerism if it has a chiral center, or if it has a chiral axis or plane, but that's less common. So, perhaps compound 1 has a chiral axis, making it show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure allows for the possibility of enantiomers. Biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is a form of chirality arising from the arrangement of substituents around the central bond. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group and a COOCH3 in para positions. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So the nitro and COOCH3 are opposite each other on each ring.

Now, the central bond (connecting 1 and 1') allows rotation. So, substituents on opposite rings can be arranged in a way that creates a non-symmetrical molecule.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that when looking from the top, the nitro and COOCH3 on each ring are in the same relative positions, then the molecule might be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So in that case, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not sure. So perhaps I should think about whether the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical.

Wait, nitro and COOCH3 are different groups. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, but the groups are different. So when you look at the entire molecule, the arrangement of the substituents might lead to a lack of symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe each substituent on one ring is opposite a substituent of the same type on the other ring. For example, on the first ring, substituents are nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. On the second ring, substituents are nitro at 6' and COOCH3 at 2'. So if the substituents are arranged such that nitro on ring A is opposite to nitro on ring B, then the molecule would be symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that the substituents are opposite each other, leading to a plane of symmetry. Thus, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that each nitro is next to a COOCH3 on the adjacent ring, then the molecule might be asymmetrical, leading to chirality.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the central bond, making it achiral. So each substituent on one ring is mirrored on the other ring, leading to symmetry.

If that's the case, then the molecule is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, in this scenario, compound 1 would not show optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, only number 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me review the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → No, because 4 is no.

B)3 and 4 → No, both are no.

C) 2 and 3 → 2 is yes, 3 is no.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no, 2 is yes.

But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. Wait, looking back at the options given:

Options:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B)3 and 4

C)2 and 3

D)1 and 2

So, none of the options include only 2. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. Oh wait, the question asks which of the four compounds show optical isomerism. So it's possible that more than one is correct, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, despite being symmetrical, it might have some sort of stereochemistry. Wait, but I thought it was symmetrical, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is the trans diastereomer, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't be chiral. So perhaps 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate is not symmetrical. Let me think again about the structure.

Fumarate is the trans (E) isomer of maleate. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure would be:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the substituents are on opposite sides, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So yes, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

So, back to the problem. Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center.

Wait, but in compound 1, the substituents are on the benzene rings. Benzene rings are flat, so the substituents would be in the plane. So, unless the arrangement leads to a chiral center elsewhere, perhaps not.

Wait, but the ester groups are at position 2 on each ring. So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para. So perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center in the central portion, but that's unlikely because the central bond is a single bond between two carbons in the rings.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Another approach: are any of the structures capable of having enantiomers?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that dimethyl fumarate is actually the same as dimethyl maleate but in the trans configuration, but whether that leads to chirality.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look for which of the compounds have a chiral center.

Compound 2: definitely a chiral center.

Compound 1: No chiral centers? Because the substituents are on benzene rings. Benzene rings can't have chiral centers because they're flat, and the attached groups are in a plane.

Wait, but perhaps the ester groups are attached in such a way that the molecule as a whole becomes chiral. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to proceed.

So, according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option with only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate has two COOCH3 groups attached to double bond. So, the structure is (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's the same as (COOCH3)2C-CH2, which isn't correct.

Wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, that's not right. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The dimethyl ester would replace the Hs with OCH3 groups. So, it's (CH2) groups with COOCH3 on each end of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not a double bond.

Wait, the correct structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H → esterification gives OMe groups. So, it's OMeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

But that's for succinic acid. For fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2=CH-CO-OCH3

Wait, that can't be right. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the double bond is between the two carbons that each have COOCH3 groups.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, but that would make the molecule symmetrical. So, each end has the same group, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so I think I'm confident that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have just 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1.

Wait, let me think again about compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other.

Now, on each ring, the substituents are a nitro and a COOCH3. So, each ring has two substituents in para positions. So, on ring A, substituents at 2 and 6 are COOCH3 and nitro. On ring B, substituents at 2' and 6' are COOCH3 and nitro.

Now, considering the entire molecule, the arrangement could have the nitro groups opposite each other, leading to a symmetrical molecule, or perhaps not.

Wait, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides of the central bond, and the ester groups are on the same side, then the molecule could be asymmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. If not, it's chiral. So, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it will be chiral.

But without a clear picture, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the substituents around a single bond are arranged in a non-symmetrical way, making the molecule chiral.

In biphenyls, axial chirality can arise when the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group in para positions. So, if the nitro and COOCH3 on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other create an asymmetrical arrangement around the central bond, the molecule would be chiral.

So, if on each ring, the nitro and COOCH3 are on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule could be asymmetrical. Alternatively, if they are on opposite sides, it could be symmetrical.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, assuming that the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if both compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, then the answer would be option D) 1 and 2.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident about compound 1. So, perhaps I should accept that I'm not sure and proceed with the options.

Wait, the question says, which of the following show optical isomerism. So, if both 1 and 2 exhibit it, then option D is correct.

But earlier, I thought that compound 1 is symmetrical, so it doesn't. But perhaps it is asymmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetric, leading to optical isomerism.

In that case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism, and so option D (1 and 2) would be correct.

So, putting it all together:

1: Yes (asymmetric)

2: Yes (chiral center)

4: No

3: No

So, the correct answer would be option D) 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought 1 was symmetrical, but perhaps it's not. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and 1 doesn't have a chiral center but has axial chirality.

In conclusion, based on the analysis, compounds 2 and 1 would exhibit optical isomerism, leading to option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality, which requires a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1,1' positions. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The substituents on each ring are in para positions (2 and 6). The molecule's symmetry depends on the arrangement of the substituents. If the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically relative to the central bond, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality. Thus, this compound can show optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon atom at the second position (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and an acetyloxy group. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the carbonyl carbon is doubly bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. Since the carbonyl carbon is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule is symmetrical and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure (COOCH3)2C=CH. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents (COOCH3) on both sides of the double bond, and it has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry or the absence of chirality.  

The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So if a molecule has that, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

The question gives four compounds, and I need to determine which of them can exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the substituents here are nitro groups and methyl esters. But wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The connection is between the 1 positions of the two rings.

I'm thinking about whether this has a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, would that lead to any chirality? Oh wait, the substituents are on both rings, but the positions are symmetrical. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical overall. If there's a plane of symmetry, it might not have any chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for some kind of isomerism, but I'm not sure. Wait, in biphenyls, the rotation around the single bond can lead to different configurations. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image, then it could have stereoisomerism. But I'm not entirely sure if this leads to optical isomerism. Maybe yes if the molecule has a lack of symmetry leading to a chiral center or a chiral axis. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, which would mean no optical isomerism. Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. I'll have to think more. Maybe there's a possibility of this being a diastereomer situation, but I'm not certain.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, let me draw it. The propanoate would be the ester of propanoic acid and methanol. The structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but here it's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO-. No, wait, I think 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COO-. Wait, maybe it's (CH2)COOCH3 with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. Wait, wait, let's get the structure right. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO- as the acid, but when esterified with methyl, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but the structure actually is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the molecule is CH3- C(OH)(H)- COOCH3. Wait, that's correct. So the carbon with OH is CH2? No, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOCCH2OH, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When it's an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, wait, another approach: propanoate is the propionate ion. So the ester is formed from propanoic acid and methanol. For 2-hydroxypropanoate, the OH is on the middle carbon of the three-carbon chain. So the structure would be: the ester group is OMe (from methyl), the carbonyl is attached to the middle carbon which has an OH group. So the structure is:

MeOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of the propionate. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Thus, the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH2-OH connected to CH2-COOCH3. Wait, no, because propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) has an OH and two CH2 groups. So wait, that central carbon has what attached? Let's see: on the carbon with OH, the groups are:

- OH
- CH3 (from the COOCH3)
- CH2CH3 (wait, no, because the chain is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (second carbon) is connected to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3 (which is like a propionyl group)
- and two CH2 groups? Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is as follows: the carbon chain is three carbons, with the ester group on the third carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let's think about the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. That would be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on the second carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So when it's an ester, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second one) is attached to:

- OH
- CH2COOCH3
- and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, because CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 would have the structure as:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, which is connected to CH2(OH) and CH2COOCH3. Wait no, that's not correct. Let me draw it as:

The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to COOCH3.

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C(OH) connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, that's not making sense. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (R)- or (S)-configured on the carbon with OH.

Wait, maybe the key is whether the carbon with the OH is a chiral center. For that, the carbon must have four different substituents. So in 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure would be:

The central carbon (2nd) would have:

- OH group

- COOCH3 group

- two CH2 groups? Or perhaps one CH2 and another CH3?

Wait, the formula is perhaps CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Let me think: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Adding a hydroxyl on the second carbon would give CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, the central carbon is the second carbon. So its substituents are:

- OH

- CH2COOCH3

- two CH3 groups? No. Wait, maybe the structure is:

Carbon chain: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Wait, that would make the central carbon (CH(OH)) connected to:

- CH3 (left)

- COOCH3 (right)

- OH

- and the central carbon is also connected to another CH3? No, because in that structure, the central carbon is CH(OH), so it's attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and the other CH2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH) part) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left)

- COOCH3 (from the right)

- OH

- and another hydrogen? Wait, no, because if it's CH(OH), that would be CH2 if it's connected to three things. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- CH3 (from the left)

- COOCH3 (from the right)

- OH

- and another CH2 group? No, because in that case, the central carbon would be CH2, which can't have four substituents. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me count the bonds.

If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (left)

- COOCH3 (right)

- OH

- and another H? So four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. If that's the case, then the central carbon is a chiral center because all four substituents are different. Therefore, this compound would have optical isomerism. So number 2 is positive.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone, so its structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. So the substituents on the carbonyl carbon are two phenyl groups and two oxygens (from the double bond). So that carbon has two phenyl groups and two oxygen atoms, but since the double bond is there, the groups are not all different. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two double-bonded oxygens, but wait, in the structure, the carbonyl is O=C-Ph2. So the central carbon is C=O, with two phenyl groups attached. Therefore, it's not a chiral center because the substituents are Ph, Ph, O, and O. So no optical isomerism here, as there's no chiral center. So number 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a dihydroxy derivative of maleic acid, but I think fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is O

| \
O=C-OCH3
   |
CH2-CH2 (but wait, no, the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid: HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me. So the structure is (MeO)CO-CH=CH-CO(O)Me. The double bond is between the two central carbons. So the groups on each end are COOCH3, and the double bond is between them.

So the molecule has a double bond with substituents on each end. So in this case, the groups on each side are COOCH3 and the other side is the same. Wait, but wait, if the substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, no, because each end has the same groups. So the molecule would have a center of symmetry. So does that mean it's not chiral? Hmm, but wait, what about the possibility of geometric isomerism?

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. So in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical. Because fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so when you esterify both ends, the structure would be symmetrical across the double bond. So each side has COOCH3 and the same groups. So the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral. So it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry in the middle, making it achiral. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, wait, another angle. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So if you have two methyl ester groups on each end, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So when you look at the molecule, it would mirror itself across the center, making it achiral. Therefore, it can't have optical isomerism. So number 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, some people might confuse geometric isomerism (cis/trans) with optical isomerism. But the question is about optical isomerism, which requires chirality, not geometric isomerism.

So now, let's recap each option:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

I'm a bit stuck on this. Let me think again. The molecule is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond between their 1 positions). On each ring, there's a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2.

Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6. So each ring's substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other on the ring (since 1 is where the bond is, so 2 and 6 are across from each other on the same ring). So each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the positions are 6 and 2 on the same ring. Wait, on a benzene ring with a single bond at position 1 (i.e., the biphenyl is 1,1'), each substituent is on the same benzene. So, position 6 on the first benzene is the same as position 2 on the same ring? Wait, no. Wait, benzene rings are numbered such that position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6, right? So substituents at 6 and 2 on the same ring would be across each other (para positions), as 1 is connected to the other ring.

So each benzene has a nitro at 6 and a COOCH3 at 2. So on each benzene, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has two substituents, each at para positions.

Now, the biphenyl structure can rotate around the single bond. But if the substituents on each ring are in symmetric positions, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement of substituents on each ring is such that the entire molecule is not symmetrical, then it could be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para. So the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, but on each ring. So when looking at the entire molecule, perhaps each substituent is aligned in such a way that the molecule as a whole is symmetrical. Alternatively, maybe it's asymmetrical.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about whether the molecule can have a plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. Alternatively, if the arrangement is such that there's no plane of symmetry, then it's chiral.

So, each benzene ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 at para positions. The other substituent is on the opposite ring. But wait, the biphenyl structure has the benzene rings connected at 1 and 1' positions. So the substituents on each ring are arranged as follows: on ring A, positions 2 and 6 have substituents; on ring B, positions 2' and 6' have substituents.

But wait, since the rings are connected in a planar fashion, the substituents on each ring are in positions that might be arranged symmetrically. So perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is in such a way that the overall molecule is chiral. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-symmetrical. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, for example, if the substituents are on opposite sides of the central bond, but arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral.

Given that I'm a bit confused on this point, perhaps I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two identical substituents on each ring, leading to a plane of symmetry.

Wait, another angle: the substituents are nitro and COOCH3 on each ring. Nitro and COOCH3 are different groups, so perhaps their arrangement might lead to asymmetry.

Wait, but if on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para, the arrangement on each ring is symmetrical. So each ring has two substituents, para, one nitro and one COOCH3. But then, when considering the entire molecule, the arrangement could be such that the nitro on one ring is directly across from the COOCH3 on the other ring, leading to symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and hence not chiral.

Given that I'm a bit stuck, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed to the other options and then make a decision.

So, from the four compounds:

1. Not sure, but perhaps no optical isomerism.

2. Yes, because the hydroxyl is on a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No, because it's symmetrical.

Wait, but in the options, let's see the options given:

Option A) 1, 2 and 4 → If 1 and 4 are yes, but I think 4 is no.

Option B)3 and 4 → 3 is no, 4 is no. So B would be no.

Option C) 2 and 3 → 2 is yes, 3 is no. So C is no.

Option D) 1 and 2 → 1 is maybe no, 2 is yes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me double-check.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate: the structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH(COOCH3)CH2. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, so structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, wait, I think the correct structure is CH2CH2 with the double bond in between.

Wait, wait, fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, so dimethyl ester would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, in reality, it's MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me. No, that's for succinate. Fumarate is the trans (E) isomer, so the structure would be MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So the double bond is between the two central carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group.

Because of this structure, the molecule is symmetrical. Because each end is the same: COOCH3 on both ends. So it has a plane of symmetry in the middle, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the compounds:

1. Not sure, but I think it's no.

2. Yes.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, but I'm not so confident about compound 1.

Wait, another approach: a molecule can show optical isomerism if it has a chiral center, or if it has a chiral axis or plane, but that's less common. So, perhaps compound 1 has a chiral axis, making it show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl structure allows for the possibility of enantiomers. Biphenyls can have axial chirality, which is a form of chirality arising from the arrangement of substituents around the central bond. So if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group and a COOCH3 in para positions. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are across from each other. So the nitro and COOCH3 are opposite each other on each ring.

Now, the central bond (connecting 1 and 1') allows rotation. So, substituents on opposite rings can be arranged in a way that creates a non-symmetrical molecule.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that when looking from the top, the nitro and COOCH3 on each ring are in the same relative positions, then the molecule might be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So in that case, it wouldn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not sure. So perhaps I should think about whether the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical.

Wait, nitro and COOCH3 are different groups. So on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, but the groups are different. So when you look at the entire molecule, the arrangement of the substituents might lead to a lack of symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe each substituent on one ring is opposite a substituent of the same type on the other ring. For example, on the first ring, substituents are nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. On the second ring, substituents are nitro at 6' and COOCH3 at 2'. So if the substituents are arranged such that nitro on ring A is opposite to nitro on ring B, then the molecule would be symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is such that the substituents are opposite each other, leading to a plane of symmetry. Thus, the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that each nitro is next to a COOCH3 on the adjacent ring, then the molecule might be asymmetrical, leading to chirality.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the central bond, making it achiral. So each substituent on one ring is mirrored on the other ring, leading to symmetry.

If that's the case, then the molecule is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, in this scenario, compound 1 would not show optical isomerism.

So, among the four compounds, only number 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Let me review the options.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4 → No, because 4 is no.

B)3 and 4 → No, both are no.

C) 2 and 3 → 2 is yes, 3 is no.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is no, 2 is yes.

But according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. But the options don't have an option that includes only 2. Wait, looking back at the options given:

Options:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B)3 and 4

C)2 and 3

D)1 and 2

So, none of the options include only 2. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. Oh wait, the question asks which of the four compounds show optical isomerism. So it's possible that more than one is correct, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, despite being symmetrical, it might have some sort of stereochemistry. Wait, but I thought it was symmetrical, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is the trans diastereomer, but if the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't be chiral. So perhaps 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate is not symmetrical. Let me think again about the structure.

Fumarate is the trans (E) isomer of maleate. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure would be:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the substituents are on opposite sides, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. So yes, the molecule is symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

So, back to the problem. Only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 1 has a chiral center.

Wait, but in compound 1, the substituents are on the benzene rings. Benzene rings are flat, so the substituents would be in the plane. So, unless the arrangement leads to a chiral center elsewhere, perhaps not.

Wait, but the ester groups are at position 2 on each ring. So, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para. So perhaps the entire molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center in the central portion, but that's unlikely because the central bond is a single bond between two carbons in the rings.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 4. Another approach: are any of the structures capable of having enantiomers?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that dimethyl fumarate is actually the same as dimethyl maleate but in the trans configuration, but whether that leads to chirality.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to look for which of the compounds have a chiral center.

Compound 2: definitely a chiral center.

Compound 1: No chiral centers? Because the substituents are on benzene rings. Benzene rings can't have chiral centers because they're flat, and the attached groups are in a plane.

Wait, but perhaps the ester groups are attached in such a way that the molecule as a whole becomes chiral. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it not chiral.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to proceed.

So, according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option with only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate has two COOCH3 groups attached to double bond. So, the structure is (COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). Wait, no, that's the same as (COOCH3)2C-CH2, which isn't correct.

Wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, that's not right. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The dimethyl ester would replace the Hs with OCH3 groups. So, it's (CH2) groups with COOCH3 on each end of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3). No, that's not a double bond.

Wait, the correct structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H → esterification gives OMe groups. So, it's OMeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3

But that's for succinic acid. For fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
    |
CH2=CH-CO-OCH3

Wait, that can't be right. Fumarate is the trans isomer, so the double bond is between the two carbons that each have COOCH3 groups.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, but that would make the molecule symmetrical. So, each end has the same group, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so I think I'm confident that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have just 2. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1.

Wait, let me think again about compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, the substituents on each ring are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other.

Now, on each ring, the substituents are a nitro and a COOCH3. So, each ring has two substituents in para positions. So, on ring A, substituents at 2 and 6 are COOCH3 and nitro. On ring B, substituents at 2' and 6' are COOCH3 and nitro.

Now, considering the entire molecule, the arrangement could have the nitro groups opposite each other, leading to a symmetrical molecule, or perhaps not.

Wait, if the nitro groups are on opposite sides of the central bond, and the ester groups are on the same side, then the molecule could be asymmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. If not, it's chiral. So, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it will be chiral.

But without a clear picture, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the substituents around a single bond are arranged in a non-symmetrical way, making the molecule chiral.

In biphenyls, axial chirality can arise when the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group in para positions. So, if the nitro and COOCH3 on each ring are arranged in a way that their positions relative to each other create an asymmetrical arrangement around the central bond, the molecule would be chiral.

So, if on each ring, the nitro and COOCH3 are on the same side relative to the central bond, then the molecule could be asymmetrical. Alternatively, if they are on opposite sides, it could be symmetrical.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, assuming that the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, if both compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, then the answer would be option D) 1 and 2.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident about compound 1. So, perhaps I should accept that I'm not sure and proceed with the options.

Wait, the question says, which of the following show optical isomerism. So, if both 1 and 2 exhibit it, then option D is correct.

But earlier, I thought that compound 1 is symmetrical, so it doesn't. But perhaps it is asymmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetric, leading to optical isomerism.

In that case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism, and so option D (1 and 2) would be correct.

So, putting it all together:

1: Yes (asymmetric)

2: Yes (chiral center)

4: No

3: No

So, the correct answer would be option D) 1 and 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought 1 was symmetrical, but perhaps it's not. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and 1 doesn't have a chiral center but has axial chirality.

In conclusion, based on the analysis, compounds 2 and 1 would exhibit optical isomerism, leading to option D.


To determine which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality, which requires a chiral center or axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond at the 1,1' positions. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The substituents on each ring are in para positions (2 and 6). The molecule's symmetry depends on the arrangement of the substituents. If the substituents on each ring are arranged asymmetrically relative to the central bond, the molecule can exhibit axial chirality. Thus, this compound can show optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon atom at the second position (CH(OH)) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a methyl group, and an acetyloxy group. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where the carbonyl carbon is doubly bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. Since the carbonyl carbon is not bonded to four different groups, it is not a chiral center. The molecule is symmetrical and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure (COOCH3)2C=CH. The molecule is symmetrical due to the identical substituents (COOCH3) on both sides of the double bond, and it has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 exhibits optical isomerism due to axial chirality.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry or the absence of chirality.  

The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.
