Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method, and I need to figure out which planet is more likely to transit, so the researchers should prioritize observing that one. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, what do I remember about the transit method? Oh right, when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question states both planets have the same mass. But other factors matter too. The question gives me some data:

- Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. That probably means Planet_1 is closer to its star since it has a shorter orbital period.

- Both host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive (twice as much as Planet_2's star). Wait, but if the stars have the same radius, how does the mass come into play? Hmm, more massive stars might be brighter, but here their radii are same, so maybe that affects other factors, like the planet's size relative to the star.

Wait, the question is about the probability of a transit. I think the transit probability is mainly determined by the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight, which is a statistical factor. But wait, another important factor is the size of the planet relative to the star. A larger planet or a smaller star increases the chance of a detectable transit. Oh wait, but here both stars have the same radius, so that part stays the same.

Wait, no. The planet's size relative to the star's size affects the depth of the transit, but the probability is more about the orbital inclination. But wait, no, the probability is actually about the geometry. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit would cause a transit is about (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital size to the star's size? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty.

Wait, the transit probability for a given system is given by the formula: P = (R_planet + R_star) / a * (something?), or maybe it's more about the alignment. Oh wait, from what I remember, the probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_star + R_planet)/(a * (1 - e²)^0.5)), but assuming circular orbits, so e=0, so it's (R_star + R_planet)/a. But wait, no, actually, I think the probability is approximately (R_planet + R_star) / a, but more accurately, the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a (1 + ... )) Hmm, I might be getting this wrong.

Alternatively, another approach: for a planet with orbital period P around a star, the orbit's semi-major axis a can be found using Kepler's third law. But since the host stars have different masses but same radius, let's think about that.

Wait, Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) a³. Since both planets are detected via RV, their masses are known, but the question says they have the same minimum mass. But for this, since it's an Earth-like planet, their masses are similar, but their periods are different.

Given that, the semi-major axis a is related to the period and the mass of the star. So for a planet with period P around a star of mass M, a³ = (G M P²)/(4 π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

But in the question, Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Let's denote M1 = 2 M2.

So for a1 (Planet_1's semi-major axis):

a1³ = (G * M1 * (P1)² ) / (4 π²)

Similarly, a2³ = (G * M2 * (P2)² ) / (4 π² )

Dividing a1³ by a2³:

(a1/a2)³ = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²)
= (2) * ( (P2/3)² / P2² )
= 2 * (1/9)
= 2/9

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculating (2/9)^(1/3): 2 is 2, 9 is 3². So 2/9 = (2)/(3²) = 2/(3^2) → cube root of (2/9) is cube_root(2)/cube_root(9) → which is approximately 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Wait, but what does this mean? The semi-major axis is smaller for Planet_1 because it's orbiting a more massive star and has a shorter period. So Planet_1 is closer in to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

But for transit probability, the key is the ratio of the size of the planet's orbit to the star's size. Wait, no. The transit probability depends on the geometric probability, which is (R_planet + R_star) / a × sin(i), but sin(i) averages to 1 when considering random orientations. So the probability is approximately (R_planet + R_star) / a.

Wait, but in the problem, the stars have the same radius, but what about the planets? Wait, the question says both are Earth-like, so same radius as Earth? I think so. So R_planet is same for both.

So the transit probability P is proportional to (R_planet + R_star) / a.

But both stars have the same R, so R_planet + R_star is same for both.

So P is inversely proportional to a. So, the planet with smaller a has higher transit probability.

Because a is smaller, P is higher.

So which planet has smaller a? Planet_1, because a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So Planet_1 has higher probability, but wait, let me get back to the question.

Wait, the question says both host stars have the same radii. So for both planets, R_planet is same, so (R_p + R_s) is same, as R_s is same. So for transit probability, it's (R_p + R_s)/a. So lower a → higher probability.

So since a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1's (R_p + R_s)/a is larger, so higher probability.

Wait, but wait! Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius to the semi-major axis. So P = (R_s + R_p)/a.

But if a is smaller, that ratio is larger, so higher probability.

So Planet_1's a is smaller, so it has higher probability.

So why is the question giving options that have higher probabilities for Planet_2?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the a ratio.

M1 = 2*M2.

P1 = (1/3) P2.

So a1³ = (G*M1*P1²)/(4π²) = (G*(2 M2)*( (P2/3)^2 )) / (4 π² )

a2³ = (G M2 P2²) / (4 π² )

Dividing a1³ by a2³:

(2 M2 * (P2²/9)) / (M2 P2²) ) = (2/9)

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

Wait, (2/9) is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6, yes.

So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So for transit probability, P1 = (R_s + R_p) / a1.

P2 = (R_s + R_p) / a2.

So P1/P2 = (a2) / (a1) ) = 1/0.6 → approx 1.666... times.

So P1 is about 1.67 times higher than P2.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the calculation is more precise.

Cube root of (2/9) is exact value.

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

Let me compute it numerically.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222.

We know that cube root of 0.125 is 0.5 (0.5^3=0.125), cube root of 0.216 is 0.6 (0.6^3=0.216). So 0.222 is a bit more than 0.6.

Let me compute 0.6^3=0.216. 0.605^3: 0.605 *0.605 = approx 0.366. 0.366 * 0.605 ≈ 0.221. So 0.605^3≈0.221, which is very close to 2/9≈0.2222. So a1 is approximately 0.605 a2.

So a1/a2 = 0.605.

So (R_s + R_p)/a1 = (same value) / 0.605 a2 → ≈ 1.652 times (R_s + R_p)/a2 = (same) /a2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred, ~1.65 times higher.

Wait, what about the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

Wait, but according to my calculation, Planet_1's probability is higher, so they should pick Planet_1.

So the correct option would be C.

But I need to make sure I didn't miss any factors. Let me think again about the transit probability formula.

The formula for the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is given by:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (1 / (1 + (a / (R_star + R_planet))² )^0.5 )).

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, I've read that the probability is approximately (R_star)/(a) * (assuming R_planet << R_star). Wait, but since both planets are Earth-like, and their stars are similar in radius, perhaps R_planet is not negligible.

Wait, let me think about the correct formula for the transit probability.

The transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where the planet passes in front of the star. This depends on the relative sizes and the alignment of the orbit. The probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, multiplied by (1/(1 + (a/(R_star + R_planet))² )^0.5 )) ? No, perhaps that's not right.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is given by:

P ≈ (R_star + R_planet) / a

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another approach is that when the orbital plane is edge-on, the planet transits. The probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbit, but that's not exactly right either.

Wait, another way: the transit condition occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that its path crosses our line of sight. The probability of this is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a, as this is the ratio of the sizes that determine whether the planet will block the star.

But if a is the semi-major axis, then a is in units of distance. R_star and R_planet are in the same units. So the ratio (R_star + R_planet)/a is a pure number. So for higher a, lower probability.

So yes, Planet_1 has a smaller a, so higher probability.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}} + R_{\text{planet}}}{a}
\]

Here, \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star, and \(R_{\text{planet}}\) is the radius of the planet. Since both planets are Earth-like, \(R_{\text{planet}}\) is the same for both. Additionally, the host stars have the same radius, so \(R_{\text{star}}\) is also the same for both. Thus, the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \(a\). A smaller \(a\) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the mass of the host star \(M_{\text{star}}\) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1, the host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)), and Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter (\(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\)). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2\), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a\), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. Specifically:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

Wait, Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M_star)) a³. Since both planets are detected via RV, their masses are known, but the question says they have the same minimum mass. But for this, since it's an Earth-like planet, their masses are similar, but their periods are different.

Given that, the semi-major axis a is related to the period and the mass of the star. So for a planet with period P around a star of mass M, a³ = (G M P²)/(4 π²). So a is proportional to (M P²)^(1/3).

But in the question, Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So P1 = P2 /3. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Let's denote M1 = 2 M2.

So for a1 (Planet_1's semi-major axis):

a1³ = (G * M1 * (P1)² ) / (4 π²)

Similarly, a2³ = (G * M2 * (P2)² ) / (4 π² )

Dividing a1³ by a2³:

(a1/a2)³ = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²)
= (2) * ( (P2/3)² / P2² )
= 2 * (1/9)
= 2/9

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3)

Calculating (2/9)^(1/3): 2 is 2, 9 is 3². So 2/9 = (2)/(3²) = 2/(3^2) → cube root of (2/9) is cube_root(2)/cube_root(9) → which is approximately 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Wait, but what does this mean? The semi-major axis is smaller for Planet_1 because it's orbiting a more massive star and has a shorter period. So Planet_1 is closer in to its star than Planet_2 is to its.

The transit probability depends on the geometric probability, which is (R_planet + R_star) / a × sin(i), but sin(i) averages to 1 when considering random orientations.

So the transit probability P is proportional to (R_planet + R_star) / a.

But both stars have the same R, so R_planet + R_star is same for both.

So P is inversely proportional to a. So, the planet with smaller a has higher transit probability.

Because a is smaller, P is higher.

So which planet has smaller a? Planet_1, because a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So Planet_1 has higher probability, but wait, let me get back to the question.

Wait, the question says both host stars have the same radii. So for both planets, R_planet is same, so (R_p + R_s) is same, as R_s is same. So for transit probability, it's (R_p + R_s)/a. So lower a → higher probability.

So since a1 is smaller than a2, Planet_1's (R_p + R_s)/a is larger, so higher probability.

Wait, but wait! Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius plus the planet's radius to the semi-major axis. So P = (R_s + R_p)/a.

But if a is smaller, that ratio is larger, so higher probability.

So Planet_1's a is smaller, so it has higher probability.

So why is the question giving options that have higher probabilities for Planet_2?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute the a ratio.

M1 = 2*M2.

P1 = (1/3) P2.

So a1³ = (G*M1*P1²)/(4π²) = (G*(2 M2)*( (P2/3)^2 )) / (4 π² )

a2³ = (G M2 P2²) / (4 π² )

Dividing a1³ by a2³:

(2 M2 * (P2²/9)) / (M2 P2²) ) = (2/9)

So a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

Wait, (2/9) is about 0.222. Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.6, yes.

So a1 is about 0.6 a2.

So for transit probability, P1 = (R_s + R_p) / a1.

P2 = (R_s + R_p) / a2.

So P1/P2 = (a2) / (a1) ) = 1/0.6 → approx 1.666... times.

So P1 is about 1.67 times higher than P2.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is higher.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the calculation is more precise.

Cube root of (2/9) is exact value.

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

Let me compute it numerically.

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222.

We know that cube root of 0.125 is 0.5 (0.5^3=0.125), cube root of 0.216 is 0.6 (0.6^3=0.216). So 0.222 is a bit more than 0.6.

Let me compute 0.6^3=0.216. 0.605^3: 0.605 *0.605 = approx 0.366. 0.366 * 0.605 ≈ 0.221. So 0.605^3≈0.221, which is very close to 2/9≈0.2222. So a1 is approximately 0.605 a2.

So a1/a2 = 0.605.

So (R_s + R_p)/a1 = (same value) / 0.605 a2 → ≈ 1.652 times (R_s + R_p)/a2 = (same) /a2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred, ~1.65 times higher.

Wait, what about the options:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option A) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 times higher probability.

Wait, but according to my calculation, Planet_1's probability is higher, so they should pick Planet_1.

So the correct option would be C.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}} + R_{\text{planet}}}{a}
\]

Here, \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the radius of the host star, and \(R_{\text{planet}}\) is the radius of the planet. Since both planets are Earth-like, \(R_{\text{planet}}\) is the same for both. Additionally, the host stars have the same radius, so \(R_{\text{star}}\) is also the same for both. Thus, the transit probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \(a\). A smaller \(a\) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \(a\) is related to the orbital period \(P\) and the mass of the host star \(M_{\text{star}}\) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1, the host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\(M_1 = 2M_2\)), and Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter (\(P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3}\)). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 \cdot P_1^2}{M_2 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2\), meaning Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's. Since transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a\), Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. Specifically:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.

Answer: C
