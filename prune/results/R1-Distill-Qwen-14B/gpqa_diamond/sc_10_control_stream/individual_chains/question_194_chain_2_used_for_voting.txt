Okay, I've got this physics problem about spins and partition functions. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the problem says we've got three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So first, I need to figure out all the possible states of the system and their corresponding energies.

Each spin has two possible states: +1 or -1. So with three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 =8. Let me list them all. 

Let me denote each state as (S1, S2, S3), with each S being ±1. So the states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E. The formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term.

Let me compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.

State 1: All spins +1.
S1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1
Same for S1S3 and S2S3. So sum is 1+1+1=3.
E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2=1, S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (-1).
Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.
E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.
E = J.

State 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3= (+1).
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.
E = J.

Wait, let me double-check that. S2 and S3 are both -1, so S2S3 is (+1). So yes, sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E= J.

State 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.
S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
S2S3 = (+1)(+1) )= +1.
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.
E= J.

State 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2 = (-1)(+1) =-1.
S1S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1.
S2S3 = (+1)(-1) =-1.
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.
E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2 = (+1) (since (-1)(-1)=1).
S1S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1.
S2S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1.
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1.
E= J.

State8: All spins -1.
S1S2 = (+1), same for all three terms.
Sum is 1+1+1=3.
E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait a minute, so looking at the states:

Only states 1 and 8 have E = -3J and +3J? Wait, no, wait. Wait let me check again.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is E = -J [sum terms].

So for state 1: sum terms =3. So E = -3J.

For state 8: sum terms=3, so E= -3J *3? No, wait, same as state 1. Because all are -1, so S1S2 is (+1), same for the others. So sum is 3. So E= -3J *1? No, wait, E= -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, no, for state 8: each S is -1, so S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1, same for others. Sum is 3, so E= -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, same as state1. So states 1 and 8 both have E= -3J, but wait no. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute for state 8 again.

Wait, in state8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

So S1S2 = (-1)(-1) =1. Same for S1S3 and S2S3. So sum is 1+1+1=3.

So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, same for state1. Both have E= -3J. So they are the same energy.

Then, all other states (2-7) have E= J. Because in each, the sum is -1, so E= J.

Wait, no. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait for state2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. So E= -J*(-1)= J.

Same for state3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2= -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J.

Wait, same for state4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= (+1) because (-1)(-1)=1. So sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E= J.

Similarly, state5: sum is -1, E= J.

State6: sum=-1, E= J.

State7: sum=-1, E= J.

So total:

States:

1: E=-3J.

2: E= J.

3: E= J.

4: E= J.

5: E= J.

6: E= J.

7: E= J.

8: E=-3J.

So in total, two states have E=-3J, and six states have E=J.

Therefore, when we compute the partition function Z, each state contributes exp(-β E). So for E=-3J, exp(-β*(-3J))=exp(3β J). For E=J, exp(-β*(J))=exp(-β J).

So how many states are there with each E?

Two states with E=-3J: each contributes e^{3β J}.

Six states with E=J: each contributes e^{-β J}.

So the total partition function Z is 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Z=2e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ}

Wait, that's 2 with exp(-3β J) and 6 with exp(β J). But in our case, it's 2 exp(3β J) and 6 exp(-β J). So option A is not correct.

Option B) Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → this matches what I have. So option B is 2 exp(3β J) +6 exp(-β J).

Wait, wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ)
Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ)
Option C: 2e^(2Jβ) +6e^(-2Jβ)
Option D: 6 e^(2Jβ) +2e^(-2Jβ)

So according to my calculation, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the energies. Because sometimes when I'm tired, I make mistakes in the signs.

Wait, the energy is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So when S1S2 + ... is positive, E is negative. So for maximum positive sum, E is most negative.

In state1 and state8, the sum is 3, so E = -3J.

In other states, the sum is -1, so E= J.

So the energies are correct.

So Z is sum over all states of e^{-β E}.

So for each state 1 and 8:

e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3β J}.

Each of the other 6 states contribute e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the partition function is defined as \( Z = \sum e^{-\beta E} \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states for the three spins. These states are:
1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \)
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \)
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \)
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \)
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \)
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \)
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \)

### Step 2: Calculate the energy for each state
The energy is \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). For each state:
- **States 1 and 8**: All spins are aligned (\( S_1S_2 = S_1S_3 = S_2S_3 = 1 \)), so \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \). Thus, \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).
- **States 2–7**: The spins are partially aligned, and \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \). Thus, \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

### Step 3: Compute the contributions to \( Z \)
For each state, the contribution to \( Z \) is \( e^{-\beta E} \):
- For states 1 and 8 (\( E = -3J \)): \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3\beta J} \).
- For states 2–7 (\( E = J \)): \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus:
- States 1 and 8 contribute \( 2e^{3\beta J} \).
- States 2–7 contribute \( 6e^{-\beta J} \).

### Step 4: Write the partition function
The total partition function is:
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are swapped).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, incorrect exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, incorrect coefficients and exponents).

**Answer: B**

Okay, I've got this physics problem about spins and partition functions. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the problem says we've got three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So first, I need to figure out all the possible states of the system and their corresponding energies.

Each spin has two possible states: +1 or -1. So with three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 =8. Let me list them all. 

Let me denote each state as (S1, S2, S3), with each S being ±1. So the states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E. The formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute each term.

Let me compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.

State 1: All spins +1.
S1S2 = (+1)(+1)=1
Same for S1S3 and S2S3. So sum is 1+1+1=3.
E = -J*(3) = -3J.

State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2=1, S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (-1).
Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1.
E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2 = -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1.
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.
E = J.

State 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2 = -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3= (+1).
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.
E = J.

Wait, let me double-check that. S2 and S3 are both -1, so S2S3 is (+1). So yes, sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E= J.

State 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.
S1S2 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
S1S3 = (-1)(+1) = -1.
S2S3 = (+1)(+1) )= +1.
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1.
E= J.

State 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2 = (-1)(+1) =-1.
S1S3 = (-1)(-1)=+1.
S2S3 = (+1)(-1) =-1.
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1.
E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2 = (+1) (since (-1)(-1)=1).
S1S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1.
S2S3 = (-1)(+1)=-1.
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1.
E= J.

State8: All spins -1.
S1S2 = (+1), same for all three terms.
Sum is 1+1+1=3.
E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait a minute, so looking at the states:

Only states 1 and 8 have E = -3J and +3J? Wait, no, wait. Wait let me check again.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is E = -J [sum terms].

So for state 1: sum terms =3. So E = -3J.

For state 8: sum terms=3, so E= -3J *3? No, wait, same as state 1. Because all are -1, so S1S2 is (+1), same for the others. So sum is 3. So E= -3J *1? No, wait, E= -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, no, for state 8: each S is -1, so S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1, same for others. Sum is 3, so E= -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, same as state1. So states 1 and 8 both have E= -3J, but wait no. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute for state 8 again.

Wait, in state8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

So S1S2 = (-1)(-1) =1. Same for S1S3 and S2S3. So sum is 1+1+1=3.

So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

Wait, same for state1. Both have E= -3J. So they are the same energy.

Then, all other states (2-7) have E= J. Because in each, the sum is -1, so E= J.

Wait, no. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait for state2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. So E= -J*(-1)= J.

Same for state3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2= -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. So E= J.

Wait, same for state4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2= -1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= (+1) because (-1)(-1)=1. So sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. So E= J.

Similarly, state5: sum is -1, E= J.

State6: sum=-1, E= J.

State7: sum=-1, E= J.

So total:

States:

1: E=-3J.

2: E= J.

3: E= J.

4: E= J.

5: E= J.

6: E= J.

7: E= J.

8: E=-3J.

So in total, two states have E=-3J, and six states have E=J.

Therefore, when we compute the partition function Z, each state contributes exp(-β E). So for E=-3J, exp(-β*(-3J))=exp(3β J). For E=J, exp(-β*(J))=exp(-β J).

So how many states are there with each E?

Two states with E=-3J: each contributes e^{3β J}.

Six states with E=J: each contributes e^{-β J}.

So the total partition function Z is 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}.

Looking at the options:

Option A) Z=2e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ}

Wait, that's 2 with exp(-3β J) and 6 with exp(β J). But in our case, it's 2 exp(3β J) and 6 exp(-β J). So option A is not correct.

Option B) Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → this matches what I have. So option B is 2 exp(3β J) +6 exp(-β J).

Wait, wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ)
Option B: 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ)
Option C: 2e^(2Jβ) +6e^(-2Jβ)
Option D: 6 e^(2Jβ) +2e^(-2Jβ)

So according to my calculation, option B is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the energies. Because sometimes when I'm tired, I make mistakes in the signs.

Wait, the energy is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So when S1S2 + ... is positive, E is negative. So for maximum positive sum, E is most negative.

In state1 and state8, the sum is 3, so E = -3J.

In other states, the sum is -1, so E= J.

So the energies are correct.

So Z is sum over all states of e^{-β E}.

So for each state 1 and 8:

e^{-β*(-3J)} = e^{3β J}.

Each of the other 6 states contribute e^{-β J}.

So Z = 2 * e^{3β J} + 6 * e^{-β J}.

Looking at the options, that's option B.


To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \), and the partition function is defined as \( Z = \sum e^{-\beta E} \), where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \).

### Step 1: Enumerate all possible states
There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states for the three spins. These states are:
1. \( (+1, +1, +1) \)
2. \( (+1, +1, -1) \)
3. \( (+1, -1, +1) \)
4. \( (+1, -1, -1) \)
5. \( (-1, +1, +1) \)
6. \( (-1, +1, -1) \)
7. \( (-1, -1, +1) \)
8. \( (-1, -1, -1) \)

### Step 2: Calculate the energy for each state
The energy is \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). For each state:
- **States 1 and 8**: All spins are aligned (\( S_1S_2 = S_1S_3 = S_2S_3 = 1 \)), so \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \). Thus, \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).
- **States 2–7**: The spins are partially aligned, and \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \). Thus, \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

### Step 3: Compute the contributions to \( Z \)
For each state, the contribution to \( Z \) is \( e^{-\beta E} \):
- For states 1 and 8 (\( E = -3J \)): \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{3\beta J} \).
- For states 2–7 (\( E = J \)): \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{-\beta J} \).

Thus:
- States 1 and 8 contribute \( 2e^{3\beta J} \).
- States 2–7 contribute \( 6e^{-\beta J} \).

### Step 4: Write the partition function
The total partition function is:
\[
Z = 2e^{3\beta J} + 6e^{-\beta J}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
Comparing with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect, as the signs of the exponents are swapped).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct, matches the derived expression).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, incorrect exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect, incorrect coefficients and exponents).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
