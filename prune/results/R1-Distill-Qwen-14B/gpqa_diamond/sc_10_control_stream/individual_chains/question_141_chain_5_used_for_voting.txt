Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. No, wait, the 'd' notation usually refers to something else. Oh, right! The 'd' stands for the deuterium. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have a deuterium (D) in position 2. Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 2. So position 1 is bromine, and position 2 is a deuterium. So it's para-bromobenzene with a deuterium at the ortho position. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-d, which would be adjacent positions. Wait, perhaps the structure is bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring.

But wait, the 'd' in the name might indicate that it's a deuterated compound. Ah, right, I've heard of that before. So, 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So the benzene ring has Br in position 1, D in position 2, and the other positions are hydrogen.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure. Benzene has six positions. 1-bromobenzene would have Br at position 1. Then, 2-d would mean position 2 is deuterated. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at the ortho position relative to Br.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I know that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But in what context?

Wait, benzene rings can undergo various reactions. Since the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent. But wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions, especially with compounds that have acidic protons.

In aromatic chemistry, when you have a substituent that can activate the ring towards certain reactions, but wait, Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deactivate the ring towards electrophilic substitution. But deuterium is just a hydrogen isotope; it doesn't have a strong effect on the ring's reactivity compared to hydrogen, but is slightly different in mass.

Wait, but in some cases, especially when dealing with deuterium, the reaction might involve hydrogen/deuterium exchange or some kind of isotope effect.

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 (sodium amide) is a strong base, used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, like the elimination of H-X from haloarenes. Wait, but here the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative.

Wait, another possibility: maybe this is a case of aromatic substitution, but using the base to abstract a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to some kind of elimination or ring modification.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a benzene ring undergoing a substitution reaction. Wait, but Br is a meta director in electrophilic substitution. But wait, NaNH2 isn't an electrophilic reagent. It's a base, so maybe it's more about elimination.

Wait, wait, I remember that in some cases, when you have a bromobenzene and treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination, but wait, that typically requires an adjacent hydrogen. Like in ethyl bromide, elimination gives ethylene. So in benzene, if there's a Br and adjacent H, eliminating HBr would form a double bond. But benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with aliphatic elimination.

Wait, another possibility: aromatic substitution where the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzyne intermediate. Oh right! The formation of benzyne (aryne) via dehydrohalogenation. That's a reaction I remember. So when you have a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dihalobenzene, and treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, you can eliminate two equivalents of HX to form benzyne, a triple bond in the ring.

But wait, in this case, the molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So there's only one Br and a D in the adjacent position. So, does that mean there's only one H adjacent to Br? Let me think. So the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the adjacent positions to Br are position 2 and position 6. Position 2 has a D, so no H there. Position 6 has H.

So, when NaNH2 is added, the base might abstract a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br. But wait, Br is at position 1, and the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, so position 6 is H.

So, the base (NH2^- ) would abstract the H from position 6. Then, with the Br leaving, we would eliminate HBr, but wait, but there's only one Br. Wait, elimination requires two adjacent X groups, right? Or is there another scenario?

Wait, maybe in this case, only one elimination is possible. Let me think. For benzyne formation, you typically need two adjacent leaving groups, like two bromines. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with NaNH2 would lose 2 HBr to form benzyne.

But in this case, we have only one Br. So maybe the reaction can't form benzyne. Hmm, but wait, the molecule has a Br and a D in adjacent positions. So perhaps the D is just a hydrogen isotope; when the base abstracts the H from position 6, Br could leave, but you need another X for elimination. Wait, but Br is the only leaving group here.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about this. Alternatively, perhaps the D is just a regular hydrogen but is deuterated. So when the base comes in, it might abstract the H from position 6 (as the D is in position 2 and perhaps not abstractable?), leading to a benzyne-like structure, but with only one Br elimination. Wait, but for a triple bond in the ring, you need two eliminations. So maybe this doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about elimination but something else. Maybe it's a substitution reaction. But Br is a poor leaving group under basic conditions. Wait, unless it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups. Br is a deactivating group, so nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings with Br is not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, making a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could attack something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the D is important here. Let's think: the molecule has a Br and a D adjacent. So when the base approaches, it can abstract the H from position 6 (which is adjacent to Br). But wait, the D is in position 2, so maybe the base can't abstract that. So when the base abstracts the H from position 6, maybe the Br can leave, but only one elimination occurs.

Wait, but elimination typically requires two adjacent leaving groups. So without a second leaving group, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination. So maybe this reaction isn't possible, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't about elimination but dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond. But without a second leaving group, can it form a triple bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the D in position 2 is just a regular hydrogen, but with a different isotope. So maybe the base can abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, but that might not be very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes activated in some way.

Wait, another angle: since the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but only one H is available for elimination. So maybe the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. Then, the Br leaves, and the electrons form a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would form a double bond, not a triple bond. Or maybe with another elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion, which could rearrange or form a new structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed.

If the reaction doesn't proceed, the only product would be the starting material. But that's not an option because the options include 1,2,3,4 products.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, and then the Br leaves as Br^- . But that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which is not very stable. Or maybe it leads to a ring expansion or contraction, but that's unlikely in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium plays a role. The D is in position 2, adjacent to Br. So when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the D is in position 2, so maybe the Br is eliminated, leading to a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, let me think. If I have 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. Then, the Br leaves, and the electrons from the C-Br bond form a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would form a double bond. But in a benzene ring, all bonds are equivalent, so perhaps this doesn't lead to a new product.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 2. But position 2 has a D, not H. So maybe the base can't abstract that. So the only possible H to abstract is position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, which is known as benzyne or aryne. But wait, to form benzyne, you typically need two adjacent leaving groups, like two bromines. In this case, we have only one Br and a D. So maybe the reaction can't form the triple bond because there's no second leaving group.

Hmm, so perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to a ring contraction or expansion, but that's not common in such reactions.

Wait, I'm probably missing something. Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So it's bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2. So the molecule is Br-C6H4-D. So the substituents are Br at position 1 and D at position 2.

When treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia, which is a strong base, the base would abstract a proton from the ring. Where are the acidic protons?

In aromatic systems, the protons ortho and para to electron-withdrawing groups are more acidic. Here, Br is an electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) protons are more acidic.

But in our case, position 2 has a D, so the available acidic protons are at position 6 (ortho to Br) and position 4 (para to Br).

So NaNH2 could abstract a proton from position 6 or position 4.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1, then the Br could leave, leading to elimination. But for elimination, you need two adjacent leaving groups, right? So in this case, Br is only at position 1, and the base abstracts position 6. So perhaps the C-Br bond breaks, and the H is removed, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But that would form a double bond, but the ring is already aromatic. So maybe this isn't possible because it would disrupt aromaticity.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracting the H leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which isn't stable, so the ring might undergo some kind of reaction.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about possible products. If the base abstracts a proton, say from position 6, then the Br could leave as Br^- , forming a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 1. But that's not stable. Alternatively, maybe the base could deprotonate and cause an elimination, but without a second leaving group, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the product is a ring with a triple bond. But without a second leaving group, how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material, but that doesn't seem right because the options include B)1, which would imply one product.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group, but NaNH2 isn't a good nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation where the Br is eliminated, but without a second leaving group, it's not possible.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The options are 1,2,3,4. So possible products could be based on the position of elimination or substitution.

Wait, another approach: the structure is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When treated with NaNH2, the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br). If the Br then leaves, you get a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would require losing two HBr molecules, but we only have one Br here. So perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the scenario is different. Since the base is strong, perhaps it abstracts a proton that's adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then react in some way. But I'm not sure what the product would be.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening, but I don't think benzene would open under these conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of multiple products due to different positions of elimination.

Wait, the molecule has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the possible sites for deprotonation would be positions 6 (ortho to Br) and position 4 (para to Br). But position 2 is D, so the H there isn't abstractable.

So if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. But without a second leaving group, can this happen?

Wait, wait, perhaps the D in position 2 isn't a leaving group but is just a regular hydrogen. So maybe the base abstracts position 6's H, and the Br leaves, but that would form a single bond, not a triple bond. So perhaps it's just a substitution reaction where Br is replaced by something else. But in this case, NaNH2 isn't a good nucleophile for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, leading to no new product, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't about elimination but isotope exchange. Like, the D could be swapped with H. But I don't think NaNH2 in ammonia would cause that.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products again. If elimination isn't possible, perhaps no reaction occurs, but the options don't include zero. Alternatively, maybe only one product is possible.

Wait, another thought: maybe the presence of the D affects the acidity of the adjacent protons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a carbanion. But that's not a stable structure, so it might not proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide group, but I don't think that's feasible because Br is a poor leaving group under basic conditions, and NaNH2 isn't a good nucleophile.

Wait, but I might be missing something. Let me think about the aromatic ring and the positions again. The Br is at position 1, and D at position 2. So the possible H's that the base can abstract are positions 6 (adjacent to Br) and position 4 (para to Br).

If the base abstracts position 6's H, then the Br could leave, but without a second leaving group, perhaps nothing happens. Alternatively, if the base abstracts position 4's H, which is para to Br, perhaps that leads to some reaction. But I'm not sure what.

Wait, maybe the deprotonation at position 4 leads to a rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 4, but that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts the H from position 6, leading to a benzyne structure. But without a second leaving group, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the D in position 2 acts as a leaving group? No, D is a deuterium, not a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the D doesn't affect the reaction, and the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and H, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But without a second leaving group, that's not possible. So maybe elimination isn't possible, and the reaction doesn't proceed.

But that would mean only the starting material is present, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the D allows for some kind of isotope effect, making the H at position 6 more acidic. So the base abstracts that H, leading to a carbanion at position 6. Then, the Br leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion and a positive charge at position 1? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves as Br^- , and the ring becomes deprotonated. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since the options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products, and the reaction involves deprotonation, perhaps the base abstracts protons from different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, in the starting material, the substituents are Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the possible positions for deprotonation are positions 4 and 6. If the base abstracts position 4's H, that's para to Br. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, but without a second leaving group, elimination isn't possible.

Alternatively, abstracting position 6's H leads to a possible elimination, but without a second Br, maybe nothing happens.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, but only one product because the structure is symmetric.

Wait, considering the molecule, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then elimination of HBr would form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, without a second leaving group, can you form a triple bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but leads to a substituted benzene. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the options don't include that.

Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the possible products again. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then perhaps the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. But that would disrupt aromaticity, which isn't likely.

Alternatively, maybe the ring undergoes some kind of substitution, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but only possible at position 6, leading to benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But I'm not sure if that's possible with only one Br.

Wait, but in reality, to form benzyne (triple bond in benzene), you need two adjacent leaving groups. So without two Brs, this reaction can't proceed. So perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne, and thus no products are formed. But the options don't include zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, so only the starting material is present. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the D is just a hydrogen, so after deprotonation at position 6, elimination of HBr occurs, leaving a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But that would require two adjacent leaving groups, which we don't have. So I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the D isn't a leaving group, but the base can abstract it. No, D is a deuterium, so it doesn't act as a leaving group.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. Oh wait, I think when you have a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dibromobenzene, and treat it with NaNH2, you get benzyne via elimination of two HBr. But in this case, we have only one Br. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a leaving group, but I don't think so. D is just a heavier isotope of H, it doesn't leave.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6, and the Br leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 1. But that's not stable, so perhaps resonance occurs, leading to a ring expansion or contraction, but that's unlikely.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and H, forming a triple bond, but without a second leaving group, perhaps that's not possible. So maybe no reaction occurs, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product because there's only one possible site for elimination. So maybe the answer is B)1.

Wait, but earlier I thought elimination isn't possible without a second leaving group. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question assumes it does, leading to one product. So perhaps the answer is B)1.

Alternatively, if elimination is possible even with one Br, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but that would be one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6 and the Br leaves, but without a second Br, no elimination happens, so the product is a bromobenzene with a deprotonated position 6. But that's a carbanion, which isn't stable, so the reaction doesn't proceed.

I think I'm going in circles. Maybe the correct answer is B)1, implying only one product is formed.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material has bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for deprotonation and elimination reactions. 

Key considerations for the reaction include:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at the ortho position (position 2). This limits the available acidic protons for abstraction by the base, as position 2 is occupied by deuterium (D), and position 6 (ortho to Br) is the only other acidic proton.

2. **Role of NaNH₂**: NaNH₂ acts as a strong base, abstracting acidic protons. In this case, the proton at position 6 (ortho to Br) is the most likely candidate for deprotonation due to the electron-withdrawing effect of bromine.

3. **Elimination Reaction**: For elimination to occur, two adjacent leaving groups are typically required. However, the starting material has only one bromine atom, making the formation of a benzyne intermediate (a triple bond in the benzene ring) unlikely. Without a second leaving group, elimination cannot proceed as expected.

4. **Possible Products**: 
   - If the base abstracts the proton at position 6, the bromine could theoretically leave, but this would not lead to a stable product due to the lack of a second leaving group for elimination.
   - The reaction may not proceed under these conditions, leaving only the starting material as the product. However, this scenario is not explicitly listed in the options.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 4**: This would imply multiple distinct products, which is unlikely given the structure and reaction conditions.
   - **B) 1**: This suggests only one product is formed. If the reaction does not proceed, the starting material remains unchanged, but this is not explicitly stated in the question.
   - **C) 2**: This would require two distinct reaction pathways, which is not supported by the reaction mechanism.
   - **D) 3**: This would require three distinct products, which is also unsupported.

Given the constraints of the reaction and the options provided, the most plausible conclusion is that only one product is formed, likely due to the reaction not proceeding as expected or forming a single intermediate.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, I think it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. No, wait, the 'd' notation usually refers to something else. Oh, right! The 'd' stands for the deuterium. So 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have a deuterium (D) in position 2. Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, benzene with substituents at positions 1 and 2. So position 1 is bromine, and position 2 is a deuterium. So it's para-bromobenzene with a deuterium at the ortho position. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-d, which would be adjacent positions. Wait, perhaps the structure is bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring.

But wait, the 'd' in the name might indicate that it's a deuterated compound. Ah, right, I've heard of that before. So, 1-bromobenzene-2-d would have bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. So the benzene ring has Br in position 1, D in position 2, and the other positions are hydrogen.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure. Benzene has six positions. 1-bromobenzene would have Br at position 1. Then, 2-d would mean position 2 is deuterated. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at the ortho position relative to Br.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I know that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But in what context?

Wait, benzene rings can undergo various reactions. Since the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent. But wait, NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base and can cause elimination reactions, especially with compounds that have acidic protons.

In aromatic chemistry, when you have a substituent that can activate the ring towards certain reactions, but wait, Br is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deactivate the ring towards electrophilic substitution. But deuterium is just a hydrogen isotope; it doesn't have a strong effect on the ring's reactivity compared to hydrogen, but is slightly different in mass.

Wait, but in some cases, especially when dealing with deuterium, the reaction might involve hydrogen/deuterium exchange or some kind of isotope effect.

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 (sodium amide) is a strong base, used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, like the elimination of H-X from haloarenes. Wait, but here the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative.

Wait, another possibility: maybe this is a case of aromatic substitution, but using the base to abstract a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to some kind of elimination or ring modification.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a benzene ring undergoing a substitution reaction. Wait, but Br is a meta director in electrophilic substitution. But wait, NaNH2 isn't an electrophilic reagent. It's a base, so maybe it's more about elimination.

Wait, wait, I remember that in some cases, when you have a bromobenzene and treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, it can undergo elimination, but wait, that typically requires an adjacent hydrogen. Like in ethyl bromide, elimination gives ethylene. So in benzene, if there's a Br and adjacent H, eliminating HBr would form a double bond. But benzene is already a ring with conjugated double bonds. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with aliphatic elimination.

Wait, another possibility: aromatic substitution where the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzyne intermediate. Oh right! The formation of benzyne (aryne) via dehydrohalogenation. That's a reaction I remember. So when you have a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dihalobenzene, and treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, you can eliminate two equivalents of HX to form benzyne, a triple bond in the ring.

But wait, in this case, the molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So there's only one Br and a D in the adjacent position. So, does that mean there's only one H adjacent to Br? Let me think. So the benzene ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the adjacent positions to Br are position 2 and position 6. Position 2 has a D, so no H there. Position 6 has H.

So, when NaNH2 is added, the base might abstract a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br. But wait, Br is at position 1, and the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Position 2 is D, so position 6 is H.

So, the base (NH2^- ) would abstract the H from position 6. Then, with the Br leaving, we would eliminate HBr, but wait, but there's only one Br. Wait, elimination requires two adjacent X groups, right? Or is there another scenario?

Wait, maybe in this case, only one elimination is possible. Let me think. For benzyne formation, you typically need two adjacent leaving groups, like two bromines. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with NaNH2 would lose 2 HBr to form benzyne.

But in this case, we have only one Br. So maybe the reaction can't form benzyne. Hmm, but wait, the molecule has a Br and a D in adjacent positions. So perhaps the D is just a hydrogen isotope; when the base abstracts the H from position 6, Br could leave, but you need another X for elimination. Wait, but Br is the only leaving group here.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about this. Alternatively, perhaps the D is just a regular hydrogen but is deuterated. So when the base comes in, it might abstract the H from position 6 (as the D is in position 2 and perhaps not abstractable?), leading to a benzyne-like structure, but with only one Br elimination. Wait, but for a triple bond in the ring, you need two eliminations. So maybe this doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't about elimination but something else. Maybe it's a substitution reaction. But Br is a poor leaving group under basic conditions. Wait, unless it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups. Br is a deactivating group, so nucleophilic substitution on aromatic rings with Br is not common.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the ring, making a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could attack something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the D is important here. Let's think: the molecule has a Br and a D adjacent. So when the base approaches, it can abstract the H from position 6 (which is adjacent to Br). But wait, the D is in position 2, so maybe the base can't abstract that. So when the base abstracts the H from position 6, maybe the Br can leave, but only one elimination occurs.

Wait, but elimination typically requires two adjacent leaving groups. So without a second leaving group, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as elimination. So maybe this reaction isn't possible, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't about elimination but dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond. But without a second leaving group, can it form a triple bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the D in position 2 is just a regular hydrogen, but with a different isotope. So maybe the base can abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, but that might not be very stable. Alternatively, perhaps the ring becomes activated in some way.

Wait, another angle: since the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but only one H is available for elimination. So maybe the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, how would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. Then, the Br leaves, and the electrons form a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would form a double bond, not a triple bond. Or maybe with another elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion, which could rearrange or form a new structure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed.

If the reaction doesn't proceed, the only product would be the starting material. But that's not an option because the options include 1,2,3,4 products.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge, and then the Br leaves as Br^- . But that would form a benzene ring with a negative charge, which is not very stable. Or maybe it leads to a ring expansion or contraction, but that's unlikely in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium plays a role. The D is in position 2, adjacent to Br. So when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the D is in position 2, so maybe the Br is eliminated, leading to a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, let me think. If I have 1-bromo-2-d benzene, and the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. Then, the Br leaves, and the electrons from the C-Br bond form a double bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would form a double bond. But in a benzene ring, all bonds are equivalent, so perhaps this doesn't lead to a new product.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 2. But position 2 has a D, not H. So maybe the base can't abstract that. So the only possible H to abstract is position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, which is known as benzyne or aryne. But wait, to form benzyne, you typically need two adjacent leaving groups, like two bromines. In this case, we have only one Br and a D. So maybe the reaction can't form the triple bond because there's no second leaving group.

Hmm, so perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option either. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to a ring contraction or expansion, but that's not common in such reactions.

Wait, I'm probably missing something. Let me think about the structure again. The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So it's bromobenzene with a deuterium at position 2. So the molecule is Br-C6H4-D. So the substituents are Br at position 1 and D at position 2.

When treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia, which is a strong base, the base would abstract a proton from the ring. Where are the acidic protons?

In aromatic systems, the protons ortho and para to electron-withdrawing groups are more acidic. Here, Br is an electron-withdrawing group, so the ortho (positions 2 and 6) and para (position 4) protons are more acidic.

But in our case, position 2 has a D, so the available acidic protons are at position 6 (ortho to Br) and position 4 (para to Br).

So NaNH2 could abstract a proton from position 6 or position 4.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at position 1, then the Br could leave, leading to elimination. But for elimination, you need two adjacent leaving groups, right? So in this case, Br is only at position 1, and the base abstracts position 6. So perhaps the C-Br bond breaks, and the H is removed, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. But that would form a double bond, but the ring is already aromatic. So maybe this isn't possible because it would disrupt aromaticity.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracting the H leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which isn't stable, so the ring might undergo some kind of reaction.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about possible products. If the base abstracts a proton, say from position 6, then the Br could leave as Br^- , forming a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 1. But that's not stable. Alternatively, maybe the base could deprotonate and cause an elimination, but without a second leaving group, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the product is a ring with a triple bond. But without a second leaving group, how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material, but that doesn't seem right because the options include B)1, which would imply one product.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group, but NaNH2 isn't a good nucleophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation where the Br is eliminated, but without a second leaving group, it's not possible.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The options are 1,2,3,4. So possible products could be based on the position of elimination or substitution.

Wait, another approach: the structure is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. When treated with NaNH2, the base abstracts a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br). If the Br then leaves, you get a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, that would require losing two HBr molecules, but we only have one Br here. So perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the scenario is different. Since the base is strong, perhaps it abstracts a proton that's adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which could then react in some way. But I'm not sure what the product would be.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening, but I don't think benzene would open under these conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of multiple products due to different positions of elimination.

Wait, the molecule has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the possible sites for deprotonation would be positions 6 (ortho to Br) and position 4 (para to Br). But position 2 is D, so the H there isn't abstractable.

So if the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a triple bond between C1 and C2. But without a second leaving group, can this happen?

Wait, wait, perhaps the D in position 2 isn't a leaving group but is just a regular hydrogen. So maybe the base abstracts position 6's H, and the Br leaves, but that would form a single bond, not a triple bond. So perhaps it's just a substitution reaction where Br is replaced by something else. But in this case, NaNH2 isn't a good nucleophile for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, leading to no new product, but that's not an option.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't about elimination but isotope exchange. Like, the D could be swapped with H. But I don't think NaNH2 in ammonia would cause that.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products again. If elimination isn't possible, perhaps no reaction occurs, but the options don't include zero. Alternatively, maybe only one product is possible.

Wait, another thought: maybe the presence of the D affects the acidity of the adjacent protons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a carbanion. But that's not a stable structure, so it might not proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by the amide group, but I don't think that's feasible because Br is a poor leaving group under basic conditions, and NaNH2 isn't a good nucleophile.

Wait, but I might be missing something. Let me think about the aromatic ring and the positions again. The Br is at position 1, and D at position 2. So the possible H's that the base can abstract are positions 6 (adjacent to Br) and position 4 (para to Br).

If the base abstracts position 6's H, then the Br could leave, but without a second leaving group, perhaps nothing happens. Alternatively, if the base abstracts position 4's H, which is para to Br, perhaps that leads to some reaction. But I'm not sure what.

Wait, maybe the deprotonation at position 4 leads to a rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 4, but that doesn't seem likely.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts the H from position 6, leading to a benzyne structure. But without a second leaving group, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the D in position 2 acts as a leaving group? No, D is a deuterium, not a leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the D doesn't affect the reaction, and the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and H, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But without a second leaving group, that's not possible. So maybe elimination isn't possible, and the reaction doesn't proceed.

But that would mean only the starting material is present, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the D allows for some kind of isotope effect, making the H at position 6 more acidic. So the base abstracts that H, leading to a carbanion at position 6. Then, the Br leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion and a positive charge at position 1? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br leaves as Br^- , and the ring becomes deprotonated. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since the options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products, and the reaction involves deprotonation, perhaps the base abstracts protons from different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, in the starting material, the substituents are Br at position 1 and D at position 2. So the possible positions for deprotonation are positions 4 and 6. If the base abstracts position 4's H, that's para to Br. Then, perhaps the Br leaves, but without a second leaving group, elimination isn't possible.

Alternatively, abstracting position 6's H leads to a possible elimination, but without a second Br, maybe nothing happens.

Wait, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, but only one product because the structure is symmetric.

Wait, considering the molecule, if the base abstracts the H from position 6, which is adjacent to Br, then elimination of HBr would form a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, without a second leaving group, can you form a triple bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but leads to a substituted benzene. But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the options don't include that.

Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the possible products again. If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, then perhaps the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. But that would disrupt aromaticity, which isn't likely.

Alternatively, maybe the ring undergoes some kind of substitution, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but only possible at position 6, leading to benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C6. But I'm not sure if that's possible with only one Br.

Wait, but in reality, to form benzyne (triple bond in benzene), you need two adjacent leaving groups. So without two Brs, this reaction can't proceed. So perhaps the reaction doesn't form benzyne, and thus no products are formed. But the options don't include zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, so only the starting material is present. But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the D is just a hydrogen, so after deprotonation at position 6, elimination of HBr occurs, leaving a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But that would require two adjacent leaving groups, which we don't have. So I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the D isn't a leaving group, but the base can abstract it. No, D is a deuterium, so it doesn't act as a leaving group.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for similar reactions. Oh wait, I think when you have a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dibromobenzene, and treat it with NaNH2, you get benzyne via elimination of two HBr. But in this case, we have only one Br. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a leaving group, but I don't think so. D is just a heavier isotope of H, it doesn't leave.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6, and the Br leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 1. But that's not stable, so perhaps resonance occurs, leading to a ring expansion or contraction, but that's unlikely.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a guess. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and H, forming a triple bond, but without a second leaving group, perhaps that's not possible. So maybe no reaction occurs, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product because there's only one possible site for elimination. So maybe the answer is B)1.

Wait, but earlier I thought elimination isn't possible without a second leaving group. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question assumes it does, leading to one product. So perhaps the answer is B)1.

Alternatively, if elimination is possible even with one Br, maybe the product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but that would be one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts the H from position 6 and the Br leaves, but without a second Br, no elimination happens, so the product is a bromobenzene with a deprotonated position 6. But that's a carbanion, which isn't stable, so the reaction doesn't proceed.

I think I'm going in circles. Maybe the correct answer is B)1, implying only one product is formed.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material has bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used for deprotonation and elimination reactions. 

Key considerations for the reaction include:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium at the ortho position (position 2). This limits the available acidic protons for abstraction by the base, as position 2 is occupied by deuterium (D), and position 6 (ortho to Br) is the only other acidic proton.

2. **Role of NaNH₂**: NaNH₂ acts as a strong base, abstracting acidic protons. In this case, the proton at position 6 (ortho to Br) is the most likely candidate for deprotonation due to the electron-withdrawing effect of bromine.

3. **Elimination Reaction**: For elimination to occur, two adjacent leaving groups are typically required. However, the starting material has only one bromine atom, making the formation of a benzyne intermediate (a triple bond in the benzene ring) unlikely. Without a second leaving group, elimination cannot proceed as expected.

4. **Possible Products**: 
   - If the base abstracts the proton at position 6, the bromine could theoretically leave, but this would not lead to a stable product due to the lack of a second leaving group for elimination.
   - The reaction may not proceed under these conditions, leaving only the starting material as the product. However, this scenario is not explicitly listed in the options.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 4**: This would imply multiple distinct products, which is unlikely given the structure and reaction conditions.
   - **B) 1**: This suggests only one product is formed. If the reaction does not proceed, the starting material remains unchanged, but this is not explicitly stated in the question.
   - **C) 2**: This would require two distinct reaction pathways, which is not supported by the reaction mechanism.
   - **D) 3**: This would require three distinct products, which is also unsupported.

Given the constraints of the reaction and the options provided, the most plausible conclusion is that only one product is formed, likely due to the reaction not proceeding as expected or forming a single intermediate.

Answer: B
