Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

The question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector represents the probabilities of the system being in different eigenstates. So first, I probably need to normalize this state because the probabilities must sum to 1.

Wait, the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which means the state isn't normalized. So the actual state vector would be (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. That makes sense because probabilities should sum to 1.

Next, the operators P and Q are given as matrices. I think for each observable, when you measure it, the outcome is an eigenvalue, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. Wait, no, actually, the measurements are P first, then Q. But the problem says, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0, then measuring Q gives -1.

Wait, but when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, when you measure Q on this new state, you get the probability of -1.

Alternatively, maybe the measurements are done in the same state, but that's not what the question says. Wait, no, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the process is: measure P, which gives 0, then measure Q on the resulting state. So the probabilities are sequential.

So the total probability is the product of the probabilities at each step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when you measure P, you get an eigenvalue, and the state becomes the corresponding eigenvector.

Looking at operator P's matrix:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, let me write this matrix more clearly.

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I need to find the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix (P - λ I):

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row.

The determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Simplify each term.

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ) ] → -(1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = (λ)/(2)

Third term is 0.

So putting it all together:

det = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + λ/2

= -λ³ + λ

Set equal to zero: -λ³ + λ = 0 ⇒ λ( -λ² +1 ) =0 → λ (1 - λ²) =0 → λ =0, 1, -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but the problem is about measuring P and getting 0. So the state after measuring P=0 would be the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T, normalized by 1/sqrt(6). Let me denote this state as |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1)^T.

When we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. The probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 in the state |ψ>.

So first, I need to find the eigenvector for λ=0.

Let's solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0, so P|v> = 0.

The matrix P is:

[ 0      1/√2  0     ]
[ 1/√2  0     1/√2 ]
[ 0      1/√2 0     ]

So the equations are:

1) 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

2) (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

3) 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as equation 1, which gives v2=0.

So from these, v2=0. Then v1 = -v3. Let me set v3 = t, so v1 = -t. So the eigenvector is [-t, 0, t]^T, which can be written as t [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. The eigenvector is along the direction (-1, 0, 1).

So the normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

Now, the initial state |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The amplitude for the eigenvector corresponding to 0 is the inner product of |ψ> and |v>, where |v> is the eigenvector for 0.

So compute <v|ψ> = [ -1, 0, 1 ] (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) ) * ( (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 )

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) ) * (1 + 0 +1 ) = (2)/(sqrt(12)) ) = (2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).

The probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the amplitude, which is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

So probability P=0 is 1/3.

Now, upon measuring P=0, the state collapses into the eigenstate |v> for λ=0, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.

Now, we measure Q on this new state. The operator Q has the matrix:

Q = [
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The initial state after P measurement is |v> = (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.

Wait, when you express |v> as a vector, it's (-1, 0, 1) scaled by 1/sqrt(2).

Now, the observable Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors for Q are the standard basis vectors because Q is diagonal.

Specifically:

- Eigenvalue 1: |e1> = (1,0,0)^T.
- Eigenvalue 0: |e2> = (0,1,0)^T.
- Eigenvalue -1: |e3> = (0,0,1)^T.

So the state |v> is in the subspace spanned by |e1> and |e3>, because the middle component is zero.

Express |v> in terms of the eigenstates of Q. Since |v> is ( -1/sqrt(2) , 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

So the components in |e1>, |e2>, |e3> are: (-1/sqrt(2)), 0, and (1/sqrt(2)).

So when we measure Q on |v>, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q, which are 1, 0, -1.

The probability of each outcome is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in |v>.

In this case, the amplitude for eigenvalue 1 is the coefficient of |e1>, which is (-1/sqrt(2)), so the probability is (1/2).

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1, the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2), so probability is (1/2).

Eigenvalue 0 has amplitude 0, so probability 0.

So when we measure Q after P=0, the probabilities are 1/2 for Q=1 and 1/2 for Q=-1.

But in the problem, we're interested in the outcome where Q is -1. So the probability is 1/2.

Wait a minute, but wait: the problem states that the measurement of Q is done just after the measurement of P. So the total probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1, given that P was 0.

Wait, no, it's the joint probability: the probability that P=0 and then Q=-1.

Which would be the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P was 0.

Wait, but in reality, the state after P=0 is known, and the Q measurement is done on that state. So the two probabilities are multiplicative.

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

So looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

1. Initial state |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

2. Compute P's eigenvalues: 0, 1, -1.

3. For λ=0, eigenvector is proportional to (-1, 0, 1)^T.

4. The amplitude is <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ] = (1/(sqrt(12))) )*(2) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).

5. Probability of P=0 is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

6. After P=0, state is |v> = (-1, 0, 1)^T /sqrt(2).

7. Measure Q: Q's eigenstates are the standard basis. The state |v> is a combination of |e1> and |e3>.

8. The coefficient for |e3> (which gives Q=-1) is (1/sqrt(2)), so the probability is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

Multiply the two probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.

The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), on a quantum system. The system's initial state is given as \( | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and the operators \( P \) and \( Q \) are represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to compute the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The matrix for \( P \) is:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Solving for the eigenvalues of \( P \), we find \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the corresponding eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing it, the eigenvector becomes:
\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of \( P = 0 \)
The initial state \( | \psi \rangle \) is normalized as \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |v\rangle \) in \( | \psi \rangle \). The amplitude is:
\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( (-1)(-1) + 0(2) + 1(1) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(P=0) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses into the eigenstate \( |v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Measuring \( Q \)
The matrix for \( Q \) is:
\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors \( |e_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |e_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |e_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively.

The state \( |v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) can be expressed in terms of \( |e_1\rangle \) and \( |e_3\rangle \):
\[
|v\rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} |e_1\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |e_3\rangle.
\]
The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |e_3\rangle \) in \( |v\rangle \):
\[
P(Q=-1) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:
\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

Wait, but when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, when you measure Q on this new state, you get the probability of -1.

Alternatively, maybe the measurements are done in the same state, but that's not what the question says. Wait, no, the question says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." So the process is: measure P, which gives 0, then measure Q on the resulting state. So the probabilities are sequential.

So the total probability is the product of the probabilities at each step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P. Because when you measure P, you get an eigenvalue, and the state becomes the corresponding eigenvector.

Looking at operator P's matrix:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, let me write this matrix more clearly.

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I need to find the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I'll compute the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's set up the matrix (P - λ I):

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row.

The determinant would be:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Simplify each term.

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) ) ] → -(1/√2)( -λ/√2 ) = (λ)/(2)

Third term is 0.

So putting it all together:

det = -λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + λ/2

= -λ³ + λ

Set equal to zero: -λ³ + λ = 0 ⇒ λ( -λ² +1 ) =0 → λ (1 - λ²) =0 → λ =0, 1, -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but the problem is about measuring P and getting 0. So the state after measuring P=0 would be the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T, normalized by 1/sqrt(6). Let me denote this state as |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1)^T.

When we measure P, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues 0, 1, -1. The probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0 in the state |ψ>.

So first, I need to find the eigenvector for λ=0.

Let's solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0, so P|v> = 0.

The matrix P is:

[ 0      1/√2  0     ]
[ 1/√2  0     1/√2 ]
[ 0      1/√2 0     ]

So the equations are:

1) 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

2) (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

3) 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → same as equation 1, which gives v2=0.

So from these, v2=0. Then v1 = -v3. Let me set v3 = t, so v1 = -t. So the eigenvector is [-t, 0, t]^T, which can be written as t [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T. The eigenvector is along the direction (-1, 0, 1).

So the normalized eigenvector for λ=0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T.

Now, the initial state |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. The amplitude for the eigenvector corresponding to 0 is the inner product of |ψ> and |v>, where |v> is the eigenvector for 0.

So compute <v|ψ> = [ -1, 0, 1 ] (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) ) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)) ) * ( (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 )

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) ) * (1 + 0 +1 ) = (2)/(sqrt(12)) ) = (2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).

The probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the amplitude, which is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

So probability P=0 is 1/3.

Now, upon measuring P=0, the state collapses into the eigenstate |v> for λ=0, which is (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.

Now, we measure Q on this new state. The operator Q has the matrix:

Q = [
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The initial state after P measurement is |v> = (1/sqrt(2)) [-1, 0, 1]^T.

Wait, when you express |v> as a vector, it's (-1, 0, 1) scaled by 1/sqrt(2).

Now, the observable Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors for Q are the standard basis vectors because Q is diagonal.

Specifically:

- Eigenvalue 1: |e1> = (1,0,0)^T.
- Eigenvalue 0: |e2> = (0,1,0)^T.
- Eigenvalue -1: |e3> = (0,0,1)^T.

So the state |v> is in the subspace spanned by |e1> and |e3>, because the middle component is zero.

Express |v> in terms of the eigenstates of Q. Since |v> is ( -1/sqrt(2) , 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

So the components in |e1>, |e2>, |e3> are: (-1/sqrt(2)), 0, and (1/sqrt(2)).

So when we measure Q on |v>, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of Q, which are 1, 0, -1.

The probability of each outcome is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in |v>.

In this case, the amplitude for eigenvalue 1 is the coefficient of |e1>, which is (-1/sqrt(2)), so the probability is (1/2).

Similarly, for eigenvalue -1, the amplitude is 1/sqrt(2), so probability is (1/2).

Eigenvalue 0 has amplitude 0, so probability 0.

So when we measure Q after P=0, the probabilities are 1/2 for Q=1 and 1/2 for Q=-1.

But in the problem, we're interested in the outcome where Q is -1. So the probability is 1/2.

Wait a minute, but wait: the problem states that the measurement of Q is done just after the measurement of P. So the total probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and then Q=-1, given that P was 0.

Wait, no, it's the joint probability: the probability that P=0 and then Q=-1.

Which would be the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P was 0.

Wait, but in reality, the state after P=0 is known, and the Q measurement is done on that state. So the two probabilities are multiplicative.

So the total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

So looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

1. Initial state |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 )^T / sqrt(6).

2. Compute P's eigenvalues: 0, 1, -1.

3. For λ=0, eigenvector is proportional to (-1, 0, 1)^T.

4. The amplitude is <v|ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1)(-1) + 0*2 + 1*1 ] = (1/(sqrt(12))) )*(2) = 2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).

5. Probability of P=0 is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

6. After P=0, state is |v> = (-1, 0, 1)^T /sqrt(2).

7. Measure Q: Q's eigenstates are the standard basis. The state |v> is a combination of |e1> and |e3>.

8. The coefficient for |e3> (which gives Q=-1) is (1/sqrt(2)), so the probability is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

Multiply the two probabilities: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.


The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), on a quantum system. The system's initial state is given as \( | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and the operators \( P \) and \( Q \) are represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to compute the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The matrix for \( P \) is:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Solving for the eigenvalues of \( P \), we find \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the corresponding eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Normalizing it, the eigenvector becomes:
\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of \( P = 0 \)
The initial state \( | \psi \rangle \) is normalized as \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |v\rangle \) in \( | \psi \rangle \). The amplitude is:
\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( (-1)(-1) + 0(2) + 1(1) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(P=0) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses into the eigenstate \( |v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Measuring \( Q \)
The matrix for \( Q \) is:
\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with eigenvectors \( |e_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( |e_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( |e_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), respectively.

The state \( |v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \) can be expressed in terms of \( |e_1\rangle \) and \( |e_3\rangle \):
\[
|v\rangle = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} |e_1\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |e_3\rangle.
\]
The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |e_3\rangle \) in \( |v\rangle \):
\[
P(Q=-1) = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:
\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
