Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the IR data shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretching. Since the molecular formula includes an 'N', it's probably an amide or something similar. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Amides typically have a lower wavenumber for the carbonyl (like around 1650-1680), while esters are higher, around 1720-1740. So maybe it's an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely a methyl group attached to something that splits into a triplet. The integration is 3H, so probably a CH3 group next to a CH2. Like an ethyl group.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet with 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange, like NH groups, but the integration is 2H. Maybe an -OCH2- group? Or perhaps an ethylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, it could be an NH but getting a singlet suggests it's not split by neighboring Hs. Wait, but amines or amides have NH protons, but in some cases, they can be broad.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests it's next to a CH2, which is split into a triplet. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Possibly an ethoxy group, like -OCH2CH2-. Wait, but the quartet at 4.5 would fit with a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl ester. For example, in ethyl something, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1-4.3 or so, but wait, the quartet here is at 4.5. Hmm, maybe something else.

Wait, the ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3 as a quartet at about 4.1. So the quartet at 4.5 might not be that. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, like an amide. Wait, in amides, the NH protons are usually broad, but this is a quartet for 2H. Maybe it's an OCH2 group adjacent to another group. Let me think.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So perhaps a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) could indicate an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, nitro, or an amide group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is an ethyl ester of an aminobenzoic acid or something similar.

Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. Formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees: likely a benzene ring (3 rings + 3 double bonds?), wait benzene is 3 double bonds and a ring, so that would account for 4. The fifth could be a carbonyl group.

So, a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy in the 3 position. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. But the formula for 3-ethoxybenzamide would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: benzene (C6), ethoxy (OCH2CH3, which is C2H5O), and the amide group (CONH2). Wait, so C6 + (C2 from ethoxy) + (CONH2 is C1, O1, N1, H2). So total C:6+2+1=9, O: 1 (ethoxy) +1 (amide) +1 (from benzamide?) Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So benzamide is C7H7NO2 (benzene + CONH2: C=7, H=7, O=2, N=1). Then adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H12NO2. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So maybe something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's see: 4-aminobenzoic acid would be C7H7NO2. Then the ester would replace the -OH with OCH2CH3. So molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. That fits.

So option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's think about the NMR.

Ethyl ester: the ester group would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.2. But in the given NMR, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H. Hmm, maybe that's not the ethoxy. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is split into a triplet at 1.2 ppm (t,3H) and a quartet around 4.0 ppm. Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) fits the CH3 of an ethyl group. Then the quartet around 4.0 would be the OCH2.

Wait, the NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (2H) and 4.5 as a quartet (2H). Hmm. Wait, maybe that quartet is the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, in an ester, the carbonyl is adjacent to O. So perhaps the structure is something like O-CO-OCH2CH2-something? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, perhaps the 4.5 quartet is a methylene adjacent to the carbonyl, like a CH2 connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O

Benzoate ester: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) and an NH2 group.

Wait, but 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group and the ester in para positions. Wait, no, benzoate ester is the ester of benzoic acid. So the structure would be benzene ring with COOEt and NH2 in adjacent positions? No, because 4-aminobenzoate is benzene with COOEt in position 1 and NH2 in position 4.

Wait, benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. The ester would be C6H5COOEt. Now, if the amine is at position 4, then the structure is p-aminobenzoic acid esterified as p-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. So that's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

In such a case, the benzene ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. The 1 position is the COOEt, and 4 is NH2.

So the aromatic protons would be the two sets of doublets. The substituents are in para positions, so each pair of aromatic protons would be in meta positions relative to the substituents.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of two protons each, each in a doublet. So perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like COOEt) at one position, and an amino group (which is a strong activating group, but in this case, the amino is in the para position relative to COOEt.

Wait, but amino groups are para directing. So the ring would have COOEt and NH2 in para positions. The aromatic protons would then be in the ortho and meta positions to these substituents. But perhaps the deshielding would lead to the downfield shifts.

Alternatively, maybe the ring is substituted with a carbonyl group and an ethoxy group. Let me think about the options.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The NMR would show:

- The ethoxy group as a triplet and quartet. The 1.20 ppm triplet would be the CH3 of the ethoxy. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.2 ppm. But in our data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 from the ester, and the broad singlet at 4.0 is the NH2 group. But NH2 protons are usually broad and can appear as singlets, but I thought the integration is 2H. Wait, the broad singlet is 2H. So maybe it's an -NH- group or something else.

Wait, if the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 group is on the benzene ring. Then the protons on the amine would be broad and possibly as a singlet. But ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The triplet at 1.20 (3H) likely the OCH2CH3. The quartet for OCH2 would usually be around 4.1-4.2. But in the data, there's a quartet at 4.5 (2H). Hmm, maybe that's not the OCH2. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to something else.

Wait, another thought. Let's consider the IR. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester carbonyl. So an ester is present, which fits with option D as an ester.

The 1H NMR quartet at 4.5 could be the OCH2 from the ethoxy. But I thought that would be around 4.1. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl in an amide? No, because if it's an ester, that's OCH2CH3.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 in the para position.

The aromatic protons would be in two sets. For para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons. Let's say the substituents are at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). Then the H in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. The protons in 2 and 6 are adjacent to the NH2, which is a strong activating group, so they would be less deshielded than the protons in 3 and 5 which are adjacent to the COOEt group.

Wait, the substituents are in para positions, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets: ortho to COOEt and ortho to NH2. The protons ortho to COOEt would be more deshielded because the ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so their chemical shifts would be downfield. Conversely, the protons ortho to NH2 would be more shielded, appearing upfield.

Wait, so the protons ortho to the ester (COOEt) would be around 8.0 ppm, and those ortho to NH2 would be around 7.0 ppm. That matches the NMR data: two doublets, one at 7.0 (2H) and the other at 8.0 (2H). So that makes sense.

Then looking at the other NMR signals:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): the CH3 of the ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Could this be the NH2 group? But wait, the NH2 in a primary amine would usually show up as a broad peak, but integration is 2H. However, aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH protons that are usually broad singlets. Alternatively, perhaps it's an N-attached group. Wait, in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The protons on the NH2 would be broad, but since the ring is para to the ester, maybe the NH2 is not exchanging quickly, or maybe the solution is deprotonated? No, under normal conditions, the amino group in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be deprotonated in basic conditions, but the NMR was probably recorded in a neutral condition. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the broad singlet isn't the NH2 but something else.

Wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) might be the OCH2 from the ethoxy. But wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2. So the quartet at 4.5 doesn't fit. Maybe the quartet is from another group.

Another possibility: the compound is a formamide. Let me think about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.

In this case, the formamide would have a carbonyl group (IR at ~1720 cm-1, but wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1680, which doesn't match the IR data. Hmm, but the given IR has a strong band at 1720, which suggests an ester or maybe an amide. Wait, formamides have lower carbonyl frequencies. So maybe it's not formamide.

Wait, another thought. Let me calculate the molecular formulas for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H12NO3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Adding ethoxy in the 3 position would be C6H4(OCH2CH3)CONH2. So the formula would be C9H11NO3? Because C6 (benzene) + C2 (ethoxy) + C1 (amide) + N and O's. Wait, O's: ethoxy has O, amide has O and another O. So O count is 3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A's formula would be C9H11NO3, which doesn't fit. So A is out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR. So the structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3 (4-ethoxy). The formula would be C9H11NO3. Again, the given formula is C9H11NO2. So O count is 3 in option B, but the compound has O2. So B is out.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be the propionate ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is C6H4NH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Let me calculate the formula: benzene (C6), NH2 (N), COO (O2), propyl (C3H7). So total C:6+3+1 (from COO?) Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H5NH2COOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula is C10H13NO3. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So doesn't fit. So option C is out.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is C6H5COOEt with NH2 at the para position. So the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches.

So the correct answer is D.

Now, checking the NMR again. The ethyl group in the ester would have a triplet at ~1.2 (3H) and a quartet at ~4.1 (2H). But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, perhaps this is a different splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the ethyl group attached to oxygen as OCH2CH3. Quartet at 4.5. Wait, perhaps the shift is a bit downfield due to being next to something else. Or maybe the coupling is with more than one proton. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm broad singlet is 2H. Maybe it's the NH2 protons? But in a primary amine, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but integration is 2H. For a secondary amine, maybe, but in this case, it's a primary amine attached to benzene.

Another thought: the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could be an -NH- group, like in an amide. But in the structure of D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the amine is NH2.

Wait, perhaps the NMR is for an amide rather than an ester? Because I'm confused about the quartet and the singlet.

Wait, another option is formamide, which would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is from a CH2 connected to the carbonyl. So for an amide, like in option A or B. But earlier analysis suggests their molecular formulas don't fit.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the downfield shifts in the aromatic region. The two doublets suggest para substituents. So the substituents are in para positions, and the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So the substituents could be an electron-withdrawing group (like COOEt) and an electron-donating group (like NH2). The protons ortho to the COOEt would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those ortho to NH2.

In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is para to the COOEt. So the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). The H in position 2 and 6 are adjacent to NH2, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COOEt.

So the H in 2 and 6 (ortho to NH2) would be less deshielded (higher electron density) and appear upfield. The H in 3 and 5 (ortho to COOEt) would be more deshielded and appear downfield.

So in the NMR, the upfield doublet is 7.0 (2H), and the downfield is 8.0 (2H). That's consistent.

Now, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 of the ethoxy group. But in ethyl esters, the OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.2 as a quartet. So why is this at 4.5? Maybe in this structure, the ethoxy is adjacent to something else, causing a shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the CH2 next to the amide group, but that's not applicable here as it's an ester.

Another thought: maybe the quartet isn't from the ethoxy but from another part. Let me think about the structure. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to the amine. No, that doesn't fit with the structure.

Wait, in the NMR, there's a quartet at 4.5 (2H) and a broad singlet at 4.0 (2H). Maybe the quartet is the OCH2, but shifted upfield because of neighboring groups. Or perhaps the quartet is part of the amide group. But in this case, it's an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like in a propionate ester, but the formula doesn't match that.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the quartet at 4.5. Maybe I should think about the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3 (4-ethoxy). The IR would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, which for formamide would be a bit high. Wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1680, but maybe in this case, it's more deshielded, so higher. Not sure.

The NMR would have:

- The ethoxy group: triplet at 1.2 (3H) and quartet around 4.0 (2H).

- The formamide would have a CONH group. The NH would be a broad peak, maybe as a singlet. But the integration would be 1H, not 2H. But in the given data, there's a 2H singlet. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, the NH2 in option D would be two protons. But in the NMR, there's a quartet and a broad singlet. So perhaps the quartet is the ethoxy OCH2, and the broad singlet is the NH2.

Wait, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet. So in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which would fit the OCH2 in the ester. The triplet is at 1.20, so that's the CH3.

Then the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) must be something else. Wait, 2H broad. Maybe it's an NH2 group, but that's on the benzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2CH2 group, but I don't see that in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is the NH group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from the NH group in an amide. But in option D, it's an ester. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the 1H NMR of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester group's OCH2CH3 would give a quartet at ~4.1 and a triplet at ~1.2, which matches the data given. The aromatic region matches as well.

The other signals: the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 protons. But in D, the NH2 is on the ring. NH2 protons in aromatic amines are usually broad and can appear as a singlet. The integration is 2H, which fits an NH2 group. But why would they be a singlet? Because the two protons are equivalent and not split by any neighboring Hs. So a broad singlet at around 4.0 ppm.

Wait, but in reality, aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH2 protons that are typically broad and downfield, but in the case of p-aminobenzoate, perhaps the NH2 is more acidic because of the adjacent ester group, making the protons exchange quickly and appear as a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would correspond to the NH2 group.

That makes sense. So putting it all together, the data fits option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the IR data shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretching. Since the molecular formula includes an 'N', it's probably an amide or something similar. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Amides typically have a lower wavenumber for the carbonyl (like around 1650-1680), while esters are higher, around 1720-1740. So maybe it's an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely a methyl group attached to something that splits into a triplet. The integration is 3H, so probably a CH3 group next to a CH2. Like an ethyl group.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet with 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange, like NH groups, but the integration is 2H. Maybe an -OCH2- group? Or perhaps an ethylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Alternatively, it could be an NH but getting a singlet suggests it's not split by neighboring Hs. Wait, but amines or amides have NH protons, but in some cases, they can be broad.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests it's next to a CH2, which is split into a triplet. So maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Possibly an ethoxy group, like -OCH2CH2-. Wait, but the quartet at 4.5 would fit with a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl ester. For example, in ethyl something, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1-4.3 or so, but wait, the quartet here is at 4.5. Hmm, maybe something else.

Wait, the ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3 as a quartet at about 4.1. So the quartet at 4.5 might not be that. Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative group, like an amide. Wait, in amides, the NH protons are usually broad, but this is a quartet for 2H. Maybe it's an OCH2 group adjacent to another group. Let me think.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So perhaps a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The downfield shift (8.0 ppm) could indicate an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, nitro, or an amide group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is an ethyl ester of an aminobenzoic acid or something similar.

Wait, molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. Formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees: likely a benzene ring (3 rings + 3 double bonds?), wait benzene is 3 double bonds and a ring, so that would account for 4. The fifth could be a carbonyl group.

So, a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy in the 3 position. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. But the formula for 3-ethoxybenzamide would be C9H11NO2. Let me check: benzene (C6), ethoxy (OCH2CH3, which is C2H5O), and the amide group (CONH2). Wait, so C6 + (C2 from ethoxy) + (CONH2 is C1, O1, N1, H2). So total C:6+2+1=9, O: 1 (ethoxy) +1 (amide) +1 (from benzamide?) Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So benzamide is C7H7NO2 (benzene + CONH2: C=7, H=7, O=2, N=1). Then adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H12NO2. Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So maybe something else.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's see: 4-aminobenzoic acid would be C7H7NO2. Then the ester would replace the -OH with OCH2CH3. So molecular formula would be C9H11NO2. That fits.

So option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Let's think about the NMR.

Ethyl ester: the ester group would be OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at around 4.1-4.2. But in the given NMR, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm for 2H. Hmm, maybe that's not the ethoxy. Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is split into a triplet at 1.2 ppm (t,3H) and a quartet around 4.0 ppm. Wait, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) fits the CH3 of an ethyl group. Then the quartet around 4.0 would be the OCH2.

Wait, the NMR shows 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet (2H) and 4.5 as a quartet (2H). Hmm. Wait, maybe that quartet is the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, in an ester, the carbonyl is adjacent to O. So perhaps the structure is something like O-CO-OCH2CH2-something? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, perhaps the 4.5 quartet is a methylene adjacent to the carbonyl, like a CH2 connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is O

Benzoate ester: benzene ring with COOEt (ethyl ester) and an NH2 group.

Wait, but 4-aminobenzoate would have the amino group and the ester in para positions. Wait, no, benzoate ester is the ester of benzoic acid. So the structure would be benzene ring with COOEt and NH2 in adjacent positions? No, because 4-aminobenzoate is benzene with COOEt in position 1 and NH2 in position 4.

Wait, benzoic acid is C6H5COOH. The ester would be C6H5COOEt. Now, if the amine is at position 4, then the structure is p-aminobenzoic acid esterified as p-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. So that's ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

In such a case, the benzene ring would have substituents at positions 1 and 4. The 1 position is the COOEt, and 4 is NH2.

So the aromatic protons would be the two sets of doublets. The substituents are in para positions, so each pair of aromatic protons would be in meta positions relative to the substituents.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of two protons each, each in a doublet. So perhaps the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group (like COOEt) at one position, and an amino group (which is a strong activating group, but in this case, the amino is in the para position relative to COOEt.

Wait, but amino groups are para directing. So the ring would have COOEt and NH2 in para positions. The aromatic protons would then be in the ortho and meta positions to these substituents. But perhaps the deshielding would lead to the downfield shifts.

Alternatively, maybe the ring is substituted with a carbonyl group and an ethoxy group. Let me think about the options.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The NMR would show:

- The ethoxy group as a triplet and quartet. The 1.20 ppm triplet would be the CH3 of the ethoxy. The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.2 ppm. But in our data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 from the ester, and the broad singlet at 4.0 is the NH2 group. But NH2 protons are usually broad and can appear as singlets, but I thought the integration is 2H. Wait, the broad singlet is 2H. So maybe it's an -NH- group or something else.

Wait, if the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 group is on the benzene ring. Then the protons on the amine would be broad and possibly as a singlet. But ethyl ester would have the OCH2CH3. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The triplet at 1.20 (3H) likely the OCH2CH3. The quartet for OCH2 would usually be around 4.1-4.2. But in the data, there's a quartet at 4.5 (2H). Hmm, maybe that's not the OCH2. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to something else.

Wait, another thought. Let's consider the IR. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester carbonyl. So an ester is present, which fits with option D as an ester.

The 1H NMR quartet at 4.5 could be the OCH2 from the ethoxy. But I thought that would be around 4.1. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl in an amide? No, because if it's an ester, that's OCH2CH3.

Wait, let me think about the NMR of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2CH3 attached to benzene, and NH2 in the para position.

The aromatic protons would be in two sets. For para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons. Let's say the substituents are at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). Then the H in positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent. The protons in 2 and 6 are adjacent to the NH2, which is a strong activating group, so they would be less deshielded than the protons in 3 and 5 which are adjacent to the COOEt group.

Wait, the substituents are in para positions, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets: ortho to COOEt and ortho to NH2. The protons ortho to COOEt would be more deshielded because the ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so their chemical shifts would be downfield. Conversely, the protons ortho to NH2 would be more shielded, appearing upfield.

Wait, so the protons ortho to the ester (COOEt) would be around 8.0 ppm, and those ortho to NH2 would be around 7.0 ppm. That matches the NMR data: two doublets, one at 7.0 (2H) and the other at 8.0 (2H). So that makes sense.

Then looking at the other NMR signals:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): the CH3 of the ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Could this be the NH2 group? But wait, the NH2 in a primary amine would usually show up as a broad peak, but integration is 2H. However, aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH protons that are usually broad singlets. Alternatively, perhaps it's an N-attached group. Wait, in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The protons on the NH2 would be broad, but since the ring is para to the ester, maybe the NH2 is not exchanging quickly, or maybe the solution is deprotonated? No, under normal conditions, the amino group in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate would be deprotonated in basic conditions, but the NMR was probably recorded in a neutral condition. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the broad singlet isn't the NH2 but something else.

Wait, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) might be the OCH2 from the ethoxy. But wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1, and the CH3 as a triplet around 1.2. So the quartet at 4.5 doesn't fit. Maybe the quartet is from another group.

Another possibility: the compound is a formamide. Let me think about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.

In this case, the formamide would have a carbonyl group (IR at ~1720 cm-1, but wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1680, which doesn't match the IR data. Hmm, but the given IR has a strong band at 1720, which suggests an ester or maybe an amide. Wait, formamides have lower carbonyl frequencies. So maybe it's not formamide.

Wait, another thought. Let me calculate the molecular formulas for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make C9H12NO3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Adding ethoxy in the 3 position would be C6H4(OCH2CH3)CONH2. So the formula would be C9H11NO3? Because C6 (benzene) + C2 (ethoxy) + C1 (amide) + N and O's. Wait, O's: ethoxy has O, amide has O and another O. So O count is 3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A's formula would be C9H11NO3, which doesn't fit. So A is out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONHR. So the structure is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3 (4-ethoxy). The formula would be C9H11NO3. Again, the given formula is C9H11NO2. So O count is 3 in option B, but the compound has O2. So B is out.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be the propionate ester of 4-aminobenzoic acid. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is C6H4NH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Let me calculate the formula: benzene (C6), NH2 (N), COO (O2), propyl (C3H7). So total C:6+3+1 (from COO?) Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C6H5NH2COOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula is C10H13NO3. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So doesn't fit. So option C is out.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is C6H5COOEt with NH2 at the para position. So the formula is C9H11NO2, which matches.

So the correct answer is D.

Now, checking the NMR again. The ethyl group in the ester would have a triplet at ~1.2 (3H) and a quartet at ~4.1 (2H). But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, perhaps this is a different splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 ppm is the ethyl group attached to oxygen as OCH2CH3. Quartet at 4.5. Wait, perhaps the shift is a bit downfield due to being next to something else. Or maybe the coupling is with more than one proton. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from another group.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm broad singlet is 2H. Maybe it's the NH2 protons? But in a primary amine, the NH2 would be a broad peak, but integration is 2H. For a secondary amine, maybe, but in this case, it's a primary amine attached to benzene.

Another thought: the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm could be an -NH- group, like in an amide. But in the structure of D (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), the amine is NH2.

Wait, perhaps the NMR is for an amide rather than an ester? Because I'm confused about the quartet and the singlet.

Wait, another option is formamide, which would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 ppm quartet is from a CH2 connected to the carbonyl. So for an amide, like in option A or B. But earlier analysis suggests their molecular formulas don't fit.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the downfield shifts in the aromatic region. The two doublets suggest para substituents. So the substituents are in para positions, and the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. So the substituents could be an electron-withdrawing group (like COOEt) and an electron-donating group (like NH2). The protons ortho to the COOEt would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than those ortho to NH2.

In ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is para to the COOEt. So the ring has substituents at positions 1 (COOEt) and 4 (NH2). The H in position 2 and 6 are adjacent to NH2, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to COOEt.

So the H in 2 and 6 (ortho to NH2) would be less deshielded (higher electron density) and appear upfield. The H in 3 and 5 (ortho to COOEt) would be more deshielded and appear downfield.

So in the NMR, the upfield doublet is 7.0 (2H), and the downfield is 8.0 (2H). That's consistent.

Now, the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) would be the OCH2 of the ethoxy group. But in ethyl esters, the OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.2 as a quartet. So why is this at 4.5? Maybe in this structure, the ethoxy is adjacent to something else, causing a shift.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from the CH2 next to the amide group, but that's not applicable here as it's an ester.

Another thought: maybe the quartet isn't from the ethoxy but from another part. Let me think about the structure. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to the amine. No, that doesn't fit with the structure.

Wait, in the NMR, there's a quartet at 4.5 (2H) and a broad singlet at 4.0 (2H). Maybe the quartet is the OCH2, but shifted upfield because of neighboring groups. Or perhaps the quartet is part of the amide group. But in this case, it's an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like in a propionate ester, but the formula doesn't match that.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the quartet at 4.5. Maybe I should think about the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3 (4-ethoxy). The IR would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1, which for formamide would be a bit high. Wait, formamide's carbonyl is around 1680, but maybe in this case, it's more deshielded, so higher. Not sure.

The NMR would have:

- The ethoxy group: triplet at 1.2 (3H) and quartet around 4.0 (2H).

- The formamide would have a CONH group. The NH would be a broad peak, maybe as a singlet. But the integration would be 1H, not 2H. But in the given data, there's a 2H singlet. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, the NH2 in option D would be two protons. But in the NMR, there's a quartet and a broad singlet. So perhaps the quartet is the ethoxy OCH2, and the broad singlet is the NH2.

Wait, the ethoxy group's OCH2 would be a quartet. So in the data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which would fit the OCH2 in the ester. The triplet is at 1.20, so that's the CH3.

Then the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) must be something else. Wait, 2H broad. Maybe it's an NH2 group, but that's on the benzene. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2CH2 group, but I don't see that in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is the NH group? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the quartet is from the NH group in an amide. But in option D, it's an ester. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the 1H NMR of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The ester group's OCH2CH3 would give a quartet at ~4.1 and a triplet at ~1.2, which matches the data given. The aromatic region matches as well.

The other signals: the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 protons. But in D, the NH2 is on the ring. NH2 protons in aromatic amines are usually broad and can appear as a singlet. The integration is 2H, which fits an NH2 group. But why would they be a singlet? Because the two protons are equivalent and not split by any neighboring Hs. So a broad singlet at around 4.0 ppm.

Wait, but in reality, aromatic amines (like aniline) have NH2 protons that are typically broad and downfield, but in the case of p-aminobenzoate, perhaps the NH2 is more acidic because of the adjacent ester group, making the protons exchange quickly and appear as a broad peak. So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) would correspond to the NH2 group.

That makes sense. So putting it all together, the data fits option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


The compound to identify is C9H11NO2, and the spectroscopic data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Here's the analysis:

### IR Analysis:
- **Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are indicative of N-H stretching, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group.
- **Strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This is characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, likely corresponding to the CH3 group of an ethyl group (OCH2CH3).
2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to the NH2 group of an aromatic amine.
3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to the OCH2 group of an ethoxy group.
4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets each integrating to 2H, consistent with a para-substituted aromatic ring. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm suggests an electron-withdrawing group, such as a carbonyl, while the upfield shift at 7.0 ppm suggests an electron-donating group, such as an amino group.
