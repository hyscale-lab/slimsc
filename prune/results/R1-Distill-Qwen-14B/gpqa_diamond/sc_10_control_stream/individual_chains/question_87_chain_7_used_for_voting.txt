Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Also, the FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so I need to figure out the structure based on this information and then match it to the NMR options.

First, let's break down the given information. The compound is a six-membered aromatic ring, which is di-substituted. So there are two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, the benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons total. But wait, substituents can be more complex. Wait, no: if the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2, then the total is 8. But substituents are groups attached to the ring. So each substituent could have more than one carbon. Let me think.

Wait, the substituents are likely in positions that make the molecule di-substituted. The IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, maybe, or an aldehyde, or an ester. The other substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, I. Or wait, could the substituent itself be something else, like a nitro group? No, because the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituent must have a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait: the carbonyl group could be an ester, a ketone, an aldehyde, etc. Let me think about the possible structures.

So, the ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, the other is a halogen. Or wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is a halogen. Or perhaps, the substituent is a group that has both a carbonyl and a halogen? Let me consider.

Wait, but the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen. So the molecule must have both a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So, the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Wait, but wait: the substituent could be a group like a nitro group? No, because the IR doesn't mention that. So it's either -X (like -Cl, -Br) or a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the substituents are on the benzene ring, so they can be either. So for the di-substituted ring, each substituent is either a carbonyl group or a halogen. But wait, a carbonyl group itself is a substituent. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group (like -CO-R) and the other is a halogen. Wait, but that might add more carbons.

Wait, the total number of carbons is 8. The benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2. So each substituent must be a single carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl and the other is halogen, but that doesn't add any carbons.

Wait, maybe it's a structure where one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is a halogen attached to the ring. Let's see.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. For example, perhaps the ring has a -COOR group and a -X (like Cl) substituent. But wait, the -COOR group would have more than one carbon. For example, a methoxycarbonyl group would be O-CO-OCH3, but that's probably too much.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. So, for example, a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone, so -CO-) and a halogen (like Cl). Wait, but that would require that the substituents are -CO- and -X. But a carbonyl group as a substituent would have to be attached via a carbon, perhaps as an acyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Like a benzaldehyde with a halogen substituent. So the ring has a -CHO group (which is a carbonyl) and a -X group.

But then the substituents are -CHO and -X. The ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Then, the total number of carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (X, but X is a halogen, which doesn't add a carbon) = 8. Oh wait, the CHO is attached via a carbon, so maybe that's correct.

So, the structure would be something like a benzaldehyde with another substituent, say, a chlorine. So, for example, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde. So, the substituents are on adjacent positions (ortho), or other positions. But the exact positions may not matter for the NMR, but the splitting patterns might.

Wait, but looking at the options, the NMR data will give clues about the structure, like the presence of aromatic protons, any protons near the carbonyl, or adjacent to the halogen, etc.

Now, let's look at the options for the NMR.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So, the 9.9 ppm is a singlet, which is probably an aldehyde proton. Then, the doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 suggest some coupling between the aromatic protons. The 3.7 ppm is two protons as a singlet, perhaps a methylene group, maybe OCH2O or something like that. Or CH2O.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These shifts are more typical for something like an ether or an acetal. The 4.8 and 4.6 could be adjacent CH2 groups, perhaps with an oxygen, like CH2-O-CH2. The 1.3 is a singlet for a CH3 group. But this doesn't have any aromatic protons, which is a problem because the compound is an aromatic ring. So this option seems unlikely because it doesn't show any aromatic signals.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 suggest coupling between aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted pattern. The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. So maybe a toluene derivative with a carbonyl. If the structure is something like para-methylbenzaldehyde, but wait, no, because that would have an aldehyde proton too. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Like acetophenone. But acetophenone has an aromatic ring with a ketone substituent. But in that case, the NMR would show the ketone's methyl group as a singlet around 2.6 ppm, perhaps, but this is at 2.3. Hmm, but let me think.

Wait, the structure in this option has aromatic protons as two doublets. That suggests perhaps a para-substituted ring, where each pair of protons is a doublet due to coupling with the other pair. So, for example, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no: if substituents are in the para positions, maybe the aromatic protons are deshielded, but each pair would be a doublet. Alternatively, if it's a meta-substitution, but that's less likely.

Wait, in acetophenone, the aromatic protons are typically a multiplet because they're next to substituents. Or maybe if the substituents cause the ring to have symmetry. Hmm, perhaps.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 is a singlet, possibly an aromatic proton. The other signals are similar to option B, perhaps a di-substituted group. But this also lacks aromatic signals except for that one proton, which is confusing because the ring should have substituents leading to more aromatic protons.

Wait, but perhaps the ring has substituents that cause certain aromatic protons to be equivalent, leading to a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene with substituents that make some protons equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Now, thinking back to the molecule. It has a carbonyl group and a halogen on the ring. So perhaps the substituents are -CO-R and -X.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. So let's consider structures.

If the ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group, say a ketone (R-CO-R), but that would add more carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a -COOR group, like an ester. For example, something like phenyl acetate: the ring has a -OAc (acetoxy) group, but that's an O-linked group.

Wait, but let's think about the carbons. The benzene ring (6C) + substituents. Let's say one substituent is a -Cl (no carbons), and the other is a -CO-CH3 (so that's 2 more carbons, making 6+2=8). So that would fit: the substituents are a carbonyl (COCH3) and Cl.

So, the structure would be, for example, 3-chlorobenzaldehyde if the substituents are CHO and Cl. Or, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, etc. Wait, but wait: benzaldehyde itself has a CHO group as a substituent. So if the ring has a Cl and a CHO, that would make two substituents. Let's say the substituents are para to each other.

But wait, in that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions that are ortho, meta, or para. Let's imagine the substituents are para. So the ring would have Cl and CHO in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to each substituent. Depending on their positions, their chemical shifts and coupling patterns would vary.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a ketone, like a -COCH3 group, then the ring would have that and a Cl. So, for example, 4-chloroacetophenone.

So, the structure would be benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group in para positions.

Now, the NMR of such a compound would have signals for the aromatic protons, the COCH3 methyl group, and perhaps any other groups.

Let me think about the aromatic region. In para-substituted benzene rings with two strong electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl and COCH3), the aromatic protons would be deshielded and perhaps split into specific patterns.

But wait, when there are two substituents, the coupling between the protons can result in a certain splitting. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the remaining protons are in the ortho positions relative to each substituent. So, for a para-disubstituted benzene, the aromatic protons would typically be two doublets, each integrating for two protons each. Alternatively, perhaps they are all as a singlet, but that's less common.

Wait, in the case where substituents are at the para positions, the remaining four aromatic positions are symmetric. They would be in two pairs of equivalent positions. So, the protons in the ortho positions to each substituent would be equivalent, and the protons in the meta positions (relative to substituents) would be another set of equivalent protons. Wait, maybe not. Let me sketch this out.

If the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 on benzene (I think that's meta for di-substituted), then the ring would have certain symmetry. Alternatively, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para), then the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta) or 1 and 2 (ortho), but I'm getting a bit stuck on that.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzophenone derivative, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are -CHO and -Cl, making the aromatic protons in the ortho and para positions to each group.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR signals.

If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic ring would have symmetry. So, the two substituents are across from each other. The remaining protons would be in symmetric positions, so for example, the two protons adjacent to the Cl would be equivalent, and the two adjacent to the COCH3 would be another set. But perhaps the coupling would lead to a pattern where each pair is a doublet.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a situation where two pairs of protons each are coupled, perhaps in a para-substituted ring.

So, option A: 9.9 (1H, s), which is likely the aldehyde proton. Then, the two doublets in the aromatic region. So, that would fit a structure with a para-substituted benzaldehyde and another substituent, say Cl.

Wait, but let me think about the substituents. If the substituents are in the para positions, the aldehyde would be in position 1, and Cl in position 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Let's see how that would appear in the NMR.

The protons ortho to the aldehyde (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and possibly as a doublet due to coupling with each other and maybe the meta protons. Similarly, the protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be another set. But would they couple with each other?

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzaldehyde with a Cl, the ring would have four aromatic protons. Let's say positions 2,3,5,6.

Assuming that the aldehyde is in position 1, Cl in position 4.

Then, position 2 and 6 are each adjacent to the aldehyde, so they are ortho to CHO. Positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl, so ortho to Cl.

In this case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent due to the symmetry of the para substitution. Similarly, 3 and 5 would be equivalent.

Each of these sets could show as a doublet if they are coupled with each other. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 would each couple with the protons at 3 and 5, leading to a doublet for each. But wait, that's a more complex coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between adjacent protons. So, the protons at 2 and 3 would be adjacent, leading to coupling between them.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the NMR pattern in option A: 9.9 (1H, s) – likely the aldehyde proton. Then, 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So, the aldehyde is at 9.9, and the other protons are in two doublets.

So, in the aromatic region, the four protons are split into two groups: two as a doublet at 7.8, and another two as a doublet at 7.6. That suggests that the two sets are each coupling with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted ring, but that's less likely to give two doublets.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are in the para positions, and the aromatic protons are split into two doublets due to coupling between the two sets. Let me imagine that the protons ortho to the substituents are each a doublet because they're coupling with the adjacent protons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the substituents are both in the para positions, and the aromatic protons are in two sets of doublets.

Now, in the IR, the presence of a carbonyl group suggests a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, which is typical for aldehydes, ketones, esters, etc. The presence of an aromatic-halogen bond would show up as a C-X stretch, perhaps around 500-800 cm^-1, depending on the halogen.

So, the structure is likely a para-substituted benzaldehyde with a halogen, like Cl.

Now, looking at the NMR options again.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is a good match for an aldehyde proton. The two doublets suggest the aromatic protons are split into two sets of two, each as a doublet. That could happen if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, leading to four aromatic protons, split into two groups, each with two protons.

In such a case, each set of two protons would be adjacent to each substituent, and the coupling would cause them to split into doublets.

So, the aromatic signals would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The aldehyde proton is a singlet because it's not coupled to any other protons (since it's on the end of the chain). But wait, in a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to the aromatic ring. So, the aldehyde proton would have coupling with the adjacent aromatic protons, leading to splitting. But in the case where the substituents are para, the adjacent aromatic protons would be equivalent, leading to a singlet? Hmm, no, because the aldehyde proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons, which would cause a doublet.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again: in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the aldehyde is at position 1, and the Cl is at position 4. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the aldehyde, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to the Cl.

So, the aldehyde proton (position 1) is next to positions 2 and 6. So, the aldehyde proton would couple with protons 2 and 6. But in a para-substituted structure, protons 2 and 6 are equivalent. So, the aldehyde proton would be split into a doublet, but in the NMR, option A shows a singlet. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about ortho coupling. The aldehyde proton (position 1) is adjacent to proton 2 and 6. So, each of those protons would be ortho to the aldehyde. But if both are equivalent, the coupling would be as if the aldehyde proton is coupled to two equivalent protons, leading to a triplet. Wait, but that's not the case here. In option A, the aldehyde proton is a singlet. So maybe that's not the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't an aldehyde. Maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, if the substituent is a ketone group, like -COCH3, then the aldehyde proton wouldn't be present. So, let's think about that.

If the substituents are -COCH3 (in position 1) and Cl (in position 4), the ring would have a ketone and a Cl in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Let's consider their NMR signals.

The protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to the ketone (COCH3), so they would be ortho to that group. The protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to the Cl, so ortho to Cl.

In such a structure, the protons at 2 and 6 would be deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the ketone. The protons at 3 and 5 would be deshielded due to the Cl.

The coupling between these protons would lead to specific splitting patterns.

But without the aldehyde, the NMR wouldn't have a peak around 9.9 ppm. So, looking back at the options, option C has a peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which could be the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (like COCH3). Let's look at option C.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So, the 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H – likely a COCH3 group. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. So, that fits with the para-substituted structure where the ring has a COCH3 and a Cl in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two sets: the two ortho to COCH3 (positions 2 and 6) and the two ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Each of these would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent protons.

Wait, but in that structure, positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to each other. So, their coupling would cause each other to split. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent, causing each to be a doublet.

But how would this appear in the NMR? Let me try to imagine:

Protons 2 and 6 are each next to protons 3 and 1 (the ketone). Wait, no, position 1 is the COCH3, position 4 is Cl.

So, proton 2 is adjacent to position 1 (COCH3) and 3. Proton 3 is adjacent to 2, 4 (Cl), and 6. Hmm, perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic ring would have symmetry, so that the protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent, and the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) are equivalent.

In that case, the coupling between protons 2 and 3 would cause each to split into a doublet. So, the protons at 2 and 6 would each be coupled to the protons at 3 and 5, which are equivalent. So, each set (2 and 6, 3 and 5) would appear as a doublet.

This would match option C, where the aromatic signals are two doublets, each 2H, and a singlet for the COCH3 methyl group.

So, option C's NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the COCH3. That would fit with a para-substituted benzene ring with a ketone and a Cl.

But wait, the IR also shows a carbonyl group. A ketone would have a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits.

So, the structure is 4-chloroacetophenone.

Now, let's check the other options to see if they fit.

Option A suggests an aldehyde (9.9 ppm), but that would require the substituent to be a CHO group, which adds one carbon. But earlier analysis suggests that the substituents are a Cl and a COCH3 group, which adds two carbons, making the total 8. So option A's structure would have a CHO group and a Cl, which would add two substituents but only one carbon (CHO is one carbon). So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) = 7, which doesn't match the 8 carbons given. So option A is incorrect.

Wait, wait, no. The substituent would be a CHO group (which is one carbon) and another substituent which adds one carbon, perhaps. For example, if one substituent is CHO (1C) and another is a CH2Cl group (but that would add more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a COX group that adds the necessary carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a COOR group, which would add more carbons. For example, if R is CH3, then the substituent adds two carbons (O-CO-OCH3?) No, COOR would be O-CO-R, so if R is CH3, it's O-CO-OCH3, which is three carbons? Wait, no, R is CH3, so the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which adds two carbons (O is not a carbon). So, substituent would be O-CO-CH3, which adds two carbons.

So, in that case, the ring would have a O-CO-CH3 group and a Cl group. So, that would be a total of 6 (ring) + 2 (COOCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8 carbons.

In that case, the structure would be, say, 4-chlorobenzophenone, but wait, no, because benzophenone is a diaryl ketone. Alternatively, 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride? No, that's different.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, O-CO-OCH3, which would add more carbons. But that would add three carbons (the O's don't count, so COOCH3 is three carbons). So the ring would have 6 +3 =9 carbons, which doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that the substituents are COCH3 and Cl, adding two carbons, making 8 total. So, this would fit with option C's NMR, which has a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, likely the COCH3 group.

So, going back, option C's NMR data would be correct for 4-chloroacetophenone, which has the carbonyl group (from the ketone) and the Cl in the para position.

Another option to check is option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). This seems to have only one aromatic proton, which suggests a highly substituted ring. But our structure has four aromatic protons, so this option is unlikely.

Option B: no aromatic protons, which can't be right because the compound is aromatic.

So, option C seems to fit.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. The total number of carbons (8) implies that the benzene ring (6 carbons) has two substituents adding 2 carbons in total. 

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks at 9.9 ppm (1H, s) suggest an aldehyde proton.  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets.  
   - Peak at 3.7 ppm (2H, s) suggests a methylene group.  
   - However, the total number of carbons in this structure would be 7 (6 from the benzene ring, 1 from the aldehyde, and 1 from the methylene group), which does not match the given total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), and 1.3 ppm (3H, s) suggest a structure with ether or acetal groups.  
   - There are no aromatic signals, which is inconsistent with the compound being an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets.  
   - Peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) suggests a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (e.g., COCH₃).  
   - This structure fits a para-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (e.g., COCH₃) and a halogen (e.g., Cl) in the para positions. The total number of carbons is 8 (6 from the benzene ring, 2 from the COCH₃ group), which matches the given data. This option is consistent with the compound.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peak at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests a single aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with the compound being di-substituted.  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), and 1.3 ppm (2H, s) suggest a structure with ether or acetal groups, but there are no aromatic signals besides the single proton. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (e.g., COCH₃) and a halogen (e.g., Cl) in the para positions. The NMR data in **Option C** matches this structure, with two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. 

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Also, the FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, so I need to figure out the structure based on this information and then match it to the NMR options.

First, let's break down the given information. The compound is a six-membered aromatic ring, which is di-substituted. So there are two substituents on the ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Wait, the benzene ring has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons total. But wait, substituents can be more complex. Wait, no: if the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add 2, then the total is 8. But substituents are groups attached to the ring. So each substituent could have more than one carbon. Let me think.

Wait, the substituents are likely in positions that make the molecule di-substituted. The IR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, maybe, or an aldehyde, or an ester. The other substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, I. Or wait, could the substituent itself be something else, like a nitro group? No, because the IR shows an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituent must have a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait: the carbonyl group could be an ester, a ketone, an aldehyde, etc. Let me think about the possible structures.

So, the ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl-containing group, the other is a halogen. Or wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is a halogen. Or perhaps, the substituent is a group that has both a carbonyl and a halogen? Let me consider.

Wait, but the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen. So the molecule must have both a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

So, the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Wait, but wait: the substituent could be a group like a nitro group? No, because the IR doesn't mention that. So it's either -X (like -Cl, -Br) or a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the substituents are on the benzene ring, so they can be either. So for the di-substituted ring, each substituent is either a carbonyl group or a halogen. But wait, a carbonyl group itself is a substituent. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group (like -CO-R) and the other is a halogen. Wait, but that might add more carbons.

Wait, the total number of carbons is 8. The benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2. So each substituent must be a single carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl and the other is halogen, but that doesn't add any carbons.

Wait, maybe it's a structure where one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the ring, and the other substituent is a halogen attached to the ring. Let's see.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. For example, perhaps the ring has a -COOR group and a -X (like Cl) substituent. But wait, the -COOR group would have more than one carbon. For example, a methoxycarbonyl group would be O-CO-OCH3, but that's probably too much.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen. So, for example, a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone, so -CO-) and a halogen (like Cl). Wait, but that would require that the substituents are -CO- and -X. But a carbonyl group as a substituent would have to be attached via a carbon, perhaps as an acyl group.

Wait, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Like a benzaldehyde with a halogen substituent. So the ring has a -CHO group (which is a carbonyl) and a -X group.

But then the substituents are -CHO and -X. The ring is di-substituted, so two substituents. Then, the total number of carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 1 (X, but X is a halogen, which doesn't add a carbon) = 8. Oh wait, the CHO is attached via a carbon, so maybe that's correct.

So, the structure would be something like a benzaldehyde with another substituent, say, a chlorine. So, for example, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde. So, the substituents are on adjacent positions (ortho), or other positions. But the exact positions may not matter for the NMR, but the splitting patterns might.

Wait, but looking at the options, the NMR data will give clues about the structure, like the presence of aromatic protons, any protons near the carbonyl, or adjacent to the halogen, etc.

Now, let's look at the options for the NMR.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So, the 9.9 ppm is a singlet, which is probably an aldehyde proton. Then, the doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 suggest some coupling between the aromatic protons. The 3.7 ppm is two protons as a singlet, perhaps a methylene group, maybe OCH2O or something like that. Or CH2O.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These shifts are more typical for something like an ether or an acetal. The 4.8 and 4.6 could be adjacent CH2 groups, perhaps with an oxygen, like CH2-O-CH2. The 1.3 is a singlet for a CH3 group. But this doesn't have any aromatic protons, which is a problem because the compound is an aromatic ring. So this option seems unlikely because it doesn't show any aromatic signals.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 suggest coupling between aromatic protons, perhaps in a para-substituted pattern. The 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H suggests a methyl group attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. So maybe a toluene derivative with a carbonyl. If the structure is something like para-methylbenzaldehyde, but wait, no, because that would have an aldehyde proton too. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Like acetophenone. But acetophenone has an aromatic ring with a ketone substituent. But in that case, the NMR would show the ketone's methyl group as a singlet around 2.6 ppm, perhaps, but this is at 2.3. Hmm, but let me think.

Wait, the structure in this option has aromatic protons as two doublets. That suggests perhaps a para-substituted ring, where each pair of protons is a doublet due to coupling with the other pair. So, for example, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no: if substituents are in the para positions, maybe the aromatic protons are deshielded, but each pair would be a doublet. Alternatively, if it's a meta-substitution, but that's less likely.

Wait, in acetophenone, the aromatic protons are typically a multiplet because they're next to substituents. Or maybe if the substituents cause the ring to have symmetry. Hmm, perhaps.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 is a singlet, possibly an aromatic proton. The other signals are similar to option B, perhaps a di-substituted group. But this also lacks aromatic signals except for that one proton, which is confusing because the ring should have substituents leading to more aromatic protons.

Wait, but perhaps the ring has substituents that cause certain aromatic protons to be equivalent, leading to a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted benzene with substituents that make some protons equivalent, but I'm not sure.

Now, thinking back to the molecule. It has a carbonyl group and a halogen on the ring. So perhaps the substituents are -CO-R and -X.

Wait, but the total carbons are 8. So let's consider structures.

If the ring has a substituent that's a carbonyl group, say a ketone (R-CO-R), but that would add more carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a -COOR group, like an ester. For example, something like phenyl acetate: the ring has a -OAc (acetoxy) group, but that's an O-linked group.

Wait, but let's think about the carbons. The benzene ring (6C) + substituents. Let's say one substituent is a -Cl (no carbons), and the other is a -CO-CH3 (so that's 2 more carbons, making 6+2=8). So that would fit: the substituents are a carbonyl (COCH3) and Cl.

So, the structure would be, for example, 3-chlorobenzaldehyde if the substituents are CHO and Cl. Or, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, etc. Wait, but wait: benzaldehyde itself has a CHO group as a substituent. So if the ring has a Cl and a CHO, that would make two substituents. Let's say the substituents are para to each other.

But wait, in that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions that are ortho, meta, or para. Let's imagine the substituents are para. So the ring would have Cl and CHO in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and meta positions relative to each substituent. Depending on their positions, their chemical shifts and coupling patterns would vary.

Alternatively, if the substituent is a ketone, like a -COCH3 group, then the ring would have that and a Cl. So, for example, 4-chloroacetophenone.

So, the structure would be benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group in para positions.

Now, the NMR of such a compound would have signals for the aromatic protons, the COCH3 methyl group, and perhaps any other groups.

Let me think about the aromatic region. In para-substituted benzene rings with two strong electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl and COCH3), the aromatic protons would be deshielded and perhaps split into specific patterns.

But wait, when there are two substituents, the coupling between the protons can result in a certain splitting. For example, in para-substituted benzene, the remaining protons are in the ortho positions relative to each substituent. So, for a para-disubstituted benzene, the aromatic protons would typically be two doublets, each integrating for two protons each. Alternatively, perhaps they are all as a singlet, but that's less common.

Wait, in the case where substituents are at the para positions, the remaining four aromatic positions are symmetric. They would be in two pairs of equivalent positions. So, the protons in the ortho positions to each substituent would be equivalent, and the protons in the meta positions (relative to substituents) would be another set of equivalent protons. Wait, maybe not. Let me sketch this out.

If the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 on benzene (I think that's meta for di-substituted), then the ring would have certain symmetry. Alternatively, if substituents are at positions 1 and 4 (para), then the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 3 (meta) or 1 and 2 (ortho), but I'm getting a bit stuck on that.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzophenone derivative, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are -CHO and -Cl, making the aromatic protons in the ortho and para positions to each group.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR signals.

If the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic ring would have symmetry. So, the two substituents are across from each other. The remaining protons would be in symmetric positions, so for example, the two protons adjacent to the Cl would be equivalent, and the two adjacent to the COCH3 would be another set. But perhaps the coupling would lead to a pattern where each pair is a doublet.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has two doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a situation where two pairs of protons each are coupled, perhaps in a para-substituted ring.

So, option A: 9.9 (1H, s), which is likely the aldehyde proton. Then, the two doublets in the aromatic region. So, that would fit a structure with a para-substituted benzaldehyde and another substituent, say Cl.

Wait, but let me think about the substituents. If the substituents are in the para positions, the aldehyde would be in position 1, and Cl in position 4.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Let's see how that would appear in the NMR.

The protons ortho to the aldehyde (positions 2 and 6) would be deshielded and possibly as a doublet due to coupling with each other and maybe the meta protons. Similarly, the protons ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be another set. But would they couple with each other?

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzaldehyde with a Cl, the ring would have four aromatic protons. Let's say positions 2,3,5,6.

Assuming that the aldehyde is in position 1, Cl in position 4.

Then, position 2 and 6 are each adjacent to the aldehyde, so they are ortho to CHO. Positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl, so ortho to Cl.

In this case, the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent due to the symmetry of the para substitution. Similarly, 3 and 5 would be equivalent.

Each of these sets could show as a doublet if they are coupled with each other. For example, the protons at 2 and 6 would each couple with the protons at 3 and 5, leading to a doublet for each. But wait, that's a more complex coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between adjacent protons. So, the protons at 2 and 3 would be adjacent, leading to coupling between them.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think about the NMR pattern in option A: 9.9 (1H, s) – likely the aldehyde proton. Then, 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So, the aldehyde is at 9.9, and the other protons are in two doublets.

So, in the aromatic region, the four protons are split into two groups: two as a doublet at 7.8, and another two as a doublet at 7.6. That suggests that the two sets are each coupling with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a meta-substituted ring, but that's less likely to give two doublets.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituents are in the para positions, and the aromatic protons are split into two doublets due to coupling between the two sets. Let me imagine that the protons ortho to the substituents are each a doublet because they're coupling with the adjacent protons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the substituents are both in the para positions, and the aromatic protons are in two sets of doublets.

Now, in the IR, the presence of a carbonyl group suggests a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, which is typical for aldehydes, ketones, esters, etc. The presence of an aromatic-halogen bond would show up as a C-X stretch, perhaps around 500-800 cm^-1, depending on the halogen.

So, the structure is likely a para-substituted benzaldehyde with a halogen, like Cl.

Now, looking at the NMR options again.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which is a good match for an aldehyde proton. The two doublets suggest the aromatic protons are split into two sets of two, each as a doublet. That could happen if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, leading to four aromatic protons, split into two groups, each with two protons.

In such a case, each set of two protons would be adjacent to each substituent, and the coupling would cause them to split into doublets.

So, the aromatic signals would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The aldehyde proton is a singlet because it's not coupled to any other protons (since it's on the end of the chain). But wait, in a benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to the aromatic ring. So, the aldehyde proton would have coupling with the adjacent aromatic protons, leading to splitting. But in the case where the substituents are para, the adjacent aromatic protons would be equivalent, leading to a singlet? Hmm, no, because the aldehyde proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons, which would cause a doublet.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again: in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the aldehyde is at position 1, and the Cl is at position 4. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the aldehyde, and the protons at positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to the Cl.

So, the aldehyde proton (position 1) is next to positions 2 and 6. So, the aldehyde proton would couple with protons 2 and 6. But in a para-substituted structure, protons 2 and 6 are equivalent. So, the aldehyde proton would be split into a doublet, but in the NMR, option A shows a singlet. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think about ortho coupling. The aldehyde proton (position 1) is adjacent to proton 2 and 6. So, each of those protons would be ortho to the aldehyde. But if both are equivalent, the coupling would be as if the aldehyde proton is coupled to two equivalent protons, leading to a triplet. Wait, but that's not the case here. In option A, the aldehyde proton is a singlet. So maybe that's not the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent isn't an aldehyde. Maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, if the substituent is a ketone group, like -COCH3, then the aldehyde proton wouldn't be present. So, let's think about that.

If the substituents are -COCH3 (in position 1) and Cl (in position 4), the ring would have a ketone and a Cl in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Let's consider their NMR signals.

The protons at 2 and 6 are adjacent to the ketone (COCH3), so they would be ortho to that group. The protons at 3 and 5 are adjacent to the Cl, so ortho to Cl.

In such a structure, the protons at 2 and 6 would be deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the ketone. The protons at 3 and 5 would be deshielded due to the Cl.

The coupling between these protons would lead to specific splitting patterns.

But without the aldehyde, the NMR wouldn't have a peak around 9.9 ppm. So, looking back at the options, option C has a peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which could be the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (like COCH3). Let's look at option C.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So, the 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H – likely a COCH3 group. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. So, that fits with the para-substituted structure where the ring has a COCH3 and a Cl in para positions.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two sets: the two ortho to COCH3 (positions 2 and 6) and the two ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). Each of these would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent protons.

Wait, but in that structure, positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to each other. So, their coupling would cause each other to split. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent, causing each to be a doublet.

But how would this appear in the NMR? Let me try to imagine:

Protons 2 and 6 are each next to protons 3 and 1 (the ketone). Wait, no, position 1 is the COCH3, position 4 is Cl.

So, proton 2 is adjacent to position 1 (COCH3) and 3. Proton 3 is adjacent to 2, 4 (Cl), and 6. Hmm, perhaps the coupling is more complex.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic ring would have symmetry, so that the protons adjacent to COCH3 (positions 2 and 6) are equivalent, and the protons adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) are equivalent.

In that case, the coupling between protons 2 and 3 would cause each to split into a doublet. So, the protons at 2 and 6 would each be coupled to the protons at 3 and 5, which are equivalent. So, each set (2 and 6, 3 and 5) would appear as a doublet.

This would match option C, where the aromatic signals are two doublets, each 2H, and a singlet for the COCH3 methyl group.

So, option C's NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the COCH3. That would fit with a para-substituted benzene ring with a ketone and a Cl.

But wait, the IR also shows a carbonyl group. A ketone would have a strong peak around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits.

So, the structure is 4-chloroacetophenone.

Now, let's check the other options to see if they fit.

Option A suggests an aldehyde (9.9 ppm), but that would require the substituent to be a CHO group, which adds one carbon. But earlier analysis suggests that the substituents are a Cl and a COCH3 group, which adds two carbons, making the total 8. So option A's structure would have a CHO group and a Cl, which would add two substituents but only one carbon (CHO is one carbon). So the total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) = 7, which doesn't match the 8 carbons given. So option A is incorrect.

Wait, wait, no. The substituent would be a CHO group (which is one carbon) and another substituent which adds one carbon, perhaps. For example, if one substituent is CHO (1C) and another is a CH2Cl group (but that would add more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a COX group that adds the necessary carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a COOR group, which would add more carbons. For example, if R is CH3, then the substituent adds two carbons (O-CO-OCH3?) No, COOR would be O-CO-R, so if R is CH3, it's O-CO-OCH3, which is three carbons? Wait, no, R is CH3, so the substituent is O-CO-CH3, which adds two carbons (O is not a carbon). So, substituent would be O-CO-CH3, which adds two carbons.

So, in that case, the ring would have a O-CO-CH3 group and a Cl group. So, that would be a total of 6 (ring) + 2 (COOCH3) + 0 (Cl) = 8 carbons.

In that case, the structure would be, say, 4-chlorobenzophenone, but wait, no, because benzophenone is a diaryl ketone. Alternatively, 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride? No, that's different.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group, O-CO-OCH3, which would add more carbons. But that would add three carbons (the O's don't count, so COOCH3 is three carbons). So the ring would have 6 +3 =9 carbons, which doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that the substituents are COCH3 and Cl, adding two carbons, making 8 total. So, this would fit with option C's NMR, which has a 3H singlet at 2.3 ppm, likely the COCH3 group.

So, going back, option C's NMR data would be correct for 4-chloroacetophenone, which has the carbonyl group (from the ketone) and the Cl in the para position.

Another option to check is option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). This seems to have only one aromatic proton, which suggests a highly substituted ring. But our structure has four aromatic protons, so this option is unlikely.

Option B: no aromatic protons, which can't be right because the compound is aromatic.

So, option C seems to fit.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. The total number of carbons (8) implies that the benzene ring (6 carbons) has two substituents adding 2 carbons in total. 

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks at 9.9 ppm (1H, s) suggest an aldehyde proton.  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets.  
   - Peak at 3.7 ppm (2H, s) suggests a methylene group.  
   - However, the total number of carbons in this structure would be 7 (6 from the benzene ring, 1 from the aldehyde, and 1 from the methylene group), which does not match the given total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), and 1.3 ppm (3H, s) suggest a structure with ether or acetal groups.  
   - There are no aromatic signals, which is inconsistent with the compound being an aromatic ring. This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) indicate two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets.  
   - Peak at 2.3 ppm (3H, s) suggests a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (e.g., COCH₃).  
   - This structure fits a para-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (e.g., COCH₃) and a halogen (e.g., Cl) in the para positions. The total number of carbons is 8 (6 from the benzene ring, 2 from the COCH₃ group), which matches the given data. This option is consistent with the compound.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peak at 6.9 ppm (1H, s) suggests a single aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with the compound being di-substituted.  
   - Peaks at 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), and 1.3 ppm (2H, s) suggest a structure with ether or acetal groups, but there are no aromatic signals besides the single proton. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct structure is a para-substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group (e.g., COCH₃) and a halogen (e.g., Cl) in the para positions. The NMR data in **Option C** matches this structure, with two doublets for the aromatic protons and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. 

Answer: C
