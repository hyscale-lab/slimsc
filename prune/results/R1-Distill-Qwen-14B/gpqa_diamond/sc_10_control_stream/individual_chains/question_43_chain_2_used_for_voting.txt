Okay, so I have this complex organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that when naming benzene derivatives, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. The functional groups are assigned priority, and the numbering starts from the principal functional group, which is usually the one with the highest priority.

The question states that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Hmm, meta means they're two positions apart. So, let's imagine the ring. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then the other two substituents (cyano and aldehyde) would be at positions 3 and 5, since they are meta to each other.

Wait, no, wait. The question says all three are meta to one another. So each pair is meta. That means their positions are 1, 3, and 5, right? Because if you have substituents at 1, 3, and 5, each is two positions away from the others, hence meta.

So, substituents: carboxylic acid at position 1, cyano (CN) at 3, and aldehyde (CHO) at 5? Or maybe another arrangement. I'll have to think about the other substituents given.

The problem also says that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino group (NMe₂). So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. The ortho positions are 2 and 6. So, one substituent in 2 and the other in 6. So, one is OH and the other is NMe₂.

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3). The para position is position 4. So, position 4 is OCH3.

Wait, but also, the methoxy and the alcohol (OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN). So the CN is in a position where its ortho positions include both OH and OCH3.

Let me try to sketch this:

Positions 1, 3, 5: substituents are COOH, CN, CHO.

Wait, no. The substituents meta to each other are COOH, CN, and CHO. So they must be at positions 1, 3, 5. Let me assume that COOH is at position 1.

Then, the substituents ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are OH and NMe₂. So, position 2 and 6 have OH and NMe₂.

The para to COOH is position 4, which has OCH3.

But wait, the methoxy (OCH3) is para to COOH, so it's at position 4.

Now, the methoxy group (OCH3) is at 4, and the OH is at either 2 or 6.

But the problem also says that both the methoxy and the hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile group (CN). So, the nitrile group must be in a position where its ortho are positions where OCH3 and OH are.

Wait, the nitrile is at 3. So, its ortho positions are 2 and 4. So, if position 2 has OH and position 4 has OCH3, that fits. Because then both OCH3 and OH are ortho to CN.

So, let me map this out:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: NMe₂

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, position 6 is ortho to COOH (position 1), so it's either OH or NMe₂. Position 6 in this case is NMe₂, and position 2 is OH.

Wait, but position 6 is next to position 1. So, position 6 is ortho to COOH.

So, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: NMe2.

Wait, but wait, the substituents meta to each other are COOH, CN, and CHO. So, COOH is at 1, CN at 3, and CHO at 5. That makes sense because 1,3,5 are all meta to each other (each is two apart).

Now, let's look at the other substituents:

COOH (1) has ortho (2 and 6) as OH and NMe2.

Para to COOH (1) is position 4: OCH3.

And the OCH3 is at 4, which is ortho to CN (3). So, that's correct because the ortho positions of 3 are 2 and 4.

Wait, no. Wait, the nitrile is at 3. Its ortho positions are 2 and 4. So, if OCH3 is at 4 and OH is at 2, then both are ortho to CN. That's correct.

So, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: NMe₂.

Now, to name this compound.

The parent chain is the benzoic acid, so the main group is benzoic acid. The substituents will be numbered based on the benzoic acid's numbering.

Wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. So, the numbering starts from COOH as position 1.

So, the substituents:

Position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: NMe2.

Wait, but we have to assign the substituent numbers in the order of their priority. The substituents are: CN, CHO, COOH, OCH3, NMe2, OH.

Wait, IUPAC nomenclature assigns priority to functional groups based on the seniority. The seniority order for substituents is based on their functional groups.

The order of priority for substituents is as follows (from highest to lowest):

1. Carboxylic acid (COOH) has the highest priority as the principal functional group. So, the numbering starts from COOH as position 1.

The other substituents are:

- Aldehyde (CHO): next priority.

- Nitrile (CN): also high.

Wait, no, the substituent priority order is determined by the first atom in the substituent. The order is based on the seniority of the substituent as a suffix.

Wait, I think the substituent priorities are based on the substituent's suffixes in IUPAC nomenclature. Higher priority substituents get lower numbers.

The substituent priority order is determined by the following ranking:

- Carboxylic acid (suffix -oic acid) has the highest priority.

- Aldehyde (-al) comes next.

- Nitrile (-nitrile) comes after.

Wait, no, I think the order is based on the functional group.

Wait, generally, the functional groups are ranked as follows (from highest to lowest priority):

1. Carboxylic acid (suffix -oic acid)

2. Aldehyde (-al)

3. Ketone (-one)

4. Amide (-amide)

5. Ester (-ate)

6. Nitrile (-nitrile)

7. Alkyl halide (-yl, but depends)

Wait, but I might be mixing up. Alternatively, the substituent priority is based on the alphabetical order when considering their suffixes, but in this case, it's more about the functional group's seniority.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent with the highest seniority is the one that gives the lowest possible numbers when assigned as the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to assign the substituents in order of their priority for numbering. That is, the principal functional group is the COOH, which is the main chain. Then, the substituents are numbered based on their positions relative to the COOH.

So, the substituents are:

- Position 2: OH

- Position 3: CN

- Position 4: OCH3

- Position 5: CHO

- Position 6: NMe2

Wait, but the substituents also include a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. So, the substituent at position 5 is formyl.

Now, when numbering the substituents, the highest priority substituent after the main chain is assigned the lowest possible number. But wait, the main chain is the benzoic acid, so the substituents are numbered in such a way.

Wait, perhaps the main chain is the benzene ring with the COOH group, so the numbering starts at COOH as position 1.

Now, the substituents in order of priority:

1. COOH (position 1)

2. CHO (position 5)

3. CN (position 3)

4. NMe2 (position 6)

5. OCH3 (position4)

6. OH (position2)

The other substituents are the hydroxyl (OH), dimethyl amino (NMe2), methoxy (OCH3), and nitrile (CN).

Wait, but the substituents are not just the main group, but all the groups attached. So the IUPAC name will list all substituents in alphabetical order after the main name.

Wait, the main name is benzoic acid, and the substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, but the substituents are:

At position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position4: OCH3

Position5: CHO (formyl)

Position6: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

So, the substituents are, in order of priority (based on their suffixes and alphabetical order):

CN (cyano), CHO (formyl), NMe2 (dimethylamino), OCH3 (methoxy), OH (hydroxy).

Wait, the substituents' order in the name is alphabetical, but for numbering, we look for the substituent with the highest priority to get the lowest number.

Wait, no. Wait, when numbering the substituents, the direction of numbering (clockwise or counterclockwise) is chosen to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. However, the substituent with the highest priority (according to their functional group) is given the lowest number.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are numbered in the order of their priority, regardless of direction. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, when numbering the substituents, the one with the highest priority is given the lowest number (number 1 for the main group, others get numbers based on their position from that).

So, in this case, the main group is COOH at position 1. Then, the next substituent with the highest priority would be the formyl (CHO), which is at position 5.

Wait, but position 5 is two positions away from position 1, but I'm trying to assign the numbers in a way that the substituent with the highest priority is numbered first.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all substituents and assign the numbers to get the lowest possible set of numbers.

Wait, the substituents and their positions are:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: OH

Position3: CN

Position4: OCH3

Position5: CHO

Position6: NMe2

So, the substituents besides COOH are:

At 2: OH (hydroxy)

3: CN (cyano)

4: OCH3 (methoxy)

5: CHO (formyl)

6: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

So, the substituents in order of their priority based on functional groups:

COOH (highest), then CHO (aldehyde), then CN (nitrile), then OCH3 (methoxy), then NMe2 (dimethylamino), then OH (hydroxy).

Wait, no. The priority order for substituents is determined by the functional group's seniority.

The seniority order for substituent groups is as follows (from highest to lowest):

1. -oic acid (carboxylic acid)

2. -al (aldehyde)

3. -nitrile (cyano)

4. -amino (amine)

5. -oxy (ether, methoxy)

6. -hydroxy (alcohol)

Wait, I'm not sure about this order. Let me think: Carboxylic acid is the highest, then aldehyde, then nitrile, then amide, then ether, then alcohol? Or perhaps different.

Alternatively, the seniority is determined by the first atom in the substituent, considering the substituent as a substituent. For example, -CN (nitrile) has a C with a triple bond to N. The priority is based on the atoms in the substituent.

Wait, here's another approach: The substituent with the highest priority is the one that comes first in alphabetical order. But wait, no, that's not correct. The substituents are numbered based on their priority, which is determined by the substituent's functional group.

Wait, perhaps the order is based on the suffix; the substituent with the suffix that comes first alphabetically gets lower numbers. Wait, no, that's not right either. The numbering is done to give the substituents with higher priority the lower numbers.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to determine the substituent with the highest priority, then assign the lowest possible number to it, then the next, etc.

The substituent priorities are as follows (from highest to lowest):

1. -oic acid (COOH, position 1)

2. -CHO (formyl, aldehyde, position5)

3. -CN (cyano, position3)

4. -NMe2 (dimethylamino, position6)

5. -OCH3 (methoxy, position4)

6. -OH (hydroxy, position2)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order between -NMe2 and -OCH3. The substituent with the higher priority is the one that comes first in the order.

Wait, the substituent priority order is determined by the first atom in the substituent. For example, for -NHMe2 (dimethylamino), the first atom is N. For -OCH3 (methoxy), it's O. Which comes first? O has a higher atomic number than N. So, the -OCH3 substituent would have higher priority than -NMe2.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: in substituent priority, the order is based on the first atom's atomic number. So, O (8) is higher than N (7), so O-containing substituents have higher priority than N-containing ones.

So, the priority order would be:

1. COOH

2. CHO (formyl)

3. CN (cyano)

4. OCH3 (methoxy)

5. NMe2 (dimethylamino)

6. OH (hydroxy)

So, substituents in order of priority:

COOH (position 1) > CHO (position5) > CN (3) > OCH3 (4) > NMe2 (6) > OH (2)

Wait, but when numbering the substituents for the name, the order is based on the substituent's priority. So, the substituent with the highest priority after the main group gets the next lowest number.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to number the substituents in the order of their priority so that the highest priority substituent gets the lowest possible number.

Wait, but in this case, the main group is COOH at 1. The next highest priority is CHO (formyl) at 5. Then CN at 3. Then OCH3 at 4. Then NMe2 at 6. Then OH at 2.

So, how would the numbering translate to the name?

The name would be benzoic acid with substituents at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

But the substituents are in the order of their priority in the name. So, the name lists the substituents in alphabetical order based on their suffixes, but the numbering is according to their positions based on the main group and substituent priorities.

Wait, the IUPAC name has the substituents in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So, the substituents are listed from the one with the earliest letter in the alphabet to the latest.

Looking at the substituents:

CN (cyano), CHO (formyl), OCH3 (methoxy), NMe2 (dimethylamino), OH (hydroxy). Wait, but also, the main group is COOH.

But in the options, the substituents are listed as:

Looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So, the substituents are in order: hydroxy (OH), cyano (CN), methoxy (OCH3), formyl (CHO), and dimethylamino (NMe2).

Wait, this doesn't seem to match the priority order. Because according to the priority, formyl (CHO) is higher than CN.

But in the name, the substituents are listed alphabetically, not in order of priority. So, the order in the name is determined by the alphabetical order of the substituent suffixes.

The suffixes are:

- hydroxy: -ol → 'hydroxy'

- cyano: -nitrile → 'cyano'

- methoxy: -oxy → 'methoxy'

- formyl: -al → 'formyl'

- dimethylamino: -amino → 'dimethylamino'

So, in alphabetical order, the substituents are:

1. Cyano (C comes before F, M, O, etc.)

Wait, no, the substituent names are:

1. Cyano (C comes first)

2. Dimethylamino (D comes next)

3. Formyl (F)

4. Hydroxy (H)

5. Methoxy (M)

Wait, no, wait. The substituent names are:

The substituent names, when written as substituents, are:

- 2-hydroxy

- 3-cyano

- 4-methoxy

- 5-formyl

- 6-(dimethylamino)

Wait, but the alphabetical order of the substituent prefixes would be based on the full name.

Wait, but in the IUPAC name, the substituents are arranged alphabetically, ignoring any prefixes like 'dimethyl' or 'methoxy'. So, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order of their suffixes.

Wait, no. The substituents are arranged alphabetically based on their entire name, including any prefixes. For example, 'cyano' comes before 'dimethylamino' because 'c' comes before 'd'. Similarly, 'formyl' comes after 'cyano' and 'dimethylamino' because 'f' comes after 'c' and 'd'.

So, the order in the name would be:

1. Cyano (3-cyano)

2. Dimethylamino (6-(dimethylamino))

3. Formyl (5-formyl)

4. Hydroxy (2-hydroxy)

5. Methoxy (4-methoxy)

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

In this option, the substituents are ordered as hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino.

But the correct alphabetical order should be cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but the substituent order in the name is the order in which they are written, not the alphabetical order. Wait, no, the substituents in the name are in alphabetical order. Let me check.

In IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order after the main name. So, the substituent names are arranged alphabetically, ignoring any prefixes. So, 'cyano' comes before 'dimethylamino' because 'c' comes before 'd'.

So, the substituents in the name would be listed as:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are written as: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, that seems to have hydroxy first, which is 'h' comes after 'c' and 'd', so that can't be correct. So option B would not be correct in the substituent order.

But wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think again.

The substituents are arranged in alphabetical order based on their full name, including any substituent prefixes. So:

-cyano (C comes first)

-dimethylamino (D comes second)

-formyl (F comes third)

-hydroxy (H comes fourth)

-methoxy (M comes last)

So, the substituent order should be cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

But looking at the options, option B has the substituents in the order: hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino.

That can't be right because 'hydroxy' comes after 'cyano' and 'dimethylamino' in alphabetical order.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.

The substituents are:

At position 2: OH → 2-hydroxy

Position3: CN → 3-cyano

Position4: OCH3 →4-methoxy

Position5: CHO →5-formyl

Position6: NMe2 →6-dimethylamino

So, the substituents are 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano,4-methoxy,5-formyl,6-dimethylamino.

Now, when listing substituents in the IUPAC name, they are arranged in alphabetical order, considering the entire substituent name.

So, the substituents are:

- 3-cyano

- 5-formyl

- 4-methoxy

- 6-dimethylamino

- 2-hydroxy

Wait, the substituent names are:

- Cyano

- Formyl

- Methoxy

- Dimethylamino

- Hydroxy

So, the alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, 'dimethylamino' (starts with 'd') comes after 'cyano' (c), and before 'formyl' (f), 'hydroxy' (h), and 'methoxy' (m).

So, the correct substituent order in the name should be:

3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

But looking at the options, option B is 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So, the substituents are listed as 2-hydroxy first, which would be incorrect because 'hydroxy' comes after 'dimethylamino' in the alphabetical order.

Alternatively, perhaps the priority is based on the substituent's position in the numbering, not the alphabetical order.

Wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions.

So, the correct order would be the substituents as cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So, the substituent list in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Looking at the options, which one has this order?

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

No, because in B, it's 2-hydroxy first, which is incorrect in terms of alphabetical order.

Option D:5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, no, that's not the case.

Option A:3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Option A's substituents are in the order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. But wait, the substituents are at positions 3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

So, the substituents in option A are ordered as cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. Which is the correct alphabetical order.

Wait, but option A's substituent order is 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Wait, the substituents would be arranged as cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy, which is correct.

But the name starts with 3-cyano, then 6-dimethylamino, then 5-formyl, etc.

So, the correct substituent order is as in option A.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, substituents in the order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Which matches the correct alphabetical order.

Wait, but the positions are:

cyano at 3,

dimethylamino at6,

formyl at5,

hydroxy at 2,

methoxy at4.

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions.

So, the name should be:

[correct order] (3-cyano)(6-dimethylamino)(5-formyl)(2-hydroxy)(4-methoxy)benzoic acid.

Which is option A.

But wait, let's check the substituent positions on the ring.

Wait, COOH is at position1.

Substituents:

Position2: OH → 2-hydroxy.

Position3: CN →3-cyano.

Position4:OCH3 →4-methoxy.

Position5:CHO →5-formyl.

Position6:NMe2 →6-dimethylamino.

So, the substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

In the name, substituents are ordered alphabetically, which would be 3-cyano first, then 6-dimethylamino, then 5-formyl, then 2-hydroxy, then 4-methoxy.

So the name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which matches option A.

Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Option A is: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

In option B, the substituents are ordered: hydroxy (2), cyano (3), methoxy (4), formyl (5), dimethylamino (6).

Which is incorrect in terms of alphabetical order because cyano (c) comes before hydroxy (h).

So, the correct order is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about option B, I thought the substituents were in the correct positions but perhaps incorrect order. But according to the IUPAC rules, the substituents must be listed in alphabetical order, so option A is correct.

Another way to look is that the substituent with the earliest letter in the alphabet is listed first. So, 'c' comes before 'd', 'f', 'h', 'm' in the substituent names.

So, the correct substituent order is cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Looking back at the options, option A starts with 3-cyano, then 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

That's the correct order.

So, the correct answer should be option B or option A? Wait, no, option A is the correct substituent order, but I'm confused because earlier I thought option B was correct.

Wait, wait. Let me check the positions again.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OCH3),5 (CHO),6 (NMe2).

So, the substituent names are:

2-hydroxy

3-cyano

4-methoxy

5-formyl

6-dimethylamino.

So, the substituents are 3-cyano, 5-formyl,4-methoxy,2-hydroxy,6-dimethylamino.

Wait, no, because in the IUPAC name, the substituents are written in alphabetical order, not in the order of their positions.

So, the substituent names in the correct order would be:

3-cyano

then 6-dimethylamino

then 5-formyl

then 2-hydroxy

then 4-methoxy.

So, the substituents in the name are written as 3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Which is exactly what option A says.

So, option A is the correct name.

Wait, but looking at the options again.

Option A:3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes. The substituents are listed in the order of cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct IUPAC name for the given molecule, the substituents on the benzene ring must be analyzed based on their positions and priorities. The molecule is a benzoic acid derivative with the following substituents:

1. **Carboxylic acid (COOH)** at position 1 (principal functional group).
2. **Hydroxyl (OH)** at position 2.
3. **Nitrile (CN)** at position 3.
4. **Methoxy (OCH₃)** at position 4.
5. **Formyl (CHO)** at position 5.
6. **Dimethylamino (NMe₂)** at position 6.

### Key Steps in the Naming Process:
1. **Substituent Priorities**: 
   - The substituents are ordered alphabetically based on their suffixes:
     - Cyano (-cyano)
     - Dimethylamino (-dimethylamino)
     - Formyl (-formyl)
     - Hydroxy (-hydroxy)
     - Methoxy (-methoxy)

2. **Substituent Positions**:
   - The substituents are located at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 relative to the carboxylic acid (position 1).

3. **Correct Substituent Order in the Name**:
   - The substituents must be listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions:
     - 3-cyano
     - 6-dimethylamino
     - 5-formyl
     - 2-hydroxy
     - 4-methoxy

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid  
     - This option lists the substituents in the correct alphabetical order and matches the positions of the substituents.
   - **Option B**: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid  
     - This option incorrectly lists "hydroxy" before "cyano" and "dimethylamino," violating the alphabetical order.
   - **Option C**: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid  
     - This option incorrectly lists "dimethylamino" and "formyl" before "cyano," violating the alphabetical order.
   - **Option D**: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid  
     - This option incorrectly lists "cyano" at position 5 instead of position 3, which does not match the given structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct IUPAC name is **Option A**, as it lists the substituents in the correct alphabetical order and matches their positions on the benzene ring.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this complex organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that when naming benzene derivatives, the substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. The functional groups are assigned priority, and the numbering starts from the principal functional group, which is usually the one with the highest priority.

The question states that the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Hmm, meta means they're two positions apart. So, let's imagine the ring. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then the other two substituents (cyano and aldehyde) would be at positions 3 and 5, since they are meta to each other.

Wait, no, wait. The question says all three are meta to one another. So each pair is meta. That means their positions are 1, 3, and 5, right? Because if you have substituents at 1, 3, and 5, each is two positions away from the others, hence meta.

So, substituents: carboxylic acid at position 1, cyano (CN) at 3, and aldehyde (CHO) at 5? Or maybe another arrangement. I'll have to think about the other substituents given.

The problem also says that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino group (NMe₂). So, the carboxylic acid is at position 1. The ortho positions are 2 and 6. So, one substituent in 2 and the other in 6. So, one is OH and the other is NMe₂.

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3). The para position is position 4. So, position 4 is OCH3.

Wait, but also, the methoxy and the alcohol (OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN). So the CN is in a position where its ortho positions include both OH and OCH3.

Let me try to sketch this:

Positions 1, 3, 5: substituents are COOH, CN, CHO.

Wait, no. The substituents meta to each other are COOH, CN, and CHO. So they must be at positions 1, 3, 5. Let me assume that COOH is at position 1.

Then, the substituents ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are OH and NMe₂. So, position 2 and 6 have OH and NMe₂.

The para to COOH is position 4, which has OCH3.

But wait, the methoxy (OCH3) is para to COOH, so it's at position 4.

Now, the methoxy group (OCH3) is at 4, and the OH is at either 2 or 6.

But the problem also says that both the methoxy and the hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile group (CN). So, the nitrile group must be in a position where its ortho are positions where OCH3 and OH are.

Wait, the nitrile is at 3. So, its ortho positions are 2 and 4. So, if position 2 has OH and position 4 has OCH3, that fits. Because then both OCH3 and OH are ortho to CN.

So, let me map this out:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: NMe₂

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, position 6 is ortho to COOH (position 1), so it's either OH or NMe₂. Position 6 in this case is NMe₂, and position 2 is OH.

Wait, but position 6 is next to position 1. So, position 6 is ortho to COOH.

So, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: NMe2.

Wait, but wait, the substituents meta to each other are COOH, CN, and CHO. So, COOH is at 1, CN at 3, and CHO at 5. That makes sense because 1,3,5 are all meta to each other (each is two apart).

Now, let's look at the other substituents:

COOH (1) has ortho (2 and 6) as OH and NMe2.

Para to COOH (1) is position 4: OCH3.

And the OCH3 is at 4, which is ortho to CN (3). So, that's correct because the ortho positions of 3 are 2 and 4.

Wait, no. Wait, the nitrile is at 3. Its ortho positions are 2 and 4. So, if OCH3 is at 4 and OH is at 2, then both are ortho to CN. That's correct.

So, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: NMe₂.

Now, to name this compound.

The parent chain is the benzoic acid, so the main group is benzoic acid. The substituents will be numbered based on the benzoic acid's numbering.

Wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1. So, the numbering starts from COOH as position 1.

So, the substituents:

Position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: NMe2.

Wait, but we have to assign the substituent numbers in the order of their priority. The substituents are: CN, CHO, COOH, OCH3, NMe2, OH.

Wait, IUPAC nomenclature assigns priority to functional groups based on the seniority. The seniority order for substituents is based on their functional groups.

The order of priority for substituents is as follows (from highest to lowest):

1. Carboxylic acid (COOH) has the highest priority as the principal functional group. So, the numbering starts from COOH as position 1.

The other substituents are:

- Aldehyde (CHO): next priority.

- Nitrile (CN): also high.

Wait, no, the substituent priority order is determined by the first atom in the substituent. The order is based on the seniority of the substituent as a suffix.

Wait, I think the substituent priorities are based on the substituent's suffixes in IUPAC nomenclature. Higher priority substituents get lower numbers.

The substituent priority order is determined by the following ranking:

- Carboxylic acid (suffix -oic acid) has the highest priority.

- Aldehyde (-al) comes next.

- Nitrile (-nitrile) comes after.

Wait, no, I think the order is based on the functional group.

Wait, generally, the functional groups are ranked as follows (from highest to lowest priority):

1. Carboxylic acid (suffix -oic acid)

2. Aldehyde (-al)

3. Ketone (-one)

4. Amide (-amide)

5. Ester (-ate)

6. Nitrile (-nitrile)

7. Alkyl halide (-yl, but depends)

Wait, but I might be mixing up. Alternatively, the substituent priority is based on the alphabetical order when considering their suffixes, but in this case, it's more about the functional group's seniority.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent with the highest seniority is the one that gives the lowest possible numbers when assigned as the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to assign the substituents in order of their priority for numbering. That is, the principal functional group is the COOH, which is the main chain. Then, the substituents are numbered based on their positions relative to the COOH.

So, the substituents are:

- Position 2: OH

- Position 3: CN

- Position 4: OCH3

- Position 5: CHO

- Position 6: NMe2

Wait, but the substituents also include a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde. So, the substituent at position 5 is formyl.

Now, when numbering the substituents, the highest priority substituent after the main chain is assigned the lowest possible number. But wait, the main chain is the benzoic acid, so the substituents are numbered in such a way.

Wait, perhaps the main chain is the benzene ring with the COOH group, so the numbering starts at COOH as position 1.

Now, the substituents in order of priority:

1. COOH (position 1)

2. CHO (position 5)

3. CN (position 3)

4. NMe2 (position 6)

5. OCH3 (position4)

6. OH (position2)

The other substituents are the hydroxyl (OH), dimethyl amino (NMe2), methoxy (OCH3), and nitrile (CN).

Wait, but the substituents are not just the main group, but all the groups attached. So the IUPAC name will list all substituents in alphabetical order after the main name.

Wait, the main name is benzoic acid, and the substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

Wait, but the substituents are:

At position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position4: OCH3

Position5: CHO (formyl)

Position6: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

So, the substituents are, in order of priority (based on their suffixes and alphabetical order):

CN (cyano), CHO (formyl), NMe2 (dimethylamino), OCH3 (methoxy), OH (hydroxy).

Wait, the substituents' order in the name is alphabetical, but for numbering, we look for the substituent with the highest priority to get the lowest number.

Wait, no. Wait, when numbering the substituents, the direction of numbering (clockwise or counterclockwise) is chosen to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. However, the substituent with the highest priority (according to their functional group) is given the lowest number.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are numbered in the order of their priority, regardless of direction. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, when numbering the substituents, the one with the highest priority is given the lowest number (number 1 for the main group, others get numbers based on their position from that).

So, in this case, the main group is COOH at position 1. Then, the next substituent with the highest priority would be the formyl (CHO), which is at position 5.

Wait, but position 5 is two positions away from position 1, but I'm trying to assign the numbers in a way that the substituent with the highest priority is numbered first.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all substituents and assign the numbers to get the lowest possible set of numbers.

Wait, the substituents and their positions are:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: OH

Position3: CN

Position4: OCH3

Position5: CHO

Position6: NMe2

So, the substituents besides COOH are:

At 2: OH (hydroxy)

3: CN (cyano)

4: OCH3 (methoxy)

5: CHO (formyl)

6: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

So, the substituents in order of their priority based on functional groups:

COOH (highest), then CHO (aldehyde), then CN (nitrile), then OCH3 (methoxy), then NMe2 (dimethylamino), then OH (hydroxy).

Wait, no. The priority order for substituents is determined by the functional group's seniority.

The seniority order for substituent groups is as follows (from highest to lowest):

1. -oic acid (carboxylic acid)

2. -al (aldehyde)

3. -nitrile (cyano)

4. -amino (amine)

5. -oxy (ether, methoxy)

6. -hydroxy (alcohol)

Wait, I'm not sure about this order. Let me think: Carboxylic acid is the highest, then aldehyde, then nitrile, then amide, then ether, then alcohol? Or perhaps different.

Alternatively, the seniority is determined by the first atom in the substituent, considering the substituent as a substituent. For example, -CN (nitrile) has a C with a triple bond to N. The priority is based on the atoms in the substituent.

Wait, here's another approach: The substituent with the highest priority is the one that comes first in alphabetical order. But wait, no, that's not correct. The substituents are numbered based on their priority, which is determined by the substituent's functional group.

Wait, perhaps the order is based on the suffix; the substituent with the suffix that comes first alphabetically gets lower numbers. Wait, no, that's not right either. The numbering is done to give the substituents with higher priority the lower numbers.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to determine the substituent with the highest priority, then assign the lowest possible number to it, then the next, etc.

The substituent priorities are as follows (from highest to lowest):

1. -oic acid (COOH, position 1)

2. -CHO (formyl, aldehyde, position5)

3. -CN (cyano, position3)

4. -NMe2 (dimethylamino, position6)

5. -OCH3 (methoxy, position4)

6. -OH (hydroxy, position2)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the order between -NMe2 and -OCH3. The substituent with the higher priority is the one that comes first in the order.

Wait, the substituent priority order is determined by the first atom in the substituent. For example, for -NHMe2 (dimethylamino), the first atom is N. For -OCH3 (methoxy), it's O. Which comes first? O has a higher atomic number than N. So, the -OCH3 substituent would have higher priority than -NMe2.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: in substituent priority, the order is based on the first atom's atomic number. So, O (8) is higher than N (7), so O-containing substituents have higher priority than N-containing ones.

So, the priority order would be:

1. COOH

2. CHO (formyl)

3. CN (cyano)

4. OCH3 (methoxy)

5. NMe2 (dimethylamino)

6. OH (hydroxy)

So, substituents in order of priority:

COOH (position 1) > CHO (position5) > CN (3) > OCH3 (4) > NMe2 (6) > OH (2)

Wait, but when numbering the substituents for the name, the order is based on the substituent's priority. So, the substituent with the highest priority after the main group gets the next lowest number.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to number the substituents in the order of their priority so that the highest priority substituent gets the lowest possible number.

Wait, but in this case, the main group is COOH at 1. The next highest priority is CHO (formyl) at 5. Then CN at 3. Then OCH3 at 4. Then NMe2 at 6. Then OH at 2.

So, how would the numbering translate to the name?

The name would be benzoic acid with substituents at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

But the substituents are in the order of their priority in the name. So, the name lists the substituents in alphabetical order based on their suffixes, but the numbering is according to their positions based on the main group and substituent priorities.

Wait, the IUPAC name has the substituents in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So, the substituents are listed from the one with the earliest letter in the alphabet to the latest.

Looking at the substituents:

CN (cyano), CHO (formyl), OCH3 (methoxy), NMe2 (dimethylamino), OH (hydroxy). Wait, but also, the main group is COOH.

But in the options, the substituents are listed as:

Looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So, the substituents are in order: hydroxy (OH), cyano (CN), methoxy (OCH3), formyl (CHO), and dimethylamino (NMe2).

Wait, this doesn't seem to match the priority order. Because according to the priority, formyl (CHO) is higher than CN.

But in the name, the substituents are listed alphabetically, not in order of priority. So, the order in the name is determined by the alphabetical order of the substituent suffixes.

The suffixes are:

- hydroxy: -ol → 'hydroxy'

- cyano: -nitrile → 'cyano'

- methoxy: -oxy → 'methoxy'

- formyl: -al → 'formyl'

- dimethylamino: -amino → 'dimethylamino'

So, in alphabetical order, the substituents are:

1. Cyano (C comes before F, M, O, etc.)

Wait, no, the substituent names are:

1. Cyano (C comes first)

2. Dimethylamino (D comes next)

3. Formyl (F)

4. Hydroxy (H)

5. Methoxy (M)

Wait, no, wait. The substituent names are:

The substituent names, when written as substituents, are:

- 2-hydroxy

- 3-cyano

- 4-methoxy

- 5-formyl

- 6-(dimethylamino)

Wait, but the alphabetical order of the substituent prefixes would be based on the full name.

Wait, but in the IUPAC name, the substituents are arranged alphabetically, ignoring any prefixes like 'dimethyl' or 'methoxy'. So, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order of their suffixes.

Wait, no. The substituents are arranged alphabetically based on their entire name, including any prefixes. For example, 'cyano' comes before 'dimethylamino' because 'c' comes before 'd'. Similarly, 'formyl' comes after 'cyano' and 'dimethylamino' because 'f' comes after 'c' and 'd'.

So, the order in the name would be:

1. Cyano (3-cyano)

2. Dimethylamino (6-(dimethylamino))

3. Formyl (5-formyl)

4. Hydroxy (2-hydroxy)

5. Methoxy (4-methoxy)

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

In this option, the substituents are ordered as hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino.

But the correct alphabetical order should be cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but the substituent order in the name is the order in which they are written, not the alphabetical order. Wait, no, the substituents in the name are in alphabetical order. Let me check.

In IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order after the main name. So, the substituent names are arranged alphabetically, ignoring any prefixes. So, 'cyano' comes before 'dimethylamino' because 'c' comes before 'd'.

So, the substituents in the name would be listed as:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are written as: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, that seems to have hydroxy first, which is 'h' comes after 'c' and 'd', so that can't be correct. So option B would not be correct in the substituent order.

But wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think again.

The substituents are arranged in alphabetical order based on their full name, including any substituent prefixes. So:

-cyano (C comes first)

-dimethylamino (D comes second)

-formyl (F comes third)

-hydroxy (H comes fourth)

-methoxy (M comes last)

So, the substituent order should be cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

But looking at the options, option B has the substituents in the order: hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino.

That can't be right because 'hydroxy' comes after 'cyano' and 'dimethylamino' in alphabetical order.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently.

The substituents are:

At position 2: OH → 2-hydroxy

Position3: CN → 3-cyano

Position4: OCH3 →4-methoxy

Position5: CHO →5-formyl

Position6: NMe2 →6-dimethylamino

So, the substituents are 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano,4-methoxy,5-formyl,6-dimethylamino.

Now, when listing substituents in the IUPAC name, they are arranged in alphabetical order, considering the entire substituent name.

So, the substituents are:

- 3-cyano

- 5-formyl

- 4-methoxy

- 6-dimethylamino

- 2-hydroxy

Wait, the substituent names are:

- Cyano

- Formyl

- Methoxy

- Dimethylamino

- Hydroxy

So, the alphabetical order is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, 'dimethylamino' (starts with 'd') comes after 'cyano' (c), and before 'formyl' (f), 'hydroxy' (h), and 'methoxy' (m).

So, the correct substituent order in the name should be:

3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

But looking at the options, option B is 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So, the substituents are listed as 2-hydroxy first, which would be incorrect because 'hydroxy' comes after 'dimethylamino' in the alphabetical order.

Alternatively, perhaps the priority is based on the substituent's position in the numbering, not the alphabetical order.

Wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions.

So, the correct order would be the substituents as cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So, the substituent list in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Looking at the options, which one has this order?

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

No, because in B, it's 2-hydroxy first, which is incorrect in terms of alphabetical order.

Option D:5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, no, that's not the case.

Option A:3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Option A's substituents are in the order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. But wait, the substituents are at positions 3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

So, the substituents in option A are ordered as cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. Which is the correct alphabetical order.

Wait, but option A's substituent order is 3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Wait, the substituents would be arranged as cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy, which is correct.

But the name starts with 3-cyano, then 6-dimethylamino, then 5-formyl, etc.

So, the correct substituent order is as in option A.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, substituents in the order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Which matches the correct alphabetical order.

Wait, but the positions are:

cyano at 3,

dimethylamino at6,

formyl at5,

hydroxy at 2,

methoxy at4.

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions.

So, the name should be:

[correct order] (3-cyano)(6-dimethylamino)(5-formyl)(2-hydroxy)(4-methoxy)benzoic acid.

Which is option A.

But wait, let's check the substituent positions on the ring.

Wait, COOH is at position1.

Substituents:

Position2: OH → 2-hydroxy.

Position3: CN →3-cyano.

Position4:OCH3 →4-methoxy.

Position5:CHO →5-formyl.

Position6:NMe2 →6-dimethylamino.

So, the substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

In the name, substituents are ordered alphabetically, which would be 3-cyano first, then 6-dimethylamino, then 5-formyl, then 2-hydroxy, then 4-methoxy.

So the name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which matches option A.

Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Option A is: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

In option B, the substituents are ordered: hydroxy (2), cyano (3), methoxy (4), formyl (5), dimethylamino (6).

Which is incorrect in terms of alphabetical order because cyano (c) comes before hydroxy (h).

So, the correct order is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about option B, I thought the substituents were in the correct positions but perhaps incorrect order. But according to the IUPAC rules, the substituents must be listed in alphabetical order, so option A is correct.

Another way to look is that the substituent with the earliest letter in the alphabet is listed first. So, 'c' comes before 'd', 'f', 'h', 'm' in the substituent names.

So, the correct substituent order is cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Looking back at the options, option A starts with 3-cyano, then 6-dimethylamino, 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

That's the correct order.

So, the correct answer should be option B or option A? Wait, no, option A is the correct substituent order, but I'm confused because earlier I thought option B was correct.

Wait, wait. Let me check the positions again.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OCH3),5 (CHO),6 (NMe2).

So, the substituent names are:

2-hydroxy

3-cyano

4-methoxy

5-formyl

6-dimethylamino.

So, the substituents are 3-cyano, 5-formyl,4-methoxy,2-hydroxy,6-dimethylamino.

Wait, no, because in the IUPAC name, the substituents are written in alphabetical order, not in the order of their positions.

So, the substituent names in the correct order would be:

3-cyano

then 6-dimethylamino

then 5-formyl

then 2-hydroxy

then 4-methoxy.

So, the substituents in the name are written as 3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Which is exactly what option A says.

So, option A is the correct name.

Wait, but looking at the options again.

Option A:3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes. The substituents are listed in the order of cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


To determine the correct IUPAC name for the given molecule, the substituents on the benzene ring must be analyzed based on their positions and priorities. The molecule is a benzoic acid derivative with the following substituents:

1. **Carboxylic acid (COOH)** at position 1 (principal functional group).
2. **Hydroxyl (OH)** at position 2.
3. **Nitrile (CN)** at position 3.
4. **Methoxy (OCH₃)** at position 4.
5. **Formyl (CHO)** at position 5.
6. **Dimethylamino (NMe₂)** at position 6.

### Key Steps in the Naming Process:
1. **Substituent Priorities**: 
   - The substituents are ordered alphabetically based on their suffixes:
     - Cyano (-cyano)
     - Dimethylamino (-dimethylamino)
     - Formyl (-formyl)
     - Hydroxy (-hydroxy)
     - Methoxy (-methoxy)

2. **Substituent Positions**:
   - The substituents are located at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 relative to the carboxylic acid (position 1).

3. **Correct Substituent Order in the Name**:
   - The substituents must be listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions:
     - 3-cyano
     - 6-dimethylamino
     - 5-formyl
     - 2-hydroxy
     - 4-methoxy

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid  
     - This option lists the substituents in the correct alphabetical order and matches the positions of the substituents.
   - **Option B**: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid  
     - This option incorrectly lists "hydroxy" before "cyano" and "dimethylamino," violating the alphabetical order.
   - **Option C**: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid  
     - This option incorrectly lists "dimethylamino" and "formyl" before "cyano," violating the alphabetical order.
   - **Option D**: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid  
     - This option incorrectly lists "cyano" at position 5 instead of position 3, which does not match the given structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct IUPAC name is **Option A**, as it lists the substituents in the correct alphabetical order and matches their positions on the benzene ring.

**Answer: A**
