Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and then determine which statement among the options A to D is correct.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the first step is to write down the matrix Ay. Since c is h/(4π), and S is given, let's compute Ay.

Matrix S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So, multiplying by c = h/(4π), each element of S gets multiplied by c. So,

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * S.

So, Ay's matrix becomes:

[ (h/(4π))*0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i    (h/(4π))*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   0 ]

Wait, I think I should compute that correctly. So, each element is multiplied by c.

So, the matrix is:

[ 0       (-i c) ]
[ (i c)      0 ]

Since c is h/(4π), that's right.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a     (-i c) ]
[ (i c)   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i c)(-i c).

Wait, let's compute that. The product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i c)(i c). Let me compute that:

(-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c^2. Since (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So, it's (1) * c^2.

So the determinant is a² - (1)(c²) = a² - c² = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c.

Wait, so since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right?

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh or ±something else? Wait, option A says the imaginary parts are +2πh or –2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). But wait, wait, we just found that the eigenvalues are a = ±c, so a is real. So their imaginary parts are zero. So option A's statement about the imaginary parts can't be correct because the eigenvalues are real. So option A is not correct.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, no, because our eigenvalues are real. So option B is also incorrect because it's talking about complex eigenvalues.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az (the Z-component). Let me think. For angular momentum operators, [A², Ay] should commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So that makes sense. But what about Az? Well, the components of angular momentum don't commute with each other. So if a function is an eigenfunction of Ay, it won't be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C is correct in that sense.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not entirely certain. The basis functions of a 2x2 matrix are probably the standard basis vectors. But the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay would form a basis for the vector space, assuming Ay is diagonalizable. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix with two eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable. So the eigenvectors would form a basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Wait, but the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis. So the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator's function space, but perhaps D is stating it correctly. Or maybe D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

Wait, but let me think again. The matrix operator Ay acts on a two-dimensional vector space. The eigenvectors of Ay are two in number (since it's 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues), so they form a basis. So the eigenfunctions φ are the basis for the operator. So option D could be correct.

Wait, but option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. Because A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay (since [A², Ay] =0), so they share eigenfunctions. So C is correct in that aspect.

So, which options are correct between C and D?

Looking back at the options:

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute, so their eigenfunctions can be shared. But Az and Ay don't commute, so if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az simultaneously.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm less sure about this. The basis functions of the operator's matrix are the standard basis vectors (like |+> and |-> for spin). The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which are specific vectors. So perhaps D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the operator Ay. It's 2x2, so its eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay will form a basis for the system's state space. So D says they're the basis functions of the operator. That sounds correct. Because if you have two eigenvectors, they can form the basis. So D could be correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to summarize:

Eigenvalues of Ay are ±c = ±h/(4π).

So looking back, the options:

A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

B: Eigenvalues are imaginary ±1/2 and real ±1. No, because eigenvalues are real. So B is incorrect.

C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct because A² commutes with Ay, so same eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't, so eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az.

D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the operator's matrix is 2x2, so the basis functions are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvectors are specific vectors that form a basis. So D is correct in the sense that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space.

So, which of the options is correct? The question is which statement is correct during the calculation, i.e., which is a correct statement.

So, let's check the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, but perhaps they're not necessarily the standard basis. So D might not be correct. Because the basis functions are the standard basis, but the eigenvectors are specific to the operator. So if the operator's matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then the eigenvectors are the basis of the operator. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is D. Because the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator's matrix. Because when you write the matrix in its eigenbasis, it's diagonal. So yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but if the operator is 2x2, then the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are two vectors that span the space, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

So, which of the options is correct?

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So, during the calculation, which statements are correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute, so they share eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A².

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, that's also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is the same as the basis for the operator's matrix.

So both C and D could be correct. But I need to read the problem again.

Wait, the question is to determine which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, let me think about the possible options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So that's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions, but Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. So that is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the question again.

The question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So, perhaps multiple options could be correct, but the options are presented as single correct.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, so the eigenvectors form a basis for the matrix operator. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors will form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question says "which statement will you consider to be correct". So perhaps more than one option is correct, but the options are presented as single choices. So I must choose the correct one.

But looking at the problem statement again, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, let me think again. Let's compute the eigenvectors for Ay.

Ay has eigenvalues a = c and a = -c.

So for a = c, let's find eigenvectors.

Ay - c I = [ -c   -i c ]

           [ i c   -c ]

We can write the equations:

(-c) φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0 → (-c)φ₁ = i c φ₂ → φ₁ = (-i) φ₂.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -c, the matrix becomes [ c   -i c ]

[ i c    c ]

The equations:

c φ₁ - i c φ₂ =0 → φ₁ = (i) φ₂.

So the eigenvectors are [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

These are the eigenfunctions. So, the eigenvectors are the functions φ₁ and φ₂.

So, for option C: eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum. Let me compute A².

A² = (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 + (Ax)^2. But perhaps in this case, since we are dealing with spin-½ particles, the square of the angular momentum operator would be (ℏ² s(s+1)) where s=1/2. Wait, but let me think carefully.

Wait, for spin systems, the square of the angular momentum operator is given by A² = (ℏ²) s(s+1) I, where I is the identity matrix. Since s=1/2 for a muon (a spin-½ particle), A² = ( (ℏ)^2 ) * (1/2)(3/2) ) I = (3 ℏ² /4 ) I.

So any state is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue 3 ℏ² /4.

So eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix, so all vectors are eigenfunctions.

So option C is correct: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A².

Now, option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the matrix operator Ay is represented in some basis. The eigenvectors of Ay form an orthonormal basis for the space. So, they are the basis functions. So D is also correct.

Wait, but the basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions are specific to the operator and are not necessarily the standard basis. So perhaps D is correct only if the eigenfunctions are the standard basis. But in our case, the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Wait, but a basis is any set of vectors that spans the space. So the eigenfunctions form a basis, but perhaps they are not the standard basis. So the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm. So the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and its basis is the standard basis. The eigenvectors are a different basis. So D's statement might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the matrix operator's representation depends on the basis. If you choose the eigenbasis of Ay as your basis, then the matrix becomes diagonal. So in that basis, the matrix is diagonal, and the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in their own basis.

But the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the standard basis may not be the same as the eigenbasis. So the statement in D is that the eigenfunctions are the basis for Ay. I think that's correct because the eigenvectors span the space, so they can be considered a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm. So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, I need to find which is correct.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Well, from the above, both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, wait, the answer options may have only one correct statement.

Wait, let me think about the possible answers again.

The eigenvalues are real, so A and B are incorrect.

So, now between C and D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Which is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space that the operator acts on.

So, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, I need to choose which one is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both options C and D are correct.

But in the given options, only one can be correct. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So, in reality, both statements are correct.

Wait, but looking back, the options may have only one correct statement.

Wait, the problem says the operator is Ay. Let me think about the properties:

The eigenfunctions of Ay (eigenvectors) are not the same as the eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

As for D, the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. So D is correct.

Wait, perhaps in the context of quantum mechanics, the basis functions are the standard basis, but the eigenvectors can form another basis. So D is correct in that the eigenfunctions form a basis, but perhaps they are not the standard basis.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is correct. Because the operator's matrix is expressed in a certain basis, which could be the eigenbasis. So the statement in D depends on what the basis functions are.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the given matrix S. The matrix S given is the same as the Pauli Y matrix times some factor. Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is indeed the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Wait, wait. Let me compute S again.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is defined as:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

Which is exactly the S given. So S is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by 1. Then, Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π).

So, the eigenvalues of S would be ±1 (since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1). So the eigenvalues of Ay would be ±c = ±h/(4π).

Now, the square of the angular momentum operator A² is given by (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 + (Ax)^2. But since we're dealing with spin-½ particles, A² = (ℏ^2) (s(s+1)) I, where s=1/2. So, A² = (ℏ^2) (3/4) I.

So, any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue 3ℏ²/4.

Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

So, looking back, the correct options are C and D? Or only C?

Wait, the question says 'which statement will you consider to be correct' during the calculation. So, all the statements may be correct, but perhaps only one is.

Wait, perhaps D is incorrect. Because the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis, unless the operator is diagonalized.

So, the basis functions of the matrix operator would typically be the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which may not be the standard basis. So, the statement in D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis functions; they're specific eigenvectors.

Hence, option D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct statement is option C.

So, during the calculation, option C is correct: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

The problem involves determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \((0, -i)\) and the second row \((i, 0)\). The task is to evaluate which statement among the options is correct during the calculation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix, and \( A_y \) is proportional to \( S \). Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). The determinant calculation yields:
   \[
   a^2 = \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2.
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** This claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, with no imaginary components.
   - **Option B:** This claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so they share eigenfunctions. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** This claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, they are not necessarily the standard basis functions of the operator. Thus, this statement is ambiguous and not strictly correct.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Among the options, only **Option C** is correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \), consistent with the commutation relations in angular momentum theory.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and then determine which statement among the options A to D is correct.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the first step is to write down the matrix Ay. Since c is h/(4π), and S is given, let's compute Ay.

Matrix S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So, multiplying by c = h/(4π), each element of S gets multiplied by c. So,

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * S.

So, Ay's matrix becomes:

[ (h/(4π))*0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
[ (h/(4π))*i    (h/(4π))*0 ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0   -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)   0 ]

Wait, I think I should compute that correctly. So, each element is multiplied by c.

So, the matrix is:

[ 0       (-i c) ]
[ (i c)      0 ]

Since c is h/(4π), that's right.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a     (-i c) ]
[ (i c)   -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i c)(-i c).

Wait, let's compute that. The product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i c)(i c). Let me compute that:

(-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c^2. Since (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So, it's (1) * c^2.

So the determinant is a² - (1)(c²) = a² - c² = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c.

Wait, so since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, right?

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±2πh or ±something else? Wait, option A says the imaginary parts are +2πh or –2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). But wait, wait, we just found that the eigenvalues are a = ±c, so a is real. So their imaginary parts are zero. So option A's statement about the imaginary parts can't be correct because the eigenvalues are real. So option A is not correct.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, no, because our eigenvalues are real. So option B is also incorrect because it's talking about complex eigenvalues.

So that leaves options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az (the Z-component). Let me think. For angular momentum operators, [A², Ay] should commute, so eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So that makes sense. But what about Az? Well, the components of angular momentum don't commute with each other. So if a function is an eigenfunction of Ay, it won't be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C is correct in that sense.

But the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay would form a basis for the vector space, assuming Ay is diagonalizable. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix with two eigenvalues, it's diagonalizable. So the eigenvectors would form a basis. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Wait, but the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis. So the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator's function space, but perhaps D is stating it correctly. Or maybe D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

Wait, but let me think again. The matrix operator Ay acts on a two-dimensional vector space. The eigenvectors of Ay are two in number (since it's 2x2 and has two distinct eigenvalues), so they form a basis. So the eigenfunctions φ are the basis for the operator. So option D could be correct.

Wait, but option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. Because A² is the square of the angular momentum, which commutes with Ay (since [A², Ay] =0), so they share eigenfunctions. So C is correct in that aspect.

So, which options are correct between C and D?

Looking back at the options:

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute, so their eigenfunctions can be shared. But Az and Ay don't commute, so if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az simultaneously.

A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts are ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

C: Eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct because A² commutes with Ay, so same eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't, so eigenfunctions of Ay can't be eigenfunctions of Az.

D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Well, the operator's matrix is 2x2, so the basis functions are the standard basis vectors. The eigenvectors are specific vectors that form a basis. So D is correct in the sense that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space.

So, which of the options is correct? The question is which statement is correct during the calculation, i.e., which is a correct statement.

So, let's check the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunction can also be an eigenfunction of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space, but perhaps they're not necessarily the standard basis. So D might not be correct. Because the basis functions are the standard basis, but the eigenvectors are specific to the operator. So if the operator's matrix is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then the eigenvectors are the basis of the operator. I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is D. Because the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator's matrix. Because when you write the matrix in its eigenbasis, it's diagonal. So yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis for the matrix operator. So D is correct.

Wait, but if the operator is 2x2, then the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are two vectors that span the space, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

So, which of the options is correct?

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So, during the calculation, which statements are correct.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² and Ay commute, so they share eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A².

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, that's also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space, which is the same as the basis for the operator's matrix.

So both C and D could be correct. But I need to read the problem again.

Wait, the question is to determine which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, let me think about the possible options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So that's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions, but Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. So that is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the question again.

The question says which statement is correct during the calculation. So, perhaps multiple options could be correct, but the options are presented as single correct.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Wait, but the question says "which statement will you consider to be correct". So perhaps more than one option is correct, but the options are presented as single choices. So I must choose the correct one.

But looking at the problem statement again, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, let me think again. Let's compute the eigenvectors for Ay.

Ay has eigenvalues a = c and a = -c.

So for a = c, let's find eigenvectors.

Ay - c I = [ -c   -i c ]

           [ i c   -c ]

We can write the equations:

(-c) φ₁ - i c φ₂ = 0 → (-c)φ₁ = i c φ₂ → φ₁ = (-i) φ₂.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -c, the matrix becomes [ c   -i c ]

[ i c    c ]

The equations:

c φ₁ - i c φ₂ =0 → φ₁ = (i) φ₂.

So the eigenvectors are [ i, 1 ]^T.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

These are the eigenfunctions. So, the eigenvectors are the functions φ₁ and φ₂.

So, for option C: eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A².

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum. Let me compute A².

A² = (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 + (Ax)^2. But perhaps in this case, since we are dealing with spin-½ particles, the square of the angular momentum operator would be (ℏ² s(s+1)) where s=1/2. Wait, but let me think carefully.

Wait, for spin systems, the square of the angular momentum operator is given by A² = (ℏ²) s(s+1) I, where I is the identity matrix. Since s=1/2 for a muon (a spin-½ particle), A² = ( (ℏ)^2 ) * (1/2)(3/2) ) I = (3 ℏ² /4 ) I.

So any state is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue 3 ℏ² /4.

So eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity matrix, so all vectors are eigenfunctions.

So option C is correct: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A².

Now, option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the matrix operator Ay is represented in some basis. The eigenvectors of Ay form an orthonormal basis for the space. So, they are the basis functions. So D is also correct.

Wait, but the basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions are specific to the operator and are not necessarily the standard basis. So perhaps D is correct only if the eigenfunctions are the standard basis. But in our case, the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

Wait, but a basis is any set of vectors that spans the space. So the eigenfunctions form a basis, but perhaps they are not the standard basis. So the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm. So the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and its basis is the standard basis. The eigenvectors are a different basis. So D's statement might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the matrix operator's representation depends on the basis. If you choose the eigenbasis of Ay as your basis, then the matrix becomes diagonal. So in that basis, the matrix is diagonal, and the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions in their own basis.

But the question is whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, but the standard basis may not be the same as the eigenbasis. So the statement in D is that the eigenfunctions are the basis for Ay. I think that's correct because the eigenvectors span the space, so they can be considered a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm. So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, I need to find which is correct.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Well, from the above, both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, wait, the answer options may have only one correct statement.

Wait, let me think about the possible answers again.

The eigenvalues are real, so A and B are incorrect.

So, now between C and D.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Which is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space that the operator acts on.

So, perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, I need to choose which one is correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both options C and D are correct.

But in the given options, only one can be correct. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So, in reality, both statements are correct.

Wait, but looking back, the options may have only one correct statement.

Wait, the problem says the operator is Ay. Let me think about the properties:

The eigenfunctions of Ay (eigenvectors) are not the same as the eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

As for D, the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. So D is correct.

Wait, perhaps in the context of quantum mechanics, the basis functions are the standard basis, but the eigenvectors can form another basis. So D is correct in that the eigenfunctions form a basis, but perhaps they are not the standard basis.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is correct. Because the operator's matrix is expressed in a certain basis, which could be the eigenbasis. So the statement in D depends on what the basis functions are.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the matrix. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the given matrix S. The matrix S given is the same as the Pauli Y matrix times some factor. Because the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is indeed the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i? Wait, wait. Let me compute S again.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is defined as:

[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

Which is exactly the S given. So S is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by 1. Then, Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π).

So, the eigenvalues of S would be ±1 (since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1). So the eigenvalues of Ay would be ±c = ±h/(4π).

Now, the square of the angular momentum operator A² is given by (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 + (Ax)^2. But since we're dealing with spin-½ particles, A² = (ℏ^2) (s(s+1)) I, where s=1/2. So, A² = (ℏ^2) (3/4) I.

So, any vector is an eigenfunction of A² with eigenvalue 3ℏ²/4.

Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

So, looking back, the correct options are C and D? Or only C?

Wait, the question says 'which statement will you consider to be correct' during the calculation. So, all the statements may be correct, but perhaps only one is.

Wait, perhaps D is incorrect. Because the matrix operator's basis is the standard basis, unless the operator is diagonalized.

So, the basis functions of the matrix operator would typically be the standard basis vectors. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors, which may not be the standard basis. So, the statement in D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis functions; they're specific eigenvectors.

Hence, option D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct statement is option C.

So, during the calculation, option C is correct: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.


The problem involves determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the first row \((0, -i)\) and the second row \((i, 0)\). The task is to evaluate which statement among the options is correct during the calculation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Matrix Representation of \( A_y \):**
   The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix, and \( A_y \) is proportional to \( S \). Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:
   \[
   A_y = \begin{bmatrix}
   0 & -i \frac{h}{4\pi} \\
   i \frac{h}{4\pi} & 0
   \end{bmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   To find the eigenvalues, solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). The determinant calculation yields:
   \[
   a^2 = \left(\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)^2.
   \]
   Thus, the eigenvalues are \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** This claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, with no imaginary components.
   - **Option B:** This claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).
   - **Option C:** This states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), so they share eigenfunctions. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) cannot be eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** This claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, they are not necessarily the standard basis functions of the operator. Thus, this statement is ambiguous and not strictly correct.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Among the options, only **Option C** is correct. The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \), consistent with the commutation relations in angular momentum theory.

**Answer: C**
