Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a two-part reaction, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. I should draw its structure. Cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl). Wait, wait. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's both an ethyl and a methyl substituent, and at position 6, another methyl. So, positions 2, 6, and 1 have substituents. Wait, maybe I should number the ring correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 2, 6, and 1? No, the ketone is at position 1. So the substituents are at 2 (ethyl and methyl?) Or wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone is at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Position 6 has another methyl.

Wait, no. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents on the cyclohexane ring are at positions 2, 2, and 6. So there's an ethyl group and a methyl group both at position 2, and a methyl at position 6. So the ring has the ketone (O) at position 1, two methyl groups and an ethyl at position 2, and a methyl at position 6. So the structure would look like a cyclohexane ring with the ketone at C1, and at C2, a branch with ethyl and methyl, and at C6, another methyl.

Now, the reaction is with ethyl acrylate (which is CH2=CHCOOEt) and t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. So, what kind of reaction is this? It sounds like a Michael addition or maybe a conjugate addition. Alternatively, since it's a ketone and an acrylate, perhaps it's a Claisen or similar condensation reaction.

Wait, but for cyclohexanone derivatives, when treated with a base like t-BuOK, perhaps an enolate is formed. The acrylate (ethyl acrylate) is an electron-deficient species, so maybe it undergoes a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate, which then attacks the acrylate. Since acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, it's a good Michael acceptor. So the enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, no. Wait, the enolate is a nucleophile. The acrylate has a conjugated system, so the enolate would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester in a Michael addition. So the enolate (from the ketone) would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, this could be a case of a Diels-Alder reaction if the acrylate is acting as a dienophile. But wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. The starting material has a ketone, but perhaps the cyclohexanone is acting as a dienophile? Hmm, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach. The starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the other is an acrylate. The reaction conditions are t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. So likely, it's a Michael addition. So the enolate of the ketone would attack the acrylate.

The enolate will form from the ketone. The ketone is at position 1. The cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 2, 2 (ethyl and methyl), and 6. So the substituents at 2 and 6 are bulky. So when the base abstracts a proton to form the enolate, it will do so at the most acidic alpha position, which is the one most substituted. Wait, but bulky groups can influence where the enolate forms because of steric hindrance.

In a cyclohexanone, the alpha positions are adjacent to the ketone. So positions 2 and 6 are alpha carbons (since the ketone is at position 1). So, the ketone is at C1, so C2 and C6 are adjacent and thus potentially alpha.

Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So the substituents are at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). The ketone is at C1.

So, the possible alpha hydrogens are at C2 and C6. But C2 has two substituents (ethyl and methyl), making it more substituted than C6, which has only a methyl. So, when the base deprotonates, which alpha position is more favorable? The more substituted position is more likely to form the enolate because the transition state is more stabilized (more substituted double bonds are more stable). But wait, in this case, the substituents are in a ring, so steric factors might come into play.

Wait, the base t-BuOK is bulky, so it would prefer to abstract the less hindered proton. So where is the less hindered alpha hydrogen? If C2 has a lot of substituents (ethyl and methyl), perhaps the hydrogen on C6 is less hindered. So the base would abstract the hydrogen at C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, wait. Let me imagine the structure. The cyclohexane ring has the ketone (O) at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached. C6 has a methyl group. So, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has more substituents, so it's more hindered. So in a bulky base scenario, the base would abstract the hydrogen from the less hindered position, which is C6. So the enolate would form at C6, giving a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but in a cyclohexanone, the ring is six-membered. So the positions are C1 (ketone), C2 (ethyl and methyl), C3 (CH2?), C4 (CH2?), C5 (CH2?), C6 (methyl).

Wait, perhaps the ring is substituted like this: positions 1 (ketone), 2 (ethyl and methyl), and 6 (methyl). So the ring would have substituents at 1, 2, and 6.

When the enolate forms, the base would abstract a proton alpha to the ketone. So the alpha positions are C2 and C6. Now, C2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl groups, which are bulky. So if the base is bulky, it would more likely abstract the proton from C6, which is less hindered.

So the enolate would form between C1 and C6, making the double bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but that's adjacent to the ketone. Wait no, the enolate would be between C6 and C1 because the ketone is at C1. Wait, no, the enolate forms by deprotonation at an alpha carbon and the formation of a double bond with the carbonyl carbon. So the enolate would have a double bond between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6.

Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. The cyclohexanone has the carbonyl at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So when the base deprotonates C2 or C6, the enolate forms a double bond between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6.

If the base abstracts the proton from C2, then the double bond would be C1-C2, making an enolate like O=C-C2-CH2... but wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

In the ketone, the carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. The base t-BuOK would abstract a proton from either C2 or C6.

If the enolate forms at C2 (which is more substituted), it might be more stabilized because of conjugation, but the bulky base might prefer the less substituted site. So I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, another approach: the formation of the enolate favors the less hindered site when the base is bulky. So in this case, the C6 position is less substituted (only a methyl group), while C2 is substituted with ethyl and methyl. So the base would abstract the hydrogen from C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.

So then, in the enolate, the negative charge would be on C6. The enolate would attack the acrylate.

Ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The structure is CH2=CHCOOEt. The enolate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 in CH2=CHCOOEt). So the attack would happen at the beta position, adding the enolate's carbon to the acrylate.

Wait, no. The Michael addition involves the enolate attacking the beta carbon of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (acrylate here). So the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, forming a new bond.

So the product would have a new carbon chain attached to the cyclohexanone ring.

In terms of structure, after the addition, the cyclohexanone ring would have a substituent at C6 (from the enolate) which is connected to the CH2 group (from the acrylate attack). So perhaps the product would be a cyclohexyl group attached to a propanoate ester.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. The cyclohexanone would have the enolate at C6, adding to the acrylate's beta carbon. So the cyclohexane ring's C6 is connected via a single bond to the CH2, which is part of the acrylate-derived group.

So the product would be an ethyl ester of a propanoate, with the cyclohexyl group attached.

Looking at the options, each option gives A as a certain substituent. For option B, A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

Wait, so in the product, the cyclohexane ring would have a ketone (oxo group) at a certain position, and substituents at 3, 5, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think about where the addition occurs. The enolate is formed at C6. When it attacks the acrylate, it adds two carbons (from the acrylate's CH2CHCOOEt part) to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2), the CH2 would become connected to the enolate's C6, and the CH would be attached to the COOEt.

So the product would be a cyclohexane ring with substituents at C6 (from the enolate), which is now connected to a CH2CHCOOEt group. But wait, the enolate is at C6, so the attack would add a CH2CHCOOEt group to C6.

Wait, or perhaps the attack leads to the formation of a new carbon chain. Let me think: the enolate (from C6) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate (the CH2), so the enolate's C6 becomes connected to the CH2 group of the acrylate. Then, the alpha carbon (the CH of the acrylate) would become connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps after the attack, the structure would have the cyclohexyl group connected via a single bond to a CH2, which is connected to a CH, which is connected to the carbonyl group (COOEt). So the product would have a propanoate ester attached to the cyclohexane ring at C6.

But then, considering the ring's substituents, the cyclohexane ring has the ketone at C1, and substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl and now the propanoate group).

Wait, but the product's options have substituents at 3-ethyl, 3,5-dimethyl, etc. So perhaps the ring has substituents at different positions.

I'm getting a bit stuck on visualizing the product. Let me think about the possible structures in the options.

Option B for product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. So the substituents on the cyclohexyl group are at positions 3 (ethyl and methyl), 3 and 5 (methyl), and position 4 has the ketone.

Wait, but the starting material has the ketone at position 1. So after the reaction, the ketone might shift position, or perhaps another is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a new ketone being formed elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the addition of the enolate and acrylate leads to the formation of a new six-membered ring or a new substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a Michael addition but a Claisen-like condensation. Let me think. The enolate could attack the electrophilic position of the acrylate, leading to a new ring formation.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the cyclohexanone (as a dienophile?) and the acrylate (as a dienophile?), but I'm not sure if that applies here. Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile, and the conditions usually involve heat or Lewis acids. Here, t-BuOK is a base, so perhaps that's not it.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition), where the enolate attacks the acrylate. The enolate is from the cyclohexanone, which is a good nucleophile, and the acrylate is a good Michael acceptor.

So the product would be a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2CHCOOEt group. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the product after the Michael addition would have the cyclohexyl group attached to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the new structure would have the cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-COOEt group. Wait, but the starting acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So when the enolate attacks the beta position (the CH2 in CH2=CHCOOEt), the resulting structure would have CH2 connected to the cyclohexyl and the other CH connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-COOEt, but that doesn't seem to match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the addition leads to a ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options for product A:

Option A: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

So the cyclohexyl group has substituents at 3 (ethyl and methyl), 1 and 3 (methyl), and a ketone at 2.

Option B: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. So substituents at 3 (ethyl and methyl), 3 and 5 (methyl), ketone at 4.

So in these options, the position of the ketone has changed from 1 to 2 or 4. That suggests that a ring-opening or some rearrangement might have occurred, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition followed by a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the enolate adds to the acrylate, forming a new substituent, but the ring remains intact. Let me think about the positions. The enolate adds to the acrylate, which is a three-carbon group (CH2-CH2-COOEt?), no, it's CH2=CH-COOEt. So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2), it would form a new bond between the enolate's carbon (C6) and the CH2 of the acrylate. Then, the structure would have the cyclohexane ring with a CH2-CH-COOEt group attached at C6.

But that would make the product ethyl something propanoate, as seen in the options.

Wait, considering the structure, the product would have a propanoate group attached to the cyclohexane ring. The chain would be CH2-CH-COOEt, but the CH2 is connected to the cyclohexane.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the reaction forms a new ketone. The enolate attacks the acrylate, leading to the addition of a new group and then perhaps a proton shift or some tautomerism.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of aldol addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new cyclohexene ring with substituents. But I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about the second reaction quickly to see if that gives me any clues.

The second reaction is 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and H2O. Hmm, 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2? Wait, no. Wait, propane has three carbons. 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, nitro groups are at the first carbon? Wait, 1-nitropropane would be CH2CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, propane is CH3CH2CH3. The nitro group would be on the first carbon, so it's CH2CH2CH3 with the nitro on the first carbon. Wait, no, 1-nitropropane would be CH2=CHCH2NO2? No, no, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2. Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2NO2)2? Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. No, I think more accurately, propane has three carbons, so 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. But that doesn't make sense because the nitro group is on the first carbon (CH2NO2-CH2CH3? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that would be more like 1-nitropropane.

But perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2NO2? No, that's 3-nitropropene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the reaction conditions are KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water.

Wait, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2CHCH2CN, but in E configuration. So it's CH2CH2CN with a double bond, specifically CH2=CHCN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CHCH2CN but with double bond at 2, so it's CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2CHCH2CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but the formula is CH2=CHCH2CN. So it's (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which would have the CN on one end and a CH2 on the other, with the double bond in the middle.

So the reaction is between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water.

Hmm, what kind of reaction is this? Maybe a nucleophilic substitution or perhaps a nitrile addition.

Wait, 1-nitropropane is a nitroalkane. Nitroalkanes can undergo various substitution reactions, especially under basic conditions. In the presence of a base like KOH, perhaps the nitro group is a good leaving group if activated. Wait, nitro groups are typically not good leaving groups, but under strong basic conditions, maybe a substitution occurs.

Alternatively, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile could act as a nucleophile. Wait, nitriles are generally not great nucleophiles, but under certain conditions, especially with strong bases, they might deprotonate or participate in some way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a conjugate addition of the nitrile to the nitropropane. But nitropropane is not an alpha,beta-unsaturated compound. Or maybe it's an example of a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile.

Wait, but nitro groups are not good leaving groups. However, in the presence of a base and a good nucleophile, perhaps some kind of elimination or substitution occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced in some way, but the reagents don't seem to suggest that. The presence of KOH, water, and a nitrile.

Wait, another possibility is that the nitropropane undergoes hydrolysis under basic conditions. Nitroalkanes can hydrolyze to form ketones or other products. Wait, but under basic conditions, 1-nitropropane would typically hydrolyze to form a ketone. For example, RNO2 + H2O → RCOOH or RCOO−, depending on conditions.

Wait, 1-nitropropane (CH2CH2CH2NO2) hydrolyzing in basic conditions would form CH2CH2COO−. But wait, how does that connect to the but-2-enenitrile?

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a base or a nucleophile here. Wait, perhaps the nitro group is being substituted by the nitrile group. So the nitrile would attack where the nitro group was, leading to a substitution.

But substitution of a nitro group with a nitrile would require a good leaving group, and nitro is not a leaving group. So maybe this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is a leaving group. But again, nitro groups are poor leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction or some conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing some kind of addition reaction. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is an alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile. So maybe it's acting as a Michael donor or acceptor.

Wait, maybe the nitropropane is undergoing a substitution where the nitrile group attacks. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile. So 1-nitropropane (CH2CH2CH2NO2) reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile to form CH2CH2CH2CN, but that doesn't seem right because the nitrile would have to come in from the other end.

Wait, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a base, abstracting a proton from 1-nitropropane, leading to an elimination. But then what? The product would be an alkene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is acting as a nucleophile in an SN2 reaction, but the nitro group isn't a good leaving group. So maybe the nitro group is converted into a better leaving group first. But under the given conditions (KOH, water), perhaps the nitro group is converted into a nitroso or something else.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the second reaction. Let me try to think about possible products.

Looking at the options for product B: options A and B have B as 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. Option C and D have B as either 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile or 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.

Wait, the starting material for B is 1-nitropropane. After reaction, the product would have a nitrile group added somewhere. If the product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, that suggests that the nitro group remains and a nitrile is added at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an addition of the nitrile group to the nitropropane, leading to a substitution or an extended chain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile.

1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. If the nitro group is replaced by a nitrile, you would get CH2CH2CH2CN. But that's 1-cyanopropane, which is not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is added to the chain, increasing the carbon count.

Wait, another possibility: the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing some kind of addition to the nitropropane. For example, the nitropropane could act as a nucleophile, attacking the nitrile's carbon. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, such as a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile acts as a base. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing hydrolysis under the basic conditions to form a carboxylic acid or its conjugate base, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is reduced to an amine, but that doesn't fit with the reagents given.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each step again.

First reaction: enolate addition to acrylate.

Second reaction: substitution or addition involving nitropropane and but-2-enenitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is a conjugate addition. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile. So perhaps the nitropropane is acting as a nucleophile, adding to the alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile in a conjugate fashion.

Wait, but nitropropane is not a strong nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps under basic conditions, the nitrile is deprotonated, making it a better nucleophile. Or maybe the but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the nitropropane is the nucleophile.

Wait, but nitropropane isn't a strong enough nucleophile for that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile. But under basic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylates. For example, RCN + H2O under acidic or basic conditions gives RCOOH or RCOO−.

Wait, but the presence of KOH and water might lead to the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylate. Let me think. (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH2CHCH2CN) on hydrolysis would give CH2CHCH2COOH, which is 3-cyanopropanoic acid? Wait, no, hydrolysis of nitriles typically produces carboxylic acids. So (E)-but-2-enenitrile would hydrolyze to 2-enanoic acid? Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, so hydrolysis would give CH2=CHCH2COOH, which is 3-cyano... Wait, no, the nitrile is at the end. So hydrolysis would give CH2=CHCH2COOH, which is 3-enoic acid or something like that.

But I'm not sure how that connects with 1-nitropropane.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the hydroxyl group from the water. But that would lead to a diol or something else, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitropropane is undergoing some kind of elimination to form an alkene, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nitro group being replaced by the nitrile group via some kind of substitution. But as I said, nitro groups aren't good leaving groups, but maybe under strong basic conditions, something can happen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a base, abstracting a proton from 1-nitropropane, leading to an elimination of the nitro group and formation of a double bond. Then, maybe an addition of the nitrile occurs.

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the nitropropane and nitrile combine to form a longer chain with both nitro and nitrile groups.

Wait, the product option B in option A is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2NO2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons. 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile would be CH2(CN)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-NO2? Hmm, not exactly sure.

Alternatively, it's CH2CH2CN with substituents. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible structures.

But let's go back to the first reaction. Maybe I should make a better analysis.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. The major product is A.

t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it tends to form the less substituted enolate via the less hindered alpha hydrogen. So in the starting material, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has more substituents (ethyl and methyl), so the less hindered site is C6. So the base will abstract a proton from C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.

Then, the enolate will attack the acrylate's beta carbon (CH2 in CH2=CHCOOEt). The attack forms a new bond between C6 and the CH2. The product would have a new substituent on the ring at C6, which is connected to CH2-CH-COOEt.

So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, methyl groups at C2 and C6, an ethyl group at C2, and a new substituent at C6 which is CH2CHCOOEt.

Wait, but looking at the options, the substituents are at different positions. For example, option B's A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

So the substituents are at positions 3 (ethyl and methyl), 3 and 5 (methyl), and the ketone at position 4.

Wait, perhaps after the addition, the ring undergoes some kind of ring-opening or shift, leading to the ketone moving to a different position. Alternatively, the addition could lead to a ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking about the enolate attack incorrectly. Maybe the enolate attacks the acrylate, leading to the formation of a new ring. Or perhaps the addition leads to a new substituent that causes the ring to shift.

Wait, another possibility: the enolate adds to the acrylate, and then the ring undergoes a hydride shift or some rearrangement, leading to a more stable carbocation or enol. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound. But the options don't seem to indicate that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diastereomers or the stability of the product. The enolate attack would lead to the formation of a new substituent that's less hindered, so perhaps the product has the substituents in positions that minimize steric hindrance.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new ketone after the addition. For example, the addition could form a new double bond, which could then undergo a keto-enol tautomerism, leading to a new ketone position.

Wait, perhaps after the attack, the structure would have a new substituent, and upon protonation, a new ketone is formed. So the initial addition would create a new carbon chain attached to the ring, and then a hydride shift could move the ketone.

Wait, for example, the addition could lead to a structure where the ring has a substituent connected to a CH2CHCOOEt group. Then, a hydride shift from the adjacent carbon could form a new ketone, leading to a more stable structure.

In that case, the ketone might move from position 1 to another position, like position 4 or 2, depending on where the addition occurs.

Looking at the options, option B's A has a ketone at position 4. So perhaps the addition leads to a shift of the ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction forms a new six-membered ring via a Claisen-like rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Well, perhaps I should proceed to the second reaction.

The second reaction is 1-nitropropane + KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O → B.

Given the options for B, it's either 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile or 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.

Given that the starting material is 1-nitropropane (which has three carbons), and the reagent is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (four carbons?), the product B would have more carbons than the starting material.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile has four carbons, so perhaps the product is formed by some kind of alkylation, where the nitrile group is attached to the nitropropane.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile group. But that would require the nitro group to leave, which it doesn't usually do.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is added to the nitropropane via a substitution or addition reaction, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction with the nitropropane as a diene. But nitropropane isn't a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitropropane, which then undergoes some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitropropane is hydrolyzing to a ketone, and then the nitrile is adding to that.

Wait, let me think. 1-nitropropane in the presence of KOH and water might hydrolyze. The hydrolysis of nitroalkanes typically gives ketones. For example, 1-nitropropane would hydrolyze to acetone (propan-2-one). Because when a nitro group is at the end of a chain (primary), hydrolysis gives a ketone by removing two carbons. Wait, no, wait: 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. Wait, actually, I think 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2, which upon hydrolysis would give CH3COOH (acetic acid), because the nitro group is at the end.

Wait, no: the structure of 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2, which is a primary nitroalkane. Hydrolysis of primary nitroalkanes typically yields carboxylic acids. So 1-nitropropane would hydrolyze to propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH and H2O are causing the nitropropane to hydrolyze into a ketone. Wait, primary nitroalkanes hydrolyze to form carboxylic acids, secondary to ketones, tertiary to alcohols.

So 1-nitropropane is a primary nitroalkane, so it would hydrolyze to propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH). But the reaction conditions are with (E)-but-2-enenitrile, KOH, and H2O.

Hmm. If the nitropropane hydrolyzes to propanoic acid, and the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is present, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing some reaction with the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid as well, but that would require acidic conditions, and the reaction is under basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing addition with the propanoic acid.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing a substitution with the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile acts as a nucleophile, attacking the nitropropane. But again, nitro groups are poor leaving groups.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the options suggest for product B.

Option A and B have B as 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2CN-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-NO2, but that doesn't seem right because the nitro group is at position 4 in butane, which would be the end. So it's butanenitrile with substituents.

Wait, but butane has four carbons. So 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile would be:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2NO2-CN? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2CH2CN with substituents. Wait, maybe the structure is:

NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-NO2

No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CN, but with a nitro group on the fourth carbon. Wait, but that would be a five-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-NO2

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile group.

Wait, if the product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, then the molecule has a nitrile group and a nitro group. That suggests that the reaction is adding a nitrile group without removing the nitro group. So perhaps the nitrile is added to the nitropropane.

But how? Maybe via a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by a nitrile group. But that would require the nitro group to be a good leaving group, which it's not.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, where the nitropropane and nitrile combine to form a molecule with both groups. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Another approach: perhaps the nitrile is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitropropane, leading to some elimination, but I don't see how that would form the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a nucleophilic attack by the nitrile on the nitropropane, but again, I'm not sure.

Well, I think I'm stuck on the second reaction, but perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the options.

If the product B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, it suggests that the nitro group is retained, and a nitrile group is added to the same molecule. So perhaps the nitrile is added as a substituent.

But how? Maybe the reaction is a substitution where the nitrile replaces a hydrogen on the nitropropane, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing a conjugate addition to the nitropropane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile group attacks the 1-nitropropane, replacing the nitro group.

Wait, but that would require the nitro group to leave, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps under basic conditions, the nitro group is deprotonated, making it a better leaving group.

Wait, but nitro groups don't have hydrogens attached. Nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. The nitro group is NO2 attached to the end carbon. So the molecule is CH2CH2CH2NO2.

So in that case, the nitro group is on the end, and perhaps the nitrile could substitute it. But that would require a good leaving group, which the nitro isn't.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling where the nitrile group is added to the chain, making a longer molecule with both groups.

If the product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, which has four carbons, the original nitropropane is three carbons, and the but-2-enenitrile is four. So perhaps the nitrile is added to the nitropropane, making a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitrile adds a carbon to the chain. For example, the nitrile might act as a base, abstracting a proton adjacent to the nitro group, leading to elimination of the nitro group and formation of a double bond, followed by addition of the nitrile.

But I'm not confident about this.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to think about the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at option B: A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.

For product A, the substituents are at 3 (ethyl and methyl), 3 and 5 (methyl), and the ketone is at 4. How would that structure form from the starting material?

The starting material has substituents at 1 (ketone), 2 (ethyl and methyl), and 6 (methyl). After the reaction, the ketone moves to position 4, and new substituents are at 3 and 5.

This suggests a ring expansion or a shift in the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a new substituent that causes the ring to reorganize.

Alternatively, maybe the enolate attack leads to the addition of a propanoate group in such a way that the ketone shifts.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the correct answer is option B, where product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, and product B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.

As for the second reaction, I'll have to make a guess. Product B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.

So, looking at the options, option B has A as that structure and B as that product.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The first reaction involves 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. t-BuOK, being a strong and bulky base, deprotonates the less hindered alpha position of the ketone. In this case, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is more substituted (with an ethyl and methyl group), so the base abstracts a proton from C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6. This enolate attacks the beta carbon (CH2) of ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOEt), leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 4, methyl groups at positions 3 and 5, an ethyl group at position 3, and a propanoate ester substituent at position 3. This corresponds to ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, KOH, and H2O. The product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. This suggests that the reaction involves the retention of the nitro group and the addition of a nitrile group to the chain. The exact mechanism is unclear, but the product structure indicates that the nitrile group is added to the molecule without removing the nitro group.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

**A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.**

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a two-part reaction, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. I should draw its structure. Cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl). Wait, wait. Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So, the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's both an ethyl and a methyl substituent, and at position 6, another methyl. So, positions 2, 6, and 1 have substituents. Wait, maybe I should number the ring correctly.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 2, 6, and 1? No, the ketone is at position 1. So the substituents are at 2 (ethyl and methyl?) Or wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexanone is at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. Position 6 has another methyl.

Wait, no. Wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the substituents on the cyclohexane ring are at positions 2, 2, and 6. So there's an ethyl group and a methyl group both at position 2, and a methyl at position 6. So the ring has the ketone (O) at position 1, two methyl groups and an ethyl at position 2, and a methyl at position 6. So the structure would look like a cyclohexane ring with the ketone at C1, and at C2, a branch with ethyl and methyl, and at C6, another methyl.

Now, the reaction is with ethyl acrylate (which is CH2=CHCOOEt) and t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. So, what kind of reaction is this? It sounds like a Michael addition or maybe a conjugate addition. Alternatively, since it's a ketone and an acrylate, perhaps it's a Claisen or similar condensation reaction.

Wait, but for cyclohexanone derivatives, when treated with a base like t-BuOK, perhaps an enolate is formed. The acrylate (ethyl acrylate) is an electron-deficient species, so maybe it undergoes a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate, which then attacks the acrylate. Since acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, it's a good Michael acceptor. So the enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, no. Wait, the enolate is a nucleophile. The acrylate has a conjugated system, so the enolate would attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester in a Michael addition. So the enolate (from the ketone) would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate, leading to a new carbon-carbon bond.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, this could be a case of a Diels-Alder reaction if the acrylate is acting as a dienophile. But wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. The starting material has a ketone, but perhaps the cyclohexanone is acting as a dienophile? Hmm, I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another approach. The starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the other is an acrylate. The reaction conditions are t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base. So likely, it's a Michael addition. So the enolate of the ketone would attack the acrylate.

The enolate will form from the ketone. The ketone is at position 1. The cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 2, 2 (ethyl and methyl), and 6. So the substituents at 2 and 6 are bulky. So when the base abstracts a proton to form the enolate, it will do so at the most acidic alpha position, which is the one most substituted. Wait, but bulky groups can influence where the enolate forms because of steric hindrance.

In a cyclohexanone, the alpha positions are adjacent to the ketone. So positions 2 and 6 are alpha carbons (since the ketone is at position 1). So, the ketone is at C1, so C2 and C6 are adjacent and thus potentially alpha.

Wait, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. So the substituents are at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). The ketone is at C1.

So, the possible alpha hydrogens are at C2 and C6. But C2 has two substituents (ethyl and methyl), making it more substituted than C6, which has only a methyl. So, when the base deprotonates, which alpha position is more favorable? The more substituted position is more likely to form the enolate because the transition state is more stabilized (more substituted double bonds are more stable). But wait, in this case, the substituents are in a ring, so steric factors might come into play.

Wait, the base t-BuOK is bulky, so it would prefer to abstract the less hindered proton. So where is the less hindered alpha hydrogen? If C2 has a lot of substituents (ethyl and methyl), perhaps the hydrogen on C6 is less hindered. So the base would abstract the hydrogen at C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, wait. Let me imagine the structure. The cyclohexane ring has the ketone (O) at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group attached. C6 has a methyl group. So, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has more substituents, so it's more hindered. So in a bulky base scenario, the base would abstract the hydrogen from the less hindered position, which is C6. So the enolate would form at C6, giving a double bond between C1 and C6.

Wait, but in a cyclohexanone, the ring is six-membered. So the positions are C1 (ketone), C2 (ethyl and methyl), C3 (CH2?), C4 (CH2?), C5 (CH2?), C6 (methyl).

Wait, perhaps the ring is substituted like this: positions 1 (ketone), 2 (ethyl and methyl), and 6 (methyl). So the ring would have substituents at 1, 2, and 6.

When the enolate forms, the base would abstract a proton alpha to the ketone. So the alpha positions are C2 and C6. Now, C2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl groups, which are bulky. So if the base is bulky, it would more likely abstract the proton from C6, which is less hindered.

So the enolate would form between C1 and C6, making the double bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but that's adjacent to the ketone. Wait no, the enolate would be between C6 and C1 because the ketone is at C1. Wait, no, the enolate forms by deprotonation at an alpha carbon and the formation of a double bond with the carbonyl carbon. So the enolate would have a double bond between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6.

Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. The cyclohexanone has the carbonyl at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So when the base deprotonates C2 or C6, the enolate forms a double bond between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6.

If the base abstracts the proton from C2, then the double bond would be C1-C2, making an enolate like O=C-C2-CH2... but wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

In the ketone, the carbonyl is at C1. The adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. The base t-BuOK would abstract a proton from either C2 or C6.

If the enolate forms at C2 (which is more substituted), it might be more stabilized because of conjugation, but the bulky base might prefer the less substituted site. So I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, another approach: the formation of the enolate favors the less hindered site when the base is bulky. So in this case, the C6 position is less substituted (only a methyl group), while C2 is substituted with ethyl and methyl. So the base would abstract the hydrogen from C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.

So then, in the enolate, the negative charge would be on C6. The enolate would attack the acrylate.

Ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. The structure is CH2=CHCOOEt. The enolate would attack the beta carbon (the CH2 in CH2=CHCOOEt). So the attack would happen at the beta position, adding the enolate's carbon to the acrylate.

Wait, no. The Michael addition involves the enolate attacking the beta carbon of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (acrylate here). So the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, forming a new bond.

So the product would have a new carbon chain attached to the cyclohexanone ring.

In terms of structure, after the addition, the cyclohexanone ring would have a substituent at C6 (from the enolate) which is connected to the CH2 group (from the acrylate attack). So perhaps the product would be a cyclohexyl group attached to a propanoate ester.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. The cyclohexanone would have the enolate at C6, adding to the acrylate's beta carbon. So the cyclohexane ring's C6 is connected via a single bond to the CH2, which is part of the acrylate-derived group.

So the product would be an ethyl ester of a propanoate, with the cyclohexyl group attached.

Looking at the options, each option gives A as a certain substituent. For option B, A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

Wait, so in the product, the cyclohexane ring would have a ketone (oxo group) at a certain position, and substituents at 3, 5, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think about where the addition occurs. The enolate is formed at C6. When it attacks the acrylate, it adds two carbons (from the acrylate's CH2CHCOOEt part) to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2), the CH2 would become connected to the enolate's C6, and the CH would be attached to the COOEt.

So the product would be a cyclohexane ring with substituents at C6 (from the enolate), which is now connected to a CH2CHCOOEt group. But wait, the enolate is at C6, so the attack would add a CH2CHCOOEt group to C6.

Wait, or perhaps the attack leads to the formation of a new carbon chain. Let me think: the enolate (from C6) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate (the CH2), so the enolate's C6 becomes connected to the CH2 group of the acrylate. Then, the alpha carbon (the CH of the acrylate) would become connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps after the attack, the structure would have the cyclohexyl group connected via a single bond to a CH2, which is connected to a CH, which is connected to the carbonyl group (COOEt). So the product would have a propanoate ester attached to the cyclohexane ring at C6.

But then, considering the ring's substituents, the cyclohexane ring has the ketone at C1, and substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl and now the propanoate group).

Wait, but the product's options have substituents at 3-ethyl, 3,5-dimethyl, etc. So perhaps the ring has substituents at different positions.

I'm getting a bit stuck on visualizing the product. Let me think about the possible structures in the options.

Option B for product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. So the substituents on the cyclohexyl group are at positions 3 (ethyl and methyl), 3 and 5 (methyl), and position 4 has the ketone.

Wait, but the starting material has the ketone at position 1. So after the reaction, the ketone might shift position, or perhaps another is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to a new ketone being formed elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the addition of the enolate and acrylate leads to the formation of a new six-membered ring or a new substituent.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't a Michael addition but a Claisen-like condensation. Let me think. The enolate could attack the electrophilic position of the acrylate, leading to a new ring formation.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the cyclohexanone (as a dienophile?) and the acrylate (as a dienophile?), but I'm not sure if that applies here. Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile, and the conditions usually involve heat or Lewis acids. Here, t-BuOK is a base, so perhaps that's not it.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition), where the enolate attacks the acrylate. The enolate is from the cyclohexanone, which is a good nucleophile, and the acrylate is a good Michael acceptor.

So the product would be a cyclohexyl group connected via a CH2CHCOOEt group. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the product after the Michael addition would have the cyclohexyl group attached to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the new structure would have the cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-COOEt group. Wait, but the starting acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So when the enolate attacks the beta position (the CH2 in CH2=CHCOOEt), the resulting structure would have CH2 connected to the cyclohexyl and the other CH connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-COOEt, but that doesn't seem to match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the addition leads to a ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at the options for product A:

Option A: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-1,3-dimethyl-2-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

So the cyclohexyl group has substituents at 3 (ethyl and methyl), 1 and 3 (methyl), and a ketone at 2.

Option B: ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate. So substituents at 3 (ethyl and methyl), 3 and 5 (methyl), ketone at 4.

So in these options, the position of the ketone has changed from 1 to 2 or 4. That suggests that a ring-opening or some rearrangement might have occurred, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition followed by a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, maybe the enolate adds to the acrylate, forming a new substituent, but the ring remains intact. Let me think about the positions. The enolate adds to the acrylate, which is a three-carbon group (CH2-CH2-COOEt?), no, it's CH2=CH-COOEt. So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2), it would form a new bond between the enolate's carbon (C6) and the CH2 of the acrylate. Then, the structure would have the cyclohexane ring with a CH2-CH-COOEt group attached at C6.

But that would make the product ethyl something propanoate, as seen in the options.

Wait, considering the structure, the product would have a propanoate group attached to the cyclohexane ring. The chain would be CH2-CH-COOEt, but the CH2 is connected to the cyclohexane.

Hmm. Another approach: perhaps the reaction forms a new ketone. The enolate attacks the acrylate, leading to the addition of a new group and then perhaps a proton shift or some tautomerism.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gamma,delta-unsaturated ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of aldol addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new cyclohexene ring with substituents. But I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about the second reaction quickly to see if that gives me any clues.

The second reaction is 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and H2O. Hmm, 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2? Wait, no. Wait, propane has three carbons. 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, nitro groups are at the first carbon? Wait, 1-nitropropane would be CH2CH2CH2NO2? No, wait, propane is CH3CH2CH3. The nitro group would be on the first carbon, so it's CH2CH2CH3 with the nitro on the first carbon. Wait, no, 1-nitropropane would be CH2=CHCH2NO2? No, no, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2. Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2NO2)2? Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. No, I think more accurately, propane has three carbons, so 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. But that doesn't make sense because the nitro group is on the first carbon (CH2NO2-CH2CH3? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH2NO2, but that would be more like 1-nitropropane.

But perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2NO2? No, that's 3-nitropropene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the reaction conditions are KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water.

Wait, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is CH2CHCH2CN, but in E configuration. So it's CH2CH2CN with a double bond, specifically CH2=CHCN? No, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CHCH2CN but with double bond at 2, so it's CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2CHCH2CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but the formula is CH2=CHCH2CN. So it's (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which would have the CN on one end and a CH2 on the other, with the double bond in the middle.

So the reaction is between 1-nitropropane and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of KOH and water.

Hmm, what kind of reaction is this? Maybe a nucleophilic substitution or perhaps a nitrile addition.

Wait, 1-nitropropane is a nitroalkane. Nitroalkanes can undergo various substitution reactions, especially under basic conditions. In the presence of a base like KOH, perhaps the nitro group is a good leaving group if activated. Wait, nitro groups are typically not good leaving groups, but under strong basic conditions, maybe a substitution occurs.

Alternatively, the (E)-but-2-enenitrile could act as a nucleophile. Wait, nitriles are generally not great nucleophiles, but under certain conditions, especially with strong bases, they might deprotonate or participate in some way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a conjugate addition of the nitrile to the nitropropane. But nitropropane is not an alpha,beta-unsaturated compound. Or maybe it's an example of a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile.

Wait, but nitro groups are not good leaving groups. However, in the presence of a base and a good nucleophile, perhaps some kind of elimination or substitution occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is reduced in some way, but the reagents don't seem to suggest that. The presence of KOH, water, and a nitrile.

Wait, another possibility is that the nitropropane undergoes hydrolysis under basic conditions. Nitroalkanes can hydrolyze to form ketones or other products. Wait, but under basic conditions, 1-nitropropane would typically hydrolyze to form a ketone. For example, RNO2 + H2O → RCOOH or RCOO−, depending on conditions.

Wait, 1-nitropropane (CH2CH2CH2NO2) hydrolyzing in basic conditions would form CH2CH2COO−. But wait, how does that connect to the but-2-enenitrile?

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a base or a nucleophile here. Wait, perhaps the nitro group is being substituted by the nitrile group. So the nitrile would attack where the nitro group was, leading to a substitution.

But substitution of a nitro group with a nitrile would require a good leaving group, and nitro is not a leaving group. So maybe this isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is a leaving group. But again, nitro groups are poor leaving groups. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction or some conjugate addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing some kind of addition reaction. Wait, but but-2-enenitrile is an alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile. So maybe it's acting as a Michael donor or acceptor.

Wait, maybe the nitropropane is undergoing a substitution where the nitrile group attacks. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile. So 1-nitropropane (CH2CH2CH2NO2) reacts with (E)-but-2-enenitrile to form CH2CH2CH2CN, but that doesn't seem right because the nitrile would have to come in from the other end.

Wait, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a base, abstracting a proton from 1-nitropropane, leading to an elimination. But then what? The product would be an alkene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is acting as a nucleophile in an SN2 reaction, but the nitro group isn't a good leaving group. So maybe the nitro group is converted into a better leaving group first. But under the given conditions (KOH, water), perhaps the nitro group is converted into a nitroso or something else.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on the second reaction. Let me try to think about possible products.

Looking at the options for product B: options A and B have B as 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. Option C and D have B as either 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile or 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.

Wait, the starting material for B is 1-nitropropane. After reaction, the product would have a nitrile group added somewhere. If the product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, that suggests that the nitro group remains and a nitrile is added at the end.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an addition of the nitrile group to the nitropropane, leading to a substitution or an extended chain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile.

1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. If the nitro group is replaced by a nitrile, you would get CH2CH2CH2CN. But that's 1-cyanopropane, which is not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is added to the chain, increasing the carbon count.

Wait, another possibility: the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing some kind of addition to the nitropropane. For example, the nitropropane could act as a nucleophile, attacking the nitrile's carbon. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, such as a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile acts as a base. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing hydrolysis under the basic conditions to form a carboxylic acid or its conjugate base, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is reduced to an amine, but that doesn't fit with the reagents given.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about each step again.

First reaction: enolate addition to acrylate.

Second reaction: substitution or addition involving nitropropane and but-2-enenitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is a conjugate addition. (E)-but-2-enenitrile is an alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile. So perhaps the nitropropane is acting as a nucleophile, adding to the alpha,beta-unsaturated nitrile in a conjugate fashion.

Wait, but nitropropane is not a strong nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps under basic conditions, the nitrile is deprotonated, making it a better nucleophile. Or maybe the but-2-enenitrile is the Michael acceptor, and the nitropropane is the nucleophile.

Wait, but nitropropane isn't a strong enough nucleophile for that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile. But under basic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylates. For example, RCN + H2O under acidic or basic conditions gives RCOOH or RCOO−.

Wait, but the presence of KOH and water might lead to the hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylate. Let me think. (E)-but-2-enenitrile (CH2CHCH2CN) on hydrolysis would give CH2CHCH2COOH, which is 3-cyanopropanoic acid? Wait, no, hydrolysis of nitriles typically produces carboxylic acids. So (E)-but-2-enenitrile would hydrolyze to 2-enanoic acid? Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CHCH2CN, so hydrolysis would give CH2=CHCH2COOH, which is 3-cyano... Wait, no, the nitrile is at the end. So hydrolysis would give CH2=CHCH2COOH, which is 3-enoic acid or something like that.

But I'm not sure how that connects with 1-nitropropane.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the hydroxyl group from the water. But that would lead to a diol or something else, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitropropane is undergoing some kind of elimination to form an alkene, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nitro group being replaced by the nitrile group via some kind of substitution. But as I said, nitro groups aren't good leaving groups, but maybe under strong basic conditions, something can happen.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a base, abstracting a proton from 1-nitropropane, leading to an elimination of the nitro group and formation of a double bond. Then, maybe an addition of the nitrile occurs.

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling where the nitropropane and nitrile combine to form a longer chain with both nitro and nitrile groups.

Wait, the product option B in option A is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2CH(CH3)CH(CH3)CH2NO2CN? No, wait, butane is four carbons. 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile would be CH2(CN)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-NO2? Hmm, not exactly sure.

Alternatively, it's CH2CH2CN with substituents. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible structures.

But let's go back to the first reaction. Maybe I should make a better analysis.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. The major product is A.

t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it tends to form the less substituted enolate via the less hindered alpha hydrogen. So in the starting material, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. C2 has more substituents (ethyl and methyl), so the less hindered site is C6. So the base will abstract a proton from C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6.

Then, the enolate will attack the acrylate's beta carbon (CH2 in CH2=CHCOOEt). The attack forms a new bond between C6 and the CH2. The product would have a new substituent on the ring at C6, which is connected to CH2-CH-COOEt.

So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, methyl groups at C2 and C6, an ethyl group at C2, and a new substituent at C6 which is CH2CHCOOEt.

Wait, but looking at the options, the substituents are at different positions. For example, option B's A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

So the substituents are at positions 3 (ethyl and methyl), 3 and 5 (methyl), and the ketone at position 4.

Wait, perhaps after the addition, the ring undergoes some kind of ring-opening or shift, leading to the ketone moving to a different position. Alternatively, the addition could lead to a ring expansion or contraction, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm thinking about the enolate attack incorrectly. Maybe the enolate attacks the acrylate, leading to the formation of a new ring. Or perhaps the addition leads to a new substituent that causes the ring to shift.

Wait, another possibility: the enolate adds to the acrylate, and then the ring undergoes a hydride shift or some rearrangement, leading to a more stable carbocation or enol. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound. But the options don't seem to indicate that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diastereomers or the stability of the product. The enolate attack would lead to the formation of a new substituent that's less hindered, so perhaps the product has the substituents in positions that minimize steric hindrance.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new ketone after the addition. For example, the addition could form a new double bond, which could then undergo a keto-enol tautomerism, leading to a new ketone position.

Wait, perhaps after the attack, the structure would have a new substituent, and upon protonation, a new ketone is formed. So the initial addition would create a new carbon chain attached to the ring, and then a hydride shift could move the ketone.

Wait, for example, the addition could lead to a structure where the ring has a substituent connected to a CH2CHCOOEt group. Then, a hydride shift from the adjacent carbon could form a new ketone, leading to a more stable structure.

In that case, the ketone might move from position 1 to another position, like position 4 or 2, depending on where the addition occurs.

Looking at the options, option B's A has a ketone at position 4. So perhaps the addition leads to a shift of the ketone.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction forms a new six-membered ring via a Claisen-like rearrangement. But I'm not certain.

Well, perhaps I should proceed to the second reaction.

The second reaction is 1-nitropropane + KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O → B.

Given the options for B, it's either 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile or 3-methyl-4-nitrohexanenitrile.

Given that the starting material is 1-nitropropane (which has three carbons), and the reagent is (E)-but-2-enenitrile (four carbons?), the product B would have more carbons than the starting material.

Wait, but but-2-enenitrile has four carbons, so perhaps the product is formed by some kind of alkylation, where the nitrile group is attached to the nitropropane.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile group. But that would require the nitro group to leave, which it doesn't usually do.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is added to the nitropropane via a substitution or addition reaction, leading to a longer chain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction with the nitropropane as a diene. But nitropropane isn't a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitropropane, which then undergoes some reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitropropane is hydrolyzing to a ketone, and then the nitrile is adding to that.

Wait, let me think. 1-nitropropane in the presence of KOH and water might hydrolyze. The hydrolysis of nitroalkanes typically gives ketones. For example, 1-nitropropane would hydrolyze to acetone (propan-2-one). Because when a nitro group is at the end of a chain (primary), hydrolysis gives a ketone by removing two carbons. Wait, no, wait: 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. Wait, actually, I think 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2, which upon hydrolysis would give CH3COOH (acetic acid), because the nitro group is at the end.

Wait, no: the structure of 1-nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2, which is a primary nitroalkane. Hydrolysis of primary nitroalkanes typically yields carboxylic acids. So 1-nitropropane would hydrolyze to propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH and H2O are causing the nitropropane to hydrolyze into a ketone. Wait, primary nitroalkanes hydrolyze to form carboxylic acids, secondary to ketones, tertiary to alcohols.

So 1-nitropropane is a primary nitroalkane, so it would hydrolyze to propanoic acid (CH2CH2COOH). But the reaction conditions are with (E)-but-2-enenitrile, KOH, and H2O.

Hmm. If the nitropropane hydrolyzes to propanoic acid, and the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is present, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing some reaction with the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid as well, but that would require acidic conditions, and the reaction is under basic conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing addition with the propanoic acid.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is undergoing a substitution with the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile acts as a nucleophile, attacking the nitropropane. But again, nitro groups are poor leaving groups.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the options suggest for product B.

Option A and B have B as 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2CN-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-NO2, but that doesn't seem right because the nitro group is at position 4 in butane, which would be the end. So it's butanenitrile with substituents.

Wait, but butane has four carbons. So 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile would be:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2NO2-CN? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2CH2CN with substituents. Wait, maybe the structure is:

NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-NO2

No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2CN, but with a nitro group on the fourth carbon. Wait, but that would be a five-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

NC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-NO2

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by the nitrile group.

Wait, if the product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, then the molecule has a nitrile group and a nitro group. That suggests that the reaction is adding a nitrile group without removing the nitro group. So perhaps the nitrile is added to the nitropropane.

But how? Maybe via a substitution where the nitro group is replaced by a nitrile group. But that would require the nitro group to be a good leaving group, which it's not.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling, where the nitropropane and nitrile combine to form a molecule with both groups. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Another approach: perhaps the nitrile is acting as a base, deprotonating the nitropropane, leading to some elimination, but I don't see how that would form the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves a nucleophilic attack by the nitrile on the nitropropane, but again, I'm not sure.

Well, I think I'm stuck on the second reaction, but perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the options.

If the product B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, it suggests that the nitro group is retained, and a nitrile group is added to the same molecule. So perhaps the nitrile is added as a substituent.

But how? Maybe the reaction is a substitution where the nitrile replaces a hydrogen on the nitropropane, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the (E)-but-2-enenitrile is undergoing a conjugate addition to the nitropropane, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the nitrile group attacks the 1-nitropropane, replacing the nitro group.

Wait, but that would require the nitro group to leave, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps under basic conditions, the nitro group is deprotonated, making it a better leaving group.

Wait, but nitro groups don't have hydrogens attached. Nitropropane is CH2CH2CH2NO2. The nitro group is NO2 attached to the end carbon. So the molecule is CH2CH2CH2NO2.

So in that case, the nitro group is on the end, and perhaps the nitrile could substitute it. But that would require a good leaving group, which the nitro isn't.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a coupling where the nitrile group is added to the chain, making a longer molecule with both groups.

If the product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile, which has four carbons, the original nitropropane is three carbons, and the but-2-enenitrile is four. So perhaps the nitrile is added to the nitropropane, making a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the nitrile adds a carbon to the chain. For example, the nitrile might act as a base, abstracting a proton adjacent to the nitro group, leading to elimination of the nitro group and formation of a double bond, followed by addition of the nitrile.

But I'm not confident about this.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to think about the options and see which makes sense.

Looking at option B: A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.

For product A, the substituents are at 3 (ethyl and methyl), 3 and 5 (methyl), and the ketone is at 4. How would that structure form from the starting material?

The starting material has substituents at 1 (ketone), 2 (ethyl and methyl), and 6 (methyl). After the reaction, the ketone moves to position 4, and new substituents are at 3 and 5.

This suggests a ring expansion or a shift in the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a new substituent that causes the ring to reorganize.

Alternatively, maybe the enolate attack leads to the addition of a propanoate group in such a way that the ketone shifts.

I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the correct answer is option B, where product A is ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, and product B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.

As for the second reaction, I'll have to make a guess. Product B is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.

So, looking at the options, option B has A as that structure and B as that product.


The first reaction involves 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. t-BuOK, being a strong and bulky base, deprotonates the less hindered alpha position of the ketone. In this case, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. C2 is more substituted (with an ethyl and methyl group), so the base abstracts a proton from C6, forming an enolate with the double bond between C1 and C6. This enolate attacks the beta carbon (CH2) of ethyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOEt), leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 4, methyl groups at positions 3 and 5, an ethyl group at position 3, and a propanoate ester substituent at position 3. This corresponds to ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate.

The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, KOH, and H2O. The product is 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile. This suggests that the reaction involves the retention of the nitro group and the addition of a nitrile group to the chain. The exact mechanism is unclear, but the product structure indicates that the nitrile group is added to the molecule without removing the nitro group.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

**A = ethyl 3-(3-ethyl-3,5-dimethyl-4-oxocyclohexyl)propanoate, B = 2,3-dimethyl-4-nitrobutanenitrile.**

Answer: B
