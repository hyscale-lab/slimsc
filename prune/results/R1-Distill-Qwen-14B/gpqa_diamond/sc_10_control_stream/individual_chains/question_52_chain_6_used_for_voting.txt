Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let's see. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain properties and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Alright, let's break it down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the spots are making the star cooler overall. 

The key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They say that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question asks by what factor the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, wait. So when the star is spotless, the Teff is higher (6000 K), and when it has spots, it's 5500 K. But the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio in spotless is higher than when there are spots. So the factor is (ratio when no spots) / (ratio when spots). 

In stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels (E2 > E1), k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV. So, this transition corresponds to a certain energy difference. Wait, maybe I don't need the exact wavelength, but knowing that the energy E is hc/λ. But maybe I can find the ratio using the temperatures.

Wait, but each part of the star's surface has a different temperature. Without spots, the entire surface is at 6000 K. But when 40% is spots, the rest is at the original temperature? Or does the overall Teff change, which means the average flux is lower. Hmm, but the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. So when spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the photosphere as a whole is cooler. 

Wait, but the spots are cooler regions, so the star's surface is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. But when the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, that's an average. But the question is about the photospheric conditions. So, the effective temperature is lower because the spots are cooler and cover a significant part of the surface. 

But when we look at the ratio of Ti levels, we have to consider the temperature in the photosphere. Wait, but the spots are dark, so their temperature is lower. But the rest is at higher temperature. So when spots are present, some regions are hotter (6000 K?), others are cooler, maybe like 5000 K. But the overall effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, the average is 5500 K. But the ratio is measured in the photosphere, which is at varying temperatures? Hmm, but LTE is assumed. So each region is in local thermal equilibrium.

Wait, but the astronomer is looking at the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels. How does this ratio depend on temperature? The Boltzmann factor is exponential in temperature. So higher temperature would lead to more excitation, meaning higher populations in higher energy levels.

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So a higher T would make the exponential term smaller (since you're dividing by a larger T; wait, no: wait, when T increases, ΔE/(kT) decreases, so the exp(-x) becomes larger. Wait, no. Let's think: exponential of negative something. So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the value increases. So n1/n2 increases with T? Or wait, if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So as T increases, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases (since denominator kT is bigger, ΔE/(kT) smaller, so negative of that is bigger, so exp returns a larger number). So n1/n2 increases with T. So a hotter star would have a higher ratio of n1/n2.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is lower. The observed ratio is lower when the star has spots. So when the star is spotless (Teff =6000K), the ratio is higher. So the factor is (spotless ratio) / (spotty ratio) = [n1/n2 (6000)] / [n1/n2 (5500)].

Wait, but wait. The star isn't uniformly at 6000K when spots are present. Because 40% is covered by spots, which are cooler, so the average is 5500K. But each region is at a different T. So perhaps the observed ratio is a combination of the two regions.

Hmm, but the question says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio, it decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps we can model the overall ratio as a sum of the contributions from each region.

But that sounds complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying it by considering the effective temperature as the relevant parameter. Because the problem says the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K, which is the average. So the ratio is calculated using T_eff.

Wait, but how would the presence of spots affect the observed ratio? If the star has spots, the photosphere's average T is lower, but the actual regions (unspotted and spotted) have different temperatures. But each region's emission contributes to the observed spectrum line. So when the star has spots, some of the line is from hotter regions, some from cooler.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So perhaps it's considering the average over the entire photosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the effective temperature is the same as the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation. So when the star is spotless, T=6000 K; when it has spots, T=5500 K. So the ratio changes based on this T.

Wait, but the ratio is the same across the entire photosphere when in LTE. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, so the ratio is lower because the exponential term is smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). 

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (because of spots), the ratio is lower. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But wait, in the question, the ratio is the number of neutral Ti in two levels. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots.

So let's compute the ratio of the ratios.

Let me write the formula.

Let’s denote:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -h c / (λ k T) )

Wait, ΔE = h c / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ the wavelength.

So the ratio is proportional to exp( - h c / (λ k T) )

So, ratio when no spots (R1) = exp( -h c / (λ k T1) )

Ratio when spots (R2) = exp( -h c / (λ k T2) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( [ h c / (λ k T2) ) - ( h c / (λ k T1) ) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( (h c)/(λ k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Let me plug in the numbers.

T1 = 6000 K, T2=5500 K.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

Compute the exponent:

( h c )/(λ k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute h c / (λ k):

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

λ k = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.002e-30 J m K

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute h c/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. Multiply by k: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.002e-30 J m K

So h c/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25) / (2.002e-30) ) = approximately 9.925e4.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 2.002e-30 = (1.9878 / 2.002) * 1e5 ≈ 0.9929 * 1e5 ≈ 9.929e4.

So approximately 9.93e4.

Now, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Difference ≈ 0.000015151.

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) ≈ 1.515e-5 1/K.

So the exponent is (9.93e4 ) * (1.515e-5 ) = ?

Compute 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93 * 1.515 * 1e-1.

9.93 *1.515 ≈ let's see, 10 *1.515=15.15; subtract 0.07*1.515=0.106 → ≈15.15 -0.106 =15.044.

Multiply by 1e-1 → 1.5044.

So the exponent is approximately 1.504.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.504) ≈ e^1.504.

What's e^1.5? Approximately 4.48. Let me double-check: e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

So the factor is about 4.48.

But wait, the options given are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So 4.48 is closest to option C) ~4.5.

But wait, did I compute the exponent correctly?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

λ = 1448e-10 m.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So denominator: λ k =1448e-10 m *1.38e-23 J/K = 1448 *1.38e-33 J m/K.

Wait 1448 *1.38 = let's compute 1400 *1.38= 1932, 48*1.38=66.24 → total 1998.24.

So denominator is 1998.24e-33 J m/K ≈ 1.998e-30 J m K.

So h c/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25 J m)/(1.998e-30 J m K) ) = (1.9878 /1.998 ) * 1e5 K^-1.

Wait, 1.9878 /1.998 ≈ approx 0.995.

So 0.995e5 K^-1 → 9.95e4 K^-1.

Wait, that's 99500 per K.

Then (1/T2 -1/T1) = (1/5500 -1/6000 ) → let me compute exactly:

1/5500 = 0.00018181818...

1/6000 = 0.00016666667...

Difference is 0.0000151515.

Which is 1.51515e-5 1/K.

So (h c/(λ k)) * (1/T2 -1/T1) = 99500 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ 99500 * 0.0000151515.

Compute 99500 * 0.0000151515.

Let me compute 99500 * 0.000015 = 1.4925.

And 99500 * 0.000000151515 ≈ 99500 * 1.51515e-7 ≈ approx 0.01505.

So total is approx 1.4925 + 0.01505 = 1.50755.

So exponent is about 1.5075.

e^1.5075 ≈ e^(1.5) is about 4.48, but with a bit more. Let me calculate e^1.5075.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504077. So e^1.504077=4.5.

Wait, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, yes.

So e^1.504 ≈4.5. So e^1.5075 is a bit higher than 4.5, perhaps around 4.52.

So the factor is approximately 4.52, which is about 4.5, matching option C.

So the answer is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze how the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \)) by \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light.

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (spotless) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (with spots). Substituting the values:

1. Compute \( \Delta E / k \):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}, \quad \Delta E / k = \frac{hc}{\lambda k}.
   \]
   Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):
   \[
   \Delta E / k = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{(1.448 \times 10^{-7})(1.38 \times 10^{-23})} \approx 9.93 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]

3. Compute the exponent:
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.93 \times 10^4)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.504.
   \]

4. Compute the factor:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.504) \approx 4.48.
   \]

Thus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it is spotless.

The closest option is **C) ~4.5**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let's see. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain properties and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. 

Alright, let's break it down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the spots are making the star cooler overall. 

The key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They say that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. The question asks by what factor the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, wait. So when the star is spotless, the Teff is higher (6000 K), and when it has spots, it's 5500 K. But the observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio in spotless is higher than when there are spots. So the factor is (ratio when no spots) / (ratio when spots). 

In stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels (E2 > E1), k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the transition is at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV. So, this transition corresponds to a certain energy difference. Wait, maybe I don't need the exact wavelength, but knowing that the energy E is hc/λ. But maybe I can find the ratio using the temperatures.

Wait, but each part of the star's surface has a different temperature. Without spots, the entire surface is at 6000 K. But when 40% is spots, the rest is at the original temperature? Or does the overall Teff change, which means the average flux is lower. Hmm, but the question is about the photospheric effective temperature. So when spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K.

But the question is about the photospheric conditions. So, the effective temperature is lower because the spots are cooler and cover a significant part of the surface. 

But when we look at the ratio of Ti levels, we have to consider the temperature in the photosphere. Wait, but the spots are dark, so their temperature is lower. But the rest is at higher temperature. So when spots are present, some regions are hotter (6000 K?), others are cooler, maybe like 5000 K. But the overall effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, the average is 5500 K. But the ratio is measured in the photosphere, which is at varying temperatures? Hmm, but LTE is assumed. So each region is in local thermal equilibrium.

Wait, but the astronomer is looking at the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels. How does this ratio depend on temperature? The Boltzmann factor is exponential in temperature. So higher temperature would lead to more excitation, meaning higher populations in higher energy levels.

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. So a higher T would make the exponential term smaller (since you're dividing by a larger T; wait, no: wait, when T increases, ΔE/(kT) decreases, so the exp(-x) becomes larger. Wait, no. Let's think: exponential of negative something. So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the value increases. So n1/n2 increases with T? Or wait, if ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), then (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So as T increases, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases (since denominator kT is bigger, ΔE/(kT) smaller, so negative of that is bigger, so exp returns a larger number). So n1/n2 increases with T. So a hotter star would have a higher ratio of n1/n2.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is lower. The observed ratio is lower when the star has spots. So when the star is spotless (Teff =6000K), the ratio is higher. So the factor is (spotless ratio) / (spotty ratio) = [n1/n2 (6000)] / [n1/n2 (5500)].

Wait, but wait. The star isn't uniformly at 6000K when spots are present. Because 40% is covered by spots, which are cooler, so the average is 5500K. But each region is at a different T. So perhaps the observed ratio is a combination of the two regions.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So perhaps it's considering the average over the entire photosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the effective temperature is the same as the temperature used in the Boltzmann equation. So when the star is spotless, T=6000 K; when it has spots, T=5500 K. So the ratio changes based on this T.

Wait, but the ratio is the same across the entire photosphere when in LTE. So when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, so the ratio is lower because the exponential term is smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). 

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (because of spots), the ratio is lower. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500.

But wait, in the question, the ratio is the number of neutral Ti in two levels. So when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_spots.

So let's compute the ratio of the ratios.

Let me write the formula.

Let’s denote:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -h c / (λ k T) )

Wait, ΔE = h c / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c speed of light, λ the wavelength.

So the ratio is proportional to exp( - h c / (λ k T) )

So, ratio when no spots (R1) = exp( -h c / (λ k T1) )

Ratio when spots (R2) = exp( -h c / (λ k T2) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( [ h c / (λ k T2) ) - ( h c / (λ k T1) ) ] )

Which simplifies to exp( (h c)/(λ k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

Let me plug in the numbers.

T1 = 6000 K, T2=5500 K.

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

k = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

Compute the exponent:

( h c )/(λ k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute h c / (λ k):

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

λ k = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.002e-30 J m K

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute h c/(λ k) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m. Multiply by k: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.002e-30 J m K

So h c/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25) / (2.002e-30) ) = approximately 9.925e4.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 2.002e-30 = (1.9878 / 2.002) * 1e5 ≈ 0.9929 * 1e5 ≈ 9.929e4.

So approximately 9.93e4.

Now, compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000 )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Difference ≈ 0.000015151.

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) ≈ 1.515e-5 1/K.

So the exponent is (9.93e4 ) * (1.515e-5 ) = ?

Compute 9.93e4 * 1.515e-5 = 9.93 * 1.515 * 1e-1.

9.93 *1.515 ≈ let's see, 10 *1.515=15.15; subtract 0.07*1.515=0.106 → ≈15.15 -0.106 =15.044.

Multiply by 1e-1 → 1.5044.

So the exponent is approximately 1.504.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.504) ≈ e^1.504.

What's e^1.5? Approximately 4.48. Let me double-check: e^1 is 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

So the factor is about 4.48.

But wait, the options given are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So 4.48 is closest to option C) ~4.5.

But wait, did I compute the exponent correctly?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

λ = 1448e-10 m.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K.

So denominator: λ k =1448e-10 m *1.38e-23 J/K = 1448 *1.38e-33 J m/K.

Wait 1448 *1.38 = let's compute 1400 *1.38= 1932, 48*1.38=66.24 → total 1998.24.

So denominator is 1998.24e-33 J m/K ≈ 1.998e-30 J m K.

So h c/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25 J m)/(1.998e-30 J m K) ) = (1.9878 /1.998 ) * 1e5 K^-1.

Wait, 1.9878 /1.998 ≈ approx 0.995.

So 0.995e5 K^-1 → 9.95e4 K^-1.

Wait, that's 99500 per K.

Then (1/T2 -1/T1) = (1/5500 -1/6000 ) → let me compute exactly:

1/5500 = 0.00018181818...

1/6000 = 0.00016666667...

Difference is 0.0000151515.

Which is 1.51515e-5 1/K.

So (h c/(λ k)) * (1/T2 -1/T1) = 99500 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ 99500 * 0.0000151515.

Compute 99500 * 0.0000151515.

Let me compute 99500 * 0.000015 = 1.4925.

And 99500 * 0.000000151515 ≈ 99500 * 1.51515e-7 ≈ approx 0.01505.

So total is approx 1.4925 + 0.01505 = 1.50755.

So exponent is about 1.5075.

e^1.5075 ≈ e^(1.5) is about 4.48, but with a bit more. Let me calculate e^1.5075.

We know that ln(4.5) is about 1.504077. So e^1.504077=4.5.

Wait, because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504, yes.

So e^1.504 ≈4.5. So e^1.5075 is a bit higher than 4.5, perhaps around 4.52.

So the factor is approximately 4.52, which is about 4.5, matching option C.

So the answer is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze how the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is related to the wavelength of the transition (\( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \)) by \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light.

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (spotless) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (with spots). Substituting the values:

1. Compute \( \Delta E / k \):
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}, \quad \Delta E / k = \frac{hc}{\lambda k}.
   \]
   Using \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \):
   \[
   \Delta E / k = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{(1.448 \times 10^{-7})(1.38 \times 10^{-23})} \approx 9.93 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]

3. Compute the exponent:
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.93 \times 10^4)(1.515 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.504.
   \]

4. Compute the factor:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(1.504) \approx 4.48.
   \]

Thus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it is spotless.

The closest option is **C) ~4.5**.
