Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two. So, I need to figure out what the product looks like after the reaction and then calculate its degree of unsaturation.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. The main ring is a cyclohexene, so that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-) at position 5. Also, there's an carboxylic acid group (COOH) somewhere. Wait, the numbering: the cyclohexene is at position 3, so maybe the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? So the structure would have a cyclohexene ring, with substituents at positions 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond), and 5 (vinyl).

Now, the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, I think that's a reaction where the phosphorus reacts with iodine in an elimination or addition reaction. Wait, wait, red phosphorus is often used with iodine in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups, like converting ketones to methylene groups. Alternatively, it might be about the reduction of carbonyl groups, but in the presence of HI, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction? No, that's for alpha-chlorination of carboxylic acids.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI—I remember that when a carbonyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it leads to the formation of an alkane. Like in the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, the reaction of a carbonyl with HI and P could be a way to add iodide. Wait, wait, maybe it's a 1,2-addition. For example, in the case of aldehydes, maybe the aldehyde group (CHO) gets converted to CH2I. Because when aldehydes react with HI, perhaps they undergo addition, but with red phosphorus, maybe it's a way to transfer the iodide.

Wait, no, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. Wait, but red phosphorus is a good reducing agent. Oh! Wait, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group. So, if the starting material has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde, treating it with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but maybe red phosphorus and HI can also reduce carbonyl groups. So, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2OH (but wait, wait, no, because HI is present. Alternatively, maybe it's a different pathway.)

Wait, another approach: when a ketone or aldehyde is treated with P and HI, it's a method for the formation of alkanes. Like, in the presence of HX (here, HI), and a reducing agent, the carbonyl is converted to CH2-X. Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a formyl group. So, maybe the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2I. Let me think: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be converted into CH2I. Because the mechanism would involve the formation of an intermediate where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by H and I. Wait, perhaps it's a crossed addition, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation of the aldehyde group. So, the CHO group becomes CH2 group. Because red phosphorus and HI are used in the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, no, I think that's not right. Maybe the aldehyde is being converted into an alkane.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific reaction. The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (double bond at position 3), a formyl group at position 2, and a vinyl group at position 5, along with a carboxylic acid group.

When this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? Let's break it down:

1. The carboxylic acid group (COOH): would it react under these conditions? Maybe not directly, because HI is a strong acid but I don't think it would react with the COOH in this context.

2. The formyl group (CHO): this is an aldehyde group. I think that when aldehydes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, they undergo a reaction where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by H and I. So, CHO becomes CH2I. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact product. Alternatively, could it be that the aldehyde group is reduced to a CH2 group? Because in some reductions, like with H2 and catalyst, aldehydes become CH2OH, but with stronger reducing agents, maybe to CH3. Wait, but here we have HI and P. So perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible alternative: the formyl group (CHO) is being converted into a CH2I group. So, the aldehyde becomes CH2I. Then, what about the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5? Wait, no, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is a double bond. So, the molecule has that vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but during the reaction with HI and red phosphorus, maybe the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would undergo some addition. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions don't affect the vinyl group, as red phosphorus and HI are more likely to react with the aldehyde and any conjugated systems.

Wait, maybe the key reaction is the reduction of the aldehyde group. So, the formyl group (CHO) would be converted into CH2OH, but wait, in the presence of excess HI, perhaps it's a different outcome. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is reduced to a CH2 group. Let me think: the Clemmensen reduction (Zn(Hg)/HCl) reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. So, perhaps in this case, the aldehyde (CHO) is reduced to CH2 group. So, the formyl group becomes CH2.

So, after reaction, the product would have a cyclohexene ring, a CH2 group at position 2 (from the former CHO), and the vinyl group at position 5 remains as is.

Wait, but the product is after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a CH2I group. Let me think about that. So, the aldehyde (CHO) would react with HI in the presence of red phosphorus to form CH2I.

But I'm not entirely confident about the specifics of the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Staudinger reaction? No, that's with azides. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility that the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group, and the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) might undergo some reaction. But if the HI is in excess, maybe the vinyl group (which is a double bond) would react. But wait, the cyclohexene ring already has a double bond, so maybe the vinyl group is another double bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the cyclohexene ring's double bond. But no, red phosphorus and HI are more about carbonyl reductions, I think.

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is undergoing addition of HI. So, in the presence of excess HI, the double bond would add HI, leading to a vicinal diiodide. But wait, that would be if the conditions are for addition reactions. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is undergoing halogenation.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the reaction conditions and what they usually do. Red phosphorus and HI—I believe that's used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, the Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 (hydrazine) and a strong base like KOH, followed by heating. Alternatively, another reaction where red phosphorus and HI are used is for the elimination of certain groups.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) is an aldehyde. Maybe the reaction is a crossed aldol addition or something else, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation reaction. Like, the formyl group (CHO) reacts with HI to form CH2I, while also releasing water or something else. So, the aldehyde becomes CH2I. Then, the cyclohexene ring remains as is, and the vinyl group is CH2=CH-.

Wait, but what about the vinyl group? If there's excess HI, maybe the double bond in the vinyl group would undergo addition. So, the CH2=CH- group would become CH2-CH2I, but that would require some mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the double bond would add HI across, making a diiodide. That would change the structure.

But the problem is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So, regardless of the specific structure, I need to calculate the degree of unsaturation of the product.

Let me plan my approach:

1. Determine what the reaction does to each functional group in the starting material.

2. Draw the structure of the product.

3. Calculate the degree of unsaturation.

First, let's think about the starting molecule:

The structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the main ring is cyclohexene (one double bond, so one degree of unsaturation). The substituents are:

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO) → which is an aldehyde, so a double bond (O), but in the degree of unsaturation, each double bond, ring, or triple bond counts as one. Each triple bond counts as two.

Wait, but the aldehyde group (CHO) has a double bond between C and O. That's another degree of unsaturation. So, the starting molecule has:

- Cyclohexene (1 double bond → 1)

- CHO group (another double bond → 1)

- Vinyl group (CH2=CH- → another double bond → 1)

So that's three degrees of unsaturation from the substituents. Plus, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, making it four.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute the degree of unsaturation for the starting material to get a better idea.

The formula for the index of hydrogen deficiency is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But in this case, the starting material may help me understand what's changing.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the degree of unsaturation for the starting compound and then see what changes after the reaction.

But maybe I should proceed step by step.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The molecular formula would be:

Cyclohexene is C6H10 (since cyclohexene is C6H10). But since it's a cyclohexene with substituents, let's count.

The substituents are:

- Formyl (CHO) adds one C, one O. So now, it's C7H9O.

Wait, no. Let's think about the whole molecule.

The cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons. The substituents are at positions 2, 5, and 3? Wait, the substituents are at 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond), and 5 (vinyl). Wait, no, the double bond is in the ring, so positions 3 and 4 are double bonded.

So the substituents are:

- Position 2: CHO (formyl group)

- Position 5: vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-)

So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CHO), 5 (CH2=CH-), and the ring has a double bond at 3-4.

Plus, the carboxylic acid group is probably at position 1 (since it's cyclohexene, and the numbering is such that the double bond is at 3, so substituents at 2, 5, and the COOH is maybe at 1? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.)

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the cyclohexene (double bond between C3 and C4) has substituents: at C2 (CHO), at C5 (vinyl), and at C1 (COOH).

So the molecular formula would be:

The cyclohexene ring (C6H10) → but with substituents, each substituent adds to the formula.

CHO is C=O, so adds one C, one O.

Vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which is CH2CH2? No, it's actually CH2=CH- as a substituent. Wait, substituents are attached to the ring. So the vinyl group is probably attached as a substituent at C5, so the structure is C5(CH2CH2?), no, actually, the vinyl is CH2=CH– attached to the ring at C5.

So, the formula would be:

Each substituent adds to the base ring.

The ring has 6 carbons. The substituents add:

- CHO: adds 1 C, 1 O.

- Vinyl: adds 2 C (CH2=CH– is two carbons), but wait, because it's attached as a substituent, the ring might have some structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H10O2.

Wait, perhaps better to count all the carbons:

Cyclohexene: 6 C.

CHO: 1 C.

Vinyl group: 2 C (since it's CH2=CH-).

COOH: 2 O (but in terms of C, it's one C).

Wait, but the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so perhaps it's at position 1.

So the total C is 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 10 C? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

The parent structure is cyclohexene: six carbons.

At C2: formyl (CHO) → adds one C.

At C5: vinyl (CH2=CH–) → adds two C.

At C1: COOH (–COOH) → adds one C.

So total C: 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10 C.

Hydrogens: let's see, the cyclohexene has 10 H normally, but substituents will change that.

Each substituent may add or subtract H.

CHO group is –CHO, which has one H.

Vinyl group is –CH2CH2 (no, it's –CH2–CH2? No, it's –CH2–CH2–? No, wait, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– but with a double bond, so it's –CH2–CH2– but that's a single bond? No, no, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2–, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, wait, the vinyl group is actually –CH2–CH2– but that can't be right. Wait, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– with a double bond between the two carbons attached to the ring. So, the substituent is –CH2–CH2– with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, wait, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– but that's a single bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, no, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– but that's an alkene, which is CH2=CH–. So, the substituent is –CH2–CH2– with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, wait, no. The vinyl group is –CH2–CH2–, but the double bond is between the two carbons. So, substituent is –CH2–CH2–, but it's actually –CH2–CH2– with a double bond. So, the structure is –CH2–CH2–, but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's –CH2–CH2– where the two CH2 are connected by a double bond → that's a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH– attached to the ring.

So, each substituent affects the H count:

- CHO: –CHO has one H.

- Vinyl group: –CH2–CH2– (but with a double bond) → each CH2 has two H each, but the double bond doesn't contribute to H. So, each substituent adds at the ring position.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should focus on the reaction and what it does.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, I think the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is reduced to CH2OH, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's reduced to CH3-.

Wait, considering the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI. I think that when an aldehyde reacts with HI and red phosphorus, the product is an alkane. Like, the CHO becomes CH2I. So, the formyl group (CHO) would be replaced by CH2I.

So, after the reaction, the product would have a CH2I group at position 2, the cyclohexene ring remains, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) may or may not react, and the COOH group is still present.

Wait, but the COOH group is a carboxylic acid. Would that react with HI and red phosphorus? Hmm, not sure. Maybe not under these conditions, so COOH remains as is.

So, the product after reaction would have:

- Cyclohexene ring (still has a double bond → one degree of unsaturation).

- CH2I group at position 2.

- Vinyl group at position 5 (CH2=CH– → another double bond → another degree of unsaturation.

Wait, but the vinyl group is attached to the ring. So, if the vinyl group is still present as CH2=CH–, then that's another double bond. So, the product would have two double bonds: one in the ring and one in the vinyl group.

Wait, but the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into CH2I. So, that group no longer has a double bond. So, the two degrees of unsaturation from the aldehyde and the vinyl group would change.

Wait, the starting material had:

- Cyclohexene (1 double bond → 1)

- CHO (1 double bond → 1)

- Vinyl (1 double bond → 1)

So, a total of 3 from substituents plus 1 from the ring → 4 degrees of unsaturation.

After reaction, the CHO becomes CH2I, so that degree is gone. The vinyl group is still CH2=CH–, so that's still 1. The cyclohexene ring is still there → 1. Any other changes?

Wait, the COOH group is –COOH. That has a double bond, so that's another degree. So, before reaction, the COOH group contributed another degree. So, starting material's index is 5?

Wait, wait, maybe I should recalculate the starting material's index.

Let me compute the degree of unsaturation for the starting material.

The formula is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Assuming the molecular formula is C10H10O2.

Wait, let me count:

Cyclohexene (6 C)

CHO (1 C)

Vinyl (2 C)

COOH (1 C)

Total: 6 +1 +2 +1 = 10 C.

Hydrogen: Let's see. The cyclohexene has 10 H normally. Each substituent changes H.

CHO has one H (the aldehyde H).

Vinyl group (CH2=CH–) attached to the ring: each CH2 has two H, but the double bond reduces the H count. For a vinyl group (–CH2–CH2–), but with a double bond → –CH2–CH2– would have four H (two on each CH2), but the double bond reduces it by two. Wait, no, each double bond reduces the H by 2. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) has two H on the first CH2 and one on the CH2 (if any? Or perhaps it's more accurate to consider the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the degree of unsaturation using the formula.

The formula for the starting compound would be C9H10O2? Or perhaps C10H10O2.

Wait, let me think:

The parent structure is cyclohexene: C6H10.

Each substituent adds:

- CHO (formyl): adds one C, one O, and one H (CHO is O=CH–).

Wait, no, the substituent is –CHO, which is O=CH– attached to the ring. So, for each substituent:

CHO: adds 1 C, 1 O, and the H depends on substitution.

Similarly, vinyl group (–CH2–CH2– with double bond) → adds 2 C and (each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces the H by 2. So, maybe the vinyl substituent adds 2 C, 4 H (since each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond makes it CH2=CH– → each has 2 and 1 H? No, perhaps for the substituent, considering it's –CH2–CH2–, but with a double bond, it's –CH2–CH2– with double bond between the two, so the substituent is –CH2–CH2–, but the double bond is internal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the molecular formula properly.

The starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The molecular formula would be C9H10O2.

Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. Each substituent adds:

- CHO: adds one C and one O. The H for CHO is one H (the aldehyde H).

- Vinyl: adds two C and (let's see, the substituent is –CH2–CH2– with a double bond, so the substituent is –CH2–CH2–, but actually, it's –CH2–CH2– with a double bond in between → so it's –CH2–CH2–, but with the double bond. So, the substituent is CH2=CH–, so two C, and each CH2 has two H, but the double bond reduces it. So, for the substituent, the formula is C2H3. Because:

Each CH2 would have two H each if no double bond. So, two CH2 groups would have four H, but with a double bond between them, two H are lost. So, substituent is C2H3.

COOH: adds two O and one C (–COOH is –COOH, so one C, two O, and two O in COOH, but the H depends on substitution.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the starting molecule has:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) → but with substituents:

At position 2: CHO → adds 1 C, 1 O, and one H (since CHO is O=CH– attached to the ring).

At position 5: vinyl (CH2=CH–) → adds 2 C, and for H: each CH2 has two H, but with a double bond, so overall the substituent contributes 3 H (since the double bond reduces H by two). So, 2 C, 3 H.

At position 1 (assuming): COOH → adds 2 O and one C. COOH has a structure of –COOH, which is O=C(OH)OH. But when attached to the ring, it's –COOH, which has two O and one more C. The substituent contributes two O and one C. So, the COOH group adds one C and two O.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to compute the molecular formula.

The starting molecule:

- 6 carbons from cyclohexene.

- 1 from CHO.

- 2 from vinyl.

- 1 from COOH.

Total: 6+1+2+1 = 10 C.

Hydrogen: the cyclohexene has 10 H. Each substituent:

CHO: –CHO has one H.

Vinyl: –CH2–CH2– with double bond → since it's a substituent, each CH2 group has two H, but the double bond reduces the total by two. So, the substituent contributes (2 + 2) – 2 = 2 H.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: a vinyl group (–CH2–CH2– with double bond) would have the structure –CH2–CH2–, but the double bond removes two H. So, the substituent contributes 4 – 2 = 2 H. Wait, wait, no. The substituent is –CH2–CH2– but with a double bond between the two carbons. So, each CH2 would have two H, but the double bond would mean that each has one H. So, each CH2 group has one H instead of two. So, substituent contributes 2 H.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the formula for the starting molecule is C10H10O2.

Because:

- The cyclohexene is C6H10.

- CHO adds one C, one O.

- Vinyl adds two C, three H? Or wait, maybe the total is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the degree of unsaturation using the formula.

The formula is CnHmOx.

The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 – m – x)/2.

Wait, but the formula is (2n +2 - m + x)/2? Wait, no, the formula is (2n +2 - m + x)/2, where x is the number of halogens. Wait, no, I think the formula is (2n +2 - m + x)/2, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the correct formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is the number of halogens and N is the number of nitrogens. But in this case, our starting molecule doesn't have any halogens, so X=0.

So, the formula for the starting material is C10H10O2.

So, n=10, m=10, X=0, O=2. So,

Degree of unsaturation = (2*10 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 → (22-10)/2=12/2=6.

Wait, that's six degrees of unsaturation. But earlier, I thought the starting material had four. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount. The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1 double bond), a formyl group (CHO, which has a double bond), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a COOH group (which has a double bond). So, four double bonds, which would contribute four degrees.

Wait, but the formula calculation says six. So, perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, the formula is C10H10O2.

Using the formula:

Degree of unsaturation = (2*10 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 → (22-10)/2 = 6.

So, 6 degrees of unsaturation.

Which would be accounted by:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene) → 1

- 3 double bonds (from CHO, vinyl, and COOH) → 3

- Plus, any other rings or double bonds.

Wait, how does that sum up to 6?

Wait, cyclohexene has one ring (which is a double bond in the ring, so one degree). The formyl group has a double bond (O), the vinyl group has a double bond, and the COOH group has a double bond. So, that's 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) = 4. But the formula gives 6. So, that's a discrepancy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some double bonds or rings.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, which is two degrees (one ring, one double bond?), but no, a ring is one degree, a double bond is another. So, the cyclohexene would contribute two degrees (one for the ring, one for the double bond). But wait, no, the ring itself is a single degree. Because a ring is a cyclic structure, which counts as one degree. The double bond within the ring is another. So, cyclohexene has two degrees: one from the ring, one from the double bond.

So, the starting material has:

- Cyclohexene: 2 degrees (ring + double bond).

- CHO: 1 double bond → 1.

- Vinyl: 1 double bond →1.

- COOH: 1 double bond →1.

Total: 2 +1 +1 +1=5.

But the formula calculation gives 6. So, where's the sixth?

Ah, perhaps the COOH group is –COOH, which has two double bonds? Because the structure is O=C(OH)OH. So, the carbonyl is a double bond (O=C-O), but wait, no, the COOH group is O=C(OH)2. So, the carbonyl is a double bond, which is one degree. So, the COOH contributes one.

Wait, but then that's five degrees. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Let me compute it again.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The molecular formula would be:

Cyclohexene: 6 C, 10 H.

CHO (formyl): adds 1 C, 1 O, and one H.

Vinyl group: adds 2 C, 2 H (since the substituent is CH2=CH–, which is two C, and each has one H due to the double bond → 2 H).

COOH: adds 2 O and one C, and two H (since it's –COOH, which has two O and one C. H count: perhaps two from the -OH groups, but I'm not sure.)

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H10O2.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the reaction part and see what the product's structure would be, then calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Assuming the reaction converts the formyl group (CHO) to CH2I. So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene ring (still with a double bond → 1 degree)

- CH2I group at position 2 (no double bonds → 0)

- Vinyl group at position 5 (CH2=CH– → 1 degree)

- COOH group (still has a double bond → 1 degree)

So, total degrees of unsaturation would be 1 +1 +1 = 3? Plus any other.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond → 1.

The vinyl group → 1.

COOH → 1.

So, total 3.

But wait, the cyclohexene ring also has a ring structure, which is another degree. So, the ring (1) + the double bond in the ring (1) → 2.

Plus the vinyl (1), COOH (1) → total 4.

Wait, but if the formyl group is converted to CH2I, which has no double bonds, so it doesn't contribute.

Wait, but perhaps the product's structure is such that the ring's double bond is gone. Because, during the reaction, maybe the ring's double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, no, the reaction conditions are with HI and red phosphorus. So, perhaps the ring remains as a cyclohexene.

So, the product has:

- Cyclohexene (ring + double bond → 2 degrees)

- CH2I (no unsaturation → 0)

- Vinyl group (double bond →1)

- COOH (double bond →1)

So, 2 +1 +1=4 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but that's 4, which isn't one of the options given. The options are 1,3,5,0.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction causes the cyclohexene ring to become saturated.

Wait, how? Because sometimes, reactions with HX can add across double bonds. So, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond reacts with HI, it would become a diiodide, saturating the ring. But that would require the presence of HI and some conditions. But in this case, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the formyl group and any other carbonyl groups, and the cyclohexene remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that. Hydrogenation usually requires H2 and a catalyst.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again.

The product after reaction would have:

- The formyl group (CHO) converted into CH2I → no double bond.

- The COOH group remains → one double bond.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) remains → another double bond.

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond remains → another.

So, total degrees: 3.

But the options don't have 3 as a choice. Wait, option B is 3.

Wait, but what about the ring? The cyclohexene ring has a double bond, which is two degrees (one for the ring, one for the double bond?), but no, the ring is one degree, the double bond is another. So, two in total.

So, product has:

- Ring (2 degrees) → 2.

- Vinyl (1 → another).

- COOH (1 → another).

Total: 4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction also causes the vinyl group to add HI, making it a single bond. So, if the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) reacts with HI to add across the double bond, making CH2-CH2I. That would eliminate the double bond, reducing the degree of unsaturation.

So, if the vinyl group's double bond is consumed, the product would have:

- cyclohexene: 2 degrees.

- COOH: 1.

Total: 3.

Which would match option B.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to both the formyl group being converted and the vinyl group's double bond being saturated.

But why would the vinyl group react? The reaction conditions are with excess HI, so perhaps the vinyl group undergoes addition.

So, the reaction steps:

1. Formyl group (CHO) → CH2I.

2. Vinyl group (CH2=CH–) → CH2-CH2I (after addition of HI).

So, the product would have:

- cyclohexene ring (still with a double bond → 2 degrees).

- COOH → 1 degree.

- CH2I from formyl → 0.

- CH2-CH2I from vinyl → no double bond → 0.

So, total degrees: 2 (from ring) +1 (COOH) = 3.

Which matches option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group doesn't react, and the ring remains.

But given the presence of excess HI, it's possible that the vinyl group's double bond is also opened.

So, the product would have:

- cyclohexene ring: 2 degrees.

- COOH: 1.

Total:3.

So, the answer would be B)3.

The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The degree of unsaturation is calculated based on the number of rings, double bonds, and triple bonds in the molecule, with each contributing one degree, and each triple bond contributing two degrees.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   - The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.  
   - It contains:
     - A cyclohexene ring (one double bond and one ring → 2 degrees of unsaturation).  
     - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2 (one double bond → 1 degree).  
     - A vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) at position 5 (one double bond → 1 degree).  
     - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1 (one double bond → 1 degree).  
   - Total degrees of unsaturation in the starting material: **5**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**:  
   - Red phosphorus and HI typically reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., aldehydes) to alkanes. Thus, the formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH₂I.  
   - The vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) reacts with excess HI, leading to the addition of HI across the double bond, resulting in CH₂-CH₂I (no double bond remaining).  
   - The cyclohexene ring remains unchanged, retaining its double bond and ring structure.  
   - The carboxylic acid group (COOH) remains unaffected by the reaction conditions.  

3. **Structure of the Product**:  
   - Cyclohexene ring: Retains its double bond and ring structure → **2 degrees of unsaturation**.  
   - CH₂I (from the formyl group): No double bonds → **0 degrees of unsaturation**.  
   - CH₂-CH₂I (from the vinyl group): No double bonds → **0 degrees of unsaturation**.  
   - COOH: Retains its double bond → **1 degree of unsaturation**.  
   - Total degrees of unsaturation in the product: **3**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**, corresponding to the cyclohexene ring (2 degrees), the carboxylic acid group (1 degree), and no contributions from the formyl or vinyl groups.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two. So, I need to figure out what the product looks like after the reaction and then calculate its degree of unsaturation.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize its structure. The main ring is a cyclohexene, so that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-) at position 5. Also, there's an carboxylic acid group (COOH) somewhere. Wait, the numbering: the cyclohexene is at position 3, so maybe the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? So the structure would have a cyclohexene ring, with substituents at positions 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond), and 5 (vinyl).

Now, the reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, I think that's a reaction where the phosphorus reacts with iodine in an elimination or addition reaction. Wait, wait, red phosphorus is often used with iodine in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for removing carbonyl groups, like converting ketones to methylene groups. Alternatively, it might be about the reduction of carbonyl groups, but in the presence of HI, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction? No, that's for alpha-chlorination of carboxylic acids.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI—I remember that when a carbonyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it leads to the formation of an alkane. Like in the Clemmensen reduction, which uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, the reaction of a carbonyl with HI and P could be a way to add iodide. Wait, wait, maybe it's a 1,2-addition. For example, in the case of aldehydes, maybe the aldehyde group (CHO) gets converted to CH2I. Because when aldehydes react with HI, perhaps they undergo addition, but with red phosphorus, maybe it's a way to transfer the iodide.

Wait, no, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. Wait, but red phosphorus is a good reducing agent. Oh! Wait, maybe the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group. So, if the starting material has a formyl group (CHO), which is an aldehyde, treating it with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but maybe red phosphorus and HI can also reduce carbonyl groups. So, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2OH (but wait, wait, no, because HI is present. Alternatively, maybe it's a different pathway.)

Wait, another approach: when a ketone or aldehyde is treated with P and HI, it's a method for the formation of alkanes. Like, in the presence of HX (here, HI), and a reducing agent, the carbonyl is converted to CH2-X. Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a formyl group. So, maybe the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH2I. Let me think: in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be converted into CH2I. Because the mechanism would involve the formation of an intermediate where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by H and I. Wait, perhaps it's a crossed addition, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation of the aldehyde group. So, the CHO group becomes CH2 group. Because red phosphorus and HI are used in the dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, no, I think that's not right. Maybe the aldehyde is being converted into an alkane.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the specific reaction. The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (double bond at position 3), a formyl group at position 2, and a vinyl group at position 5, along with a carboxylic acid group.

When this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens? Let's break it down:

1. The carboxylic acid group (COOH): would it react under these conditions? Maybe not directly, because HI is a strong acid but I don't think it would react with the COOH in this context.

2. The formyl group (CHO): this is an aldehyde group. I think that when aldehydes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, they undergo a reaction where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by H and I. So, CHO becomes CH2I. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact product. Alternatively, could it be that the aldehyde group is reduced to a CH2 group? Because in some reductions, like with H2 and catalyst, aldehydes become CH2OH, but with stronger reducing agents, maybe to CH3. Wait, but here we have HI and P. So perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible alternative: the formyl group (CHO) is being converted into a CH2I group. So, the aldehyde becomes CH2I. Then, what about the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5? Wait, no, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, the substituent is a double bond. So, the molecule has that vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but during the reaction with HI and red phosphorus, maybe the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would undergo some addition. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions don't affect the vinyl group, as red phosphorus and HI are more likely to react with the aldehyde and any conjugated systems.

Wait, maybe the key reaction is the reduction of the aldehyde group. So, the formyl group (CHO) would be converted into CH2OH, but wait, in the presence of excess HI, perhaps it's a different outcome. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is reduced to a CH2 group. Let me think: the Clemmensen reduction (Zn(Hg)/HCl) reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. So, perhaps in this case, the aldehyde (CHO) is reduced to CH2 group. So, the formyl group becomes CH2.

So, after reaction, the product would have a cyclohexene ring, a CH2 group at position 2 (from the former CHO), and the vinyl group at position 5 remains as is.

Wait, but the product is after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the formyl group is converted into a CH2I group. Let me think about that. So, the aldehyde (CHO) would react with HI in the presence of red phosphorus to form CH2I.

But I'm not entirely confident about the specifics of the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation or elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Staudinger reaction? No, that's with azides. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility that the formyl group is converted into a CH2 group, and the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) might undergo some reaction. But if the HI is in excess, maybe the vinyl group (which is a double bond) would react. But wait, the cyclohexene ring already has a double bond, so maybe the vinyl group is another double bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the cyclohexene ring's double bond. But no, red phosphorus and HI are more about carbonyl reductions, I think.

Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is undergoing addition of HI. So, in the presence of excess HI, the double bond would add HI, leading to a vicinal diiodide. But wait, that would be if the conditions are for addition reactions. Alternatively, maybe the vinyl group is undergoing halogenation.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the reaction conditions and what they usually do. Red phosphorus and HI—I believe that's used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but wait, the Wolff-Kishner uses NH2NH2 (hydrazine) and a strong base like KOH, followed by heating. Alternatively, another reaction where red phosphorus and HI are used is for the elimination of certain groups.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) is an aldehyde. Maybe the reaction is a crossed aldol addition or something else, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's a hydrohalogenation reaction. Like, the formyl group (CHO) reacts with HI to form CH2I, while also releasing water or something else. So, the aldehyde becomes CH2I. Then, the cyclohexene ring remains as is, and the vinyl group is CH2=CH-.

Wait, but what about the vinyl group? If there's excess HI, maybe the double bond in the vinyl group would undergo addition. So, the CH2=CH- group would become CH2-CH2I, but that would require some mechanism. Alternatively, maybe the double bond would add HI across, making a diiodide. That would change the structure.

But the problem is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So, regardless of the specific structure, I need to calculate the degree of unsaturation of the product.

Let me plan my approach:

1. Determine what the reaction does to each functional group in the starting material.

2. Draw the structure of the product.

3. Calculate the degree of unsaturation.

First, let's think about the starting molecule:

The structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the main ring is cyclohexene (one double bond, so one degree of unsaturation). The substituents are:

- At position 2: formyl group (CHO) → which is an aldehyde, so a double bond (O), but in the degree of unsaturation, each double bond, ring, or triple bond counts as one. Each triple bond counts as two.

Wait, but the aldehyde group (CHO) has a double bond between C and O. That's another degree of unsaturation. So, the starting molecule has:

- Cyclohexene (1 double bond → 1)

- CHO group (another double bond → 1)

- Vinyl group (CH2=CH- → another double bond → 1)

So that's three degrees of unsaturation from the substituents. Plus, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, making it four.

Wait, wait, maybe I should compute the degree of unsaturation for the starting material to get a better idea.

The formula for the index of hydrogen deficiency is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But in this case, the starting material may help me understand what's changing.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the degree of unsaturation for the starting compound and then see what changes after the reaction.

But maybe I should proceed step by step.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The molecular formula would be:

Cyclohexene is C6H10 (since cyclohexene is C6H10). But since it's a cyclohexene with substituents, let's count.

The substituents are:

- Formyl (CHO) adds one C, one O. So now, it's C7H9O.

Wait, no. Let's think about the whole molecule.

The cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons. The substituents are at positions 2, 5, and 3? Wait, the substituents are at 2 (CHO), 3 (double bond), and 5 (vinyl). Wait, no, the double bond is in the ring, so positions 3 and 4 are double bonded.

So the substituents are:

- Position 2: CHO (formyl group)

- Position 5: vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-)

So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CHO), 5 (CH2=CH-), and the ring has a double bond at 3-4.

Plus, the carboxylic acid group is probably at position 1 (since it's cyclohexene, and the numbering is such that the double bond is at 3, so substituents at 2, 5, and the COOH is maybe at 1? Or perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.)

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is that the cyclohexene (double bond between C3 and C4) has substituents: at C2 (CHO), at C5 (vinyl), and at C1 (COOH).

So the molecular formula would be:

The cyclohexene ring (C6H10) → but with substituents, each substituent adds to the formula.

CHO is C=O, so adds one C, one O.

Vinyl group is CH2=CH-, which is CH2CH2? No, it's actually CH2=CH- as a substituent. Wait, substituents are attached to the ring. So the vinyl group is probably attached as a substituent at C5, so the structure is C5(CH2CH2?), no, actually, the vinyl is CH2=CH– attached to the ring at C5.

So, the formula would be:

Each substituent adds to the base ring.

The ring has 6 carbons. The substituents add:

- CHO: adds 1 C, 1 O.

- Vinyl: adds 2 C (CH2=CH– is two carbons), but wait, because it's attached as a substituent, the ring might have some structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H10O2.

Wait, perhaps better to count all the carbons:

Cyclohexene: 6 C.

CHO: 1 C.

Vinyl group: 2 C (since it's CH2=CH-).

COOH: 2 O (but in terms of C, it's one C).

Wait, but the COOH is a substituent on the ring, so perhaps it's at position 1.

So the total C is 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 10 C? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

The parent structure is cyclohexene: six carbons.

At C2: formyl (CHO) → adds one C.

At C5: vinyl (CH2=CH–) → adds two C.

At C1: COOH (–COOH) → adds one C.

So total C: 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10 C.

Hydrogens: let's see, the cyclohexene has 10 H normally, but substituents will change that.

Each substituent may add or subtract H.

CHO group is –CHO, which has one H.

Vinyl group is –CH2CH2 (no, it's –CH2–CH2? No, it's –CH2–CH2–? No, wait, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– but with a double bond, so it's –CH2–CH2– but that's a single bond? No, no, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2–, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, wait, the vinyl group is actually –CH2–CH2– but that can't be right. Wait, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– with a double bond between the two carbons attached to the ring. So, the substituent is –CH2–CH2– with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. No, wait, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– but that's a single bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, no, the vinyl group is –CH2–CH2– but that's an alkene, which is CH2=CH–. So, the substituent is –CH2–CH2– with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, wait, no. The vinyl group is –CH2–CH2–, but the double bond is between the two carbons. So, substituent is –CH2–CH2–, but it's actually –CH2–CH2– with a double bond. So, the structure is –CH2–CH2–, but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's –CH2–CH2– where the two CH2 are connected by a double bond → that's a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH– attached to the ring.

So, each substituent affects the H count:

- CHO: –CHO has one H.

- Vinyl group: –CH2–CH2– (but with a double bond) → each CH2 has two H each, but the double bond doesn't contribute to H. So, each substituent adds at the ring position.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should focus on the reaction and what it does.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, I think the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is reduced to CH2OH, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's reduced to CH3-.

Wait, considering the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI. I think that when an aldehyde reacts with HI and red phosphorus, the product is an alkane. Like, the CHO becomes CH2I. So, the formyl group (CHO) would be replaced by CH2I.

So, after the reaction, the product would have a CH2I group at position 2, the cyclohexene ring remains, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) may or may not react, and the COOH group is still present.

Wait, but the COOH group is a carboxylic acid. Would that react with HI and red phosphorus? Hmm, not sure. Maybe not under these conditions, so COOH remains as is.

So, the product after reaction would have:

- Cyclohexene ring (still has a double bond → one degree of unsaturation).

- CH2I group at position 2.

- Vinyl group at position 5 (CH2=CH– → another double bond → another degree of unsaturation.

Wait, but the vinyl group is attached to the ring. So, if the vinyl group is still present as CH2=CH–, then that's another double bond. So, the product would have two double bonds: one in the ring and one in the vinyl group.

Wait, but the aldehyde group (CHO) is converted into CH2I. So, that group no longer has a double bond. So, the two degrees of unsaturation from the aldehyde and the vinyl group would change.

Wait, the starting material had:

- Cyclohexene (1 double bond → 1)

- CHO (1 double bond → 1)

- Vinyl (1 double bond → 1)

So, a total of 3 from substituents plus 1 from the ring → 4 degrees of unsaturation.

After reaction, the CHO becomes CH2I, so that degree is gone. The vinyl group is still CH2=CH–, so that's still 1. The cyclohexene ring is still there → 1. Any other changes?

Wait, the COOH group is –COOH. That has a double bond, so that's another degree. So, before reaction, the COOH group contributed another degree. So, starting material's index is 5?

Wait, wait, maybe I should recalculate the starting material's index.

Let me compute the degree of unsaturation for the starting material.

The formula is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Assuming the molecular formula is C10H10O2.

Wait, let me count:

Cyclohexene (6 C)

CHO (1 C)

Vinyl (2 C)

COOH (1 C)

Total: 6 +1 +2 +1 = 10 C.

Hydrogen: Let's see. The cyclohexene has 10 H normally. Each substituent changes H.

CHO has one H (the aldehyde H).

Vinyl group (CH2=CH–) attached to the ring: each CH2 has two H, but the double bond reduces the H count. For a vinyl group (–CH2–CH2–), but with a double bond → –CH2–CH2– would have four H (two on each CH2), but the double bond reduces it by two. Wait, no, each double bond reduces the H by 2. So, the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) has two H on the first CH2 and one on the CH2 (if any? Or perhaps it's more accurate to consider the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the degree of unsaturation using the formula.

The formula for the starting compound would be C9H10O2? Or perhaps C10H10O2.

Wait, let me think:

The parent structure is cyclohexene: C6H10.

Each substituent adds:

- CHO (formyl): adds one C, one O, and one H (CHO is O=CH–).

Wait, no, the substituent is –CHO, which is O=CH– attached to the ring. So, for each substituent:

CHO: adds 1 C, 1 O, and the H depends on substitution.

Similarly, vinyl group (–CH2–CH2– with double bond) → adds 2 C and (each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond reduces the H by 2. So, maybe the vinyl substituent adds 2 C, 4 H (since each CH2 has 2 H, but the double bond makes it CH2=CH– → each has 2 and 1 H? No, perhaps for the substituent, considering it's –CH2–CH2–, but with a double bond, it's –CH2–CH2– with double bond between the two, so the substituent is –CH2–CH2–, but the double bond is internal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the molecular formula properly.

The starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The molecular formula would be C9H10O2.

Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. Each substituent adds:

- CHO: adds one C and one O. The H for CHO is one H (the aldehyde H).

- Vinyl: adds two C and (let's see, the substituent is –CH2–CH2– with a double bond, so the substituent is –CH2–CH2–, but actually, it's –CH2–CH2– with a double bond in between → so it's –CH2–CH2–, but with the double bond. So, the substituent is CH2=CH–, so two C, and each CH2 has two H, but the double bond reduces it. So, for the substituent, the formula is C2H3. Because:

Each CH2 would have two H each if no double bond. So, two CH2 groups would have four H, but with a double bond between them, two H are lost. So, substituent is C2H3.

COOH: adds two O and one C (–COOH is –COOH, so one C, two O, and two O in COOH, but the H depends on substitution.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the starting molecule has:

Cyclohexene (C6H10) → but with substituents:

At position 2: CHO → adds 1 C, 1 O, and one H (since CHO is O=CH– attached to the ring).

At position 5: vinyl (CH2=CH–) → adds 2 C, and for H: each CH2 has two H, but with a double bond, so overall the substituent contributes 3 H (since the double bond reduces H by two). So, 2 C, 3 H.

At position 1 (assuming): COOH → adds 2 O and one C. COOH has a structure of –COOH, which is O=C(OH)OH. But when attached to the ring, it's –COOH, which has two O and one more C. The substituent contributes two O and one C. So, the COOH group adds one C and two O.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to compute the molecular formula.

The starting molecule:

- 6 carbons from cyclohexene.

- 1 from CHO.

- 2 from vinyl.

- 1 from COOH.

Total: 6+1+2+1 = 10 C.

Hydrogen: the cyclohexene has 10 H. Each substituent:

CHO: –CHO has one H.

Vinyl: –CH2–CH2– with double bond → since it's a substituent, each CH2 group has two H, but the double bond reduces the total by two. So, the substituent contributes (2 + 2) – 2 = 2 H.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: a vinyl group (–CH2–CH2– with double bond) would have the structure –CH2–CH2–, but the double bond removes two H. So, the substituent contributes 4 – 2 = 2 H. Wait, wait, no. The substituent is –CH2–CH2– but with a double bond between the two carbons. So, each CH2 would have two H, but the double bond would mean that each has one H. So, each CH2 group has one H instead of two. So, substituent contributes 2 H.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the formula for the starting molecule is C10H10O2.

Because:

- The cyclohexene is C6H10.

- CHO adds one C, one O.

- Vinyl adds two C, three H? Or wait, maybe the total is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the degree of unsaturation using the formula.

The formula is CnHmOx.

The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 – m – x)/2.

Wait, but the formula is (2n +2 - m + x)/2? Wait, no, the formula is (2n +2 - m + x)/2, where x is the number of halogens. Wait, no, I think the formula is (2n +2 - m + x)/2, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the correct formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is the number of halogens and N is the number of nitrogens. But in this case, our starting molecule doesn't have any halogens, so X=0.

So, the formula for the starting material is C10H10O2.

So, n=10, m=10, X=0, O=2. So,

Degree of unsaturation = (2*10 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 → (22-10)/2=12/2=6.

Wait, that's six degrees of unsaturation. But earlier, I thought the starting material had four. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recount. The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1 double bond), a formyl group (CHO, which has a double bond), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a COOH group (which has a double bond). So, four double bonds, which would contribute four degrees.

Wait, but the formula calculation says six. So, perhaps there's more to it.

Wait, the formula is C10H10O2.

Using the formula:

Degree of unsaturation = (2*10 +2 -10 -0 +0)/2 → (22-10)/2 = 6.

So, 6 degrees of unsaturation.

Which would be accounted by:

- 1 ring (cyclohexene) → 1

- 3 double bonds (from CHO, vinyl, and COOH) → 3

- Plus, any other rings or double bonds.

Wait, how does that sum up to 6?

Wait, cyclohexene has one ring (which is a double bond in the ring, so one degree). The formyl group has a double bond (O), the vinyl group has a double bond, and the COOH group has a double bond. So, that's 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) = 4. But the formula gives 6. So, that's a discrepancy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some double bonds or rings.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, which is two degrees (one ring, one double bond?), but no, a ring is one degree, a double bond is another. So, the cyclohexene would contribute two degrees (one for the ring, one for the double bond). But wait, no, the ring itself is a single degree. Because a ring is a cyclic structure, which counts as one degree. The double bond within the ring is another. So, cyclohexene has two degrees: one from the ring, one from the double bond.

So, the starting material has:

- Cyclohexene: 2 degrees (ring + double bond).

- CHO: 1 double bond → 1.

- Vinyl: 1 double bond →1.

- COOH: 1 double bond →1.

Total: 2 +1 +1 +1=5.

But the formula calculation gives 6. So, where's the sixth?

Ah, perhaps the COOH group is –COOH, which has two double bonds? Because the structure is O=C(OH)OH. So, the carbonyl is a double bond (O=C-O), but wait, no, the COOH group is O=C(OH)2. So, the carbonyl is a double bond, which is one degree. So, the COOH contributes one.

Wait, but then that's five degrees. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Let me compute it again.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The molecular formula would be:

Cyclohexene: 6 C, 10 H.

CHO (formyl): adds 1 C, 1 O, and one H.

Vinyl group: adds 2 C, 2 H (since the substituent is CH2=CH–, which is two C, and each has one H due to the double bond → 2 H).

COOH: adds 2 O and one C, and two H (since it's –COOH, which has two O and one C. H count: perhaps two from the -OH groups, but I'm not sure.)

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C9H10O2.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the reaction part and see what the product's structure would be, then calculate the degree of unsaturation.

Assuming the reaction converts the formyl group (CHO) to CH2I. So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexene ring (still with a double bond → 1 degree)

- CH2I group at position 2 (no double bonds → 0)

- Vinyl group at position 5 (CH2=CH– → 1 degree)

- COOH group (still has a double bond → 1 degree)

So, total degrees of unsaturation would be 1 +1 +1 = 3? Plus any other.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond → 1.

The vinyl group → 1.

COOH → 1.

So, total 3.

But wait, the cyclohexene ring also has a ring structure, which is another degree. So, the ring (1) + the double bond in the ring (1) → 2.

Plus the vinyl (1), COOH (1) → total 4.

Wait, but if the formyl group is converted to CH2I, which has no double bonds, so it doesn't contribute.

Wait, but perhaps the product's structure is such that the ring's double bond is gone. Because, during the reaction, maybe the ring's double bond is hydrogenated.

Wait, no, the reaction conditions are with HI and red phosphorus. So, perhaps the ring remains as a cyclohexene.

So, the product has:

- Cyclohexene (ring + double bond → 2 degrees)

- CH2I (no unsaturation → 0)

- Vinyl group (double bond →1)

- COOH (double bond →1)

So, 2 +1 +1=4 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but that's 4, which isn't one of the options given. The options are 1,3,5,0.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction causes the cyclohexene ring to become saturated.

Wait, how? Because sometimes, reactions with HX can add across double bonds. So, if the cyclohexene ring's double bond reacts with HI, it would become a diiodide, saturating the ring. But that would require the presence of HI and some conditions. But in this case, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the formyl group and any other carbonyl groups, and the cyclohexene remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI would do that. Hydrogenation usually requires H2 and a catalyst.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again.

The product after reaction would have:

- The formyl group (CHO) converted into CH2I → no double bond.

- The COOH group remains → one double bond.

- The vinyl group (CH2=CH–) remains → another double bond.

- The cyclohexene ring's double bond remains → another.

So, total degrees: 3.

But the options don't have 3 as a choice. Wait, option B is 3.

Wait, but what about the ring? The cyclohexene ring has a double bond, which is two degrees (one for the ring, one for the double bond?), but no, the ring is one degree, the double bond is another. So, two in total.

So, product has:

- Ring (2 degrees) → 2.

- Vinyl (1 → another).

- COOH (1 → another).

Total: 4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction also causes the vinyl group to add HI, making it a single bond. So, if the vinyl group (CH2=CH–) reacts with HI to add across the double bond, making CH2-CH2I. That would eliminate the double bond, reducing the degree of unsaturation.

So, if the vinyl group's double bond is consumed, the product would have:

- cyclohexene: 2 degrees.

- COOH: 1.

Total: 3.

Which would match option B.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to both the formyl group being converted and the vinyl group's double bond being saturated.

But why would the vinyl group react? The reaction conditions are with excess HI, so perhaps the vinyl group undergoes addition.

So, the reaction steps:

1. Formyl group (CHO) → CH2I.

2. Vinyl group (CH2=CH–) → CH2-CH2I (after addition of HI).

So, the product would have:

- cyclohexene ring (still with a double bond → 2 degrees).

- COOH → 1 degree.

- CH2I from formyl → 0.

- CH2-CH2I from vinyl → no double bond → 0.

So, total degrees: 2 (from ring) +1 (COOH) = 3.

Which matches option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group doesn't react, and the ring remains.

But given the presence of excess HI, it's possible that the vinyl group's double bond is also opened.

So, the product would have:

- cyclohexene ring: 2 degrees.

- COOH: 1.

Total:3.

So, the answer would be B)3.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The degree of unsaturation is calculated based on the number of rings, double bonds, and triple bonds in the molecule, with each contributing one degree, and each triple bond contributing two degrees.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   - The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.  
   - It contains:
     - A cyclohexene ring (one double bond and one ring → 2 degrees of unsaturation).  
     - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2 (one double bond → 1 degree).  
     - A vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) at position 5 (one double bond → 1 degree).  
     - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1 (one double bond → 1 degree).  
   - Total degrees of unsaturation in the starting material: **5**.

2. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and Excess HI**:  
   - Red phosphorus and HI typically reduce carbonyl groups (e.g., aldehydes) to alkanes. Thus, the formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH₂I.  
   - The vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) reacts with excess HI, leading to the addition of HI across the double bond, resulting in CH₂-CH₂I (no double bond remaining).  
   - The cyclohexene ring remains unchanged, retaining its double bond and ring structure.  
   - The carboxylic acid group (COOH) remains unaffected by the reaction conditions.  

3. **Structure of the Product**:  
   - Cyclohexene ring: Retains its double bond and ring structure → **2 degrees of unsaturation**.  
   - CH₂I (from the formyl group): No double bonds → **0 degrees of unsaturation**.  
   - CH₂-CH₂I (from the vinyl group): No double bonds → **0 degrees of unsaturation**.  
   - COOH: Retains its double bond → **1 degree of unsaturation**.  
   - Total degrees of unsaturation in the product: **3**.

### Conclusion:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**, corresponding to the cyclohexene ring (2 degrees), the carboxylic acid group (1 degree), and no contributions from the formyl or vinyl groups.
