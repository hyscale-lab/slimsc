Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let's see what the question says.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one is a ketone. NaCN provides the CN- ion. The product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but how does the hydroxyl group get there?

Oh right, the addition of cyanide to a ketone forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction is usually done under acidic conditions because the ketone needs to be protonated to make it more electrophilic. So for the first part, reagent A should be something that provides H+ ions, like H3O+ (which is sulfuric acid, for example) or maybe something else acidic.

Looking at the product, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the cyanide added to the carbonyl carbon, and the proton from the acid adds to the oxygen. Then, when the oxygen gets protonated, it becomes a good leaving group, but actually, wait, in the cyanohydrin formation, the mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, which makes the carbonyl carbon more positive. Then the CN- attacks, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, and then the proton from the acid (or water?) is transferred. Wait, but the work-up step—maybe the reaction is done in acidic conditions, then the solution is neutralized or something?

Wait, but the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. So for the first reaction, the reagents would be NaCN and an acid catalyst like H3O+ (which is option A or B) or NaHSO3 (which is a source of H+ as well, but I think more for other reactions like epoxidation maybe).

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. It's used in reactions like the sulfite addition to carbonyl groups. But wait, in the first reaction, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed with HCN and a proton source. NaCN is providing the cyanide, but the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. So reagent A is probably H3O+ (like H2SO4) because that's a common acid catalyst for such additions.

So in the options, for part A, options A and B have H3O+ as A. Options C and D have NaHSO3 as A. So perhaps I can rule out C and D for the first part.

Wait, but why would someone use NaHSO3 as a catalyst here? Because in some reactions, like in the presence of ketones, you might get different behavior. Hmm, maybe not. I think cyanohydrin formation is typically acid-catalyzed, meaning a strong acid like H2SO4 or HCl. So reagent A is H3O+.

So the first part, A is H3O+. So options A or B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B and H2O to give the corresponding acid, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, what's the structure here? The starting material has a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the nitrile is at the same position as the hydroxyl. So that's a secondary alcohol and a nitrile on the same carbon.

Hmm, how to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. One way is hydrolysis. But nitriles typically hydrolyze under acidic or basic conditions to give carboxylic acids or their salts.

Wait, but the starting material already has an -OH group on the same carbon as CN. So perhaps this is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But under what conditions?

Wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile (but with a benzyl group). The product is 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile becomes a COOH group.

Nitrile to carboxylic acid can be done via hydrolysis. Common reagents for this are H2O with acid (like HCl) or base (like NaOH), or under strong oxidizing conditions.

Wait, another way is using a strong acid and water. For example, HCl in aqueous conditions. So reagent B could be HCl, which would provide the acidic conditions needed for the hydrolysis.

But let me think about the exact reaction conditions. The hydrolysis of nitriles can be done in acidic or basic conditions. Using HCl (like HCl gas) in water would give a hydrochloric acid environment, which is acidic. The reaction would proceed to form the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, another strong acid like H2SO4 could be used. But looking at the options, the possible B reagents are HCl (option A), CH3COOH (option B), HCl (option C), or CH3COOH (option D).

Wait, in the options:

Option A: B is HCl
Option B: B is CH3COOH
Option C: B is HCl
Option D: B is CH3COOH

So for the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

What's the role of B in the second reaction? It's a hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid. So if it's done in an acidic aqueous solution, HCl would be a likely candidate because it's a strong acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid. Would that work? Maybe, but often, the hydrolysis of nitriles to acids is done with concentrated HCl under reflux, perhaps.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the nitrile is converted to an amide first, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid, so direct hydrolysis is more likely.

So for reagent B, it's HCl. Therefore, looking at the options, those where B is HCl are options A and C.

But wait, what about the first reaction? For the first reaction, A is H3O+ (like H2SO4 or HCl, but I thought H3O+ is a proton source). In the options, if A is H3O+, then the options are A or B. But in the options, the only A reagents with H3O+ are options A and B (since C and D have A as NaHSO3).

Wait, the first reaction uses NaCN and A. So for the first reaction, A must be H3O+ to provide the acid catalyst. So in the options, only options A and B have A as H3O+.

But earlier, for reagent B, we have to choose between B as HCl or CH3COOH. So the correct option must have A as H3O+ and B as HCl. Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. That fits.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. But if A is NaHSO3, that might not be the right catalyst for the first reaction.

So the correct sequence would be A = H3O+ and B=HCl. So option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (sulfuric acid, but it's a sodium salt, so in solution, it would provide H+). But in the first reaction, the catalyst is acid. So could NaHSO3 (a source of H+) be a possible reagent?

Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. It's a weaker acid than H3O+ (which is from strong acid like H2SO4 or HCl). I'm not sure if it provides enough H+ for the cyanohydrin formation. Maybe the reaction requires a stronger acid. So perhaps H3O+ is more appropriate, which would make option A the correct choice.

Wait, but the product of the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the mechanism again. The ketone is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and acid. The mechanism would be the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon positively polarized. Then CN- attacks, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, which then loses water (with the proton from the acid) to form the cyanohydrin.

So yes, the acid is needed as a catalyst, so A is H3O+. So options A and B have A as H3O+.

Now, the second reaction, reagent B is HCl or CH3COOH. The reaction is a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Which requires more acidic conditions. So HCl is more likely, making option A correct.

Wait, but what about the hydroxyl group in the starting material of the second reaction? It's 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when the nitrile is hydrolyzed to the acid, the position of the hydroxyl would change. Wait, no, the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the nitrile. So when the nitrile group is converted to COOH, the structure becomes 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, which is correct.

So for the second reaction, using HCl would be the right approach because it provides the acidic environment needed for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

So putting it together, the correct reagents are A=H3O+ and B=HCl. Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. That's correct.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, reagent A must be an acid catalyst. H₃O⁺ (option A and B) is a suitable choice, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions. NaHSO₃ (option C and D) is less likely because it is not commonly used for this type of reaction.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This process typically requires acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, HCl (option A and C) is the most appropriate reagent, as it provides the strong acidic environment needed for the hydrolysis. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH, option B and D) is a weak acid and less effective for this reaction.

Combining these observations, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which corresponds to option A.
