Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions related to plant resistance against a fungal disease. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They did an experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to anthracnose resistance. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants and double mutants. The results are given as the resistance percentages compared to the wild-type control.

The question is about figuring out the gene interactions based on the resistance levels of the mutants.

So, what's the data again?

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than control, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% resistance (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% (much worse)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

I remember that when a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests epistasis. Epistasis is when one gene's effect masks another. So for example, if the double mutant g2g3 has the same resistance as g2 and g2g3 (both 0%), that suggests that G2 is epistatic over G3, or vice versa.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The resistance levels: the higher the number, the more resistant. So lower numbers mean more susceptible.

In the case of g2g3 and g2, both are 0%. So the double mutant doesn't get any worse than the single mutant g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over G3. Because whether you have G3 or not, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is gone. So G2 is epistatic. Because if G3 was epistatic, then in the double mutant, you might see a different effect.

Wait, another way: epistasis hierarchy. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then A is downstream. So if a double mutant has the same phenotype as A, then A is epistatic.

So looking at the data:

g2 is 0%, and the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are also 0%. So, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, and regardless of what else is knocked out, it's still 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because the presence of G2's knockout masks the effect of the other genes.

Wait, but wait: G2's single mutant is 0%, and the double mutants with G2 are also 0%. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream of both? Or upstream?

Wait, according to the question, at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So the transcription factor is likely regulating the others.

If G2 is epistatic, maybe it's downstream because if G2 is nonfunctional, the pathway can't proceed regardless of the upstream genes.

Let me think about the model. Suppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes. Suppose G1 and G3 are target genes that contribute to resistance. If G2 is knocked out, then none of the downstream genes can be activated, leading to no resistance. So g2 would have 0% resistance, and any double mutant involving G2 would also be 0%.

Hmm, that fits with the data. So G2 is the transcription factor, acting upstream of G1 and G3.

Then, what about the other genes? Let's look at the single mutants.

g1 is 75% resistance. So the resistance is reduced but not gone. g3 is 50% resistance. That suggests that each of these genes contributes some level of resistance when knocked out.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%, which is the lowest so far. If these two genes are in the same pathway, knocking both out would lead to additive or synergistic effects. But wait, if G2 is a transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. But in the g1g3 mutant, what's happening?

Wait, if G1 and G3 are both targets of G2, then in the absence of G2 (g2), both are not working. But in the absence of G2 and G3 (g2g3), it's same as g2, which makes sense.

But what about the g1g3 double mutant? The resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops more than either alone.

Wait, but that's confusing because if G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are both downstream, then the presence of G1 and G3 would contribute to resistance, but without G2, they can't be activated. So in the double mutant g1g3, if G2 is functional, perhaps G1 and G3 are both active. But wait, no, because in the data, in the single mutants, G1 is 75% and G3 is 50%. So maybe when G1 is knocked out, the other (G3) is still functional. And vice versa.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance, but both are activated by G2. So without G2, both are off, hence 0% resistance. Without G1, G3 is still on, so 50% (since G3 is half). Without G3, G1 is still on (75%). 

But wait the data says when G3 is single mutant, resistance is 50%, and G1 is 75%. So perhaps G3 contributes more to resistance than G1?

Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Because 75% is better than 50%. So when G1 is knocked out, the remaining G3 provides 75% of control? Or maybe it's additive. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The knockout's resistance is compared to wild type. So when G1 is knocked out, the plant's resistance is 75% of control. So it's less resistant than wild type. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, 50% resistance.

So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% of control. That's worse than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower. That suggests that G1 and G3 are additive in their contribution to resistance. So without either, the resistance is worse.

But how does this relate to the epistatic relationships?

Earlier, I thought that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 is downstream. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so resistance is 0%. 

Thus, the g2 mutant is 0%, and the double mutants with g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0%. 

In the single mutants, when only G1 or G3 is knocked out, the other can still contribute. So in g1, G3 is active, providing 50% resistance (since G3 alone gives 50%). Wait, but g1 has 75% resistance. Hmm, that's not matching. Because if g1 is knocked out, G3 should be active, giving 50%, but the observed resistance is 75%. 

Wait, that's a problem. So if G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then in the single mutant g1, G2 should still be active, so G3 should be active. So the resistance should be the same as G3's single mutant, which is 50%. But in the data, g1 is 75%. That's higher than G3's 50%.

Hmm, this suggests that my initial assumption might be wrong. Maybe G1 is a transcription factor instead of G2?

Wait, let's think differently. Let's consider the epistatic relationships.

The double mutants g2g3 and g1g2 are 0%, same as g2. So g2 is epistatic over g3 and g1. That suggests that G2 is downstream. Because if G2 is epistatic, then it’s the later gene in the pathway. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So if G2 is downstream, it's possible that G1 and G3 are upstream, perhaps both activating G2. So both G1 and G3 are required for G2 expression.

But then, in the single mutants, g1 would have G2 active (since only G1 is knocked out), so the plant would have resistance as G2 is functional. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is lower than control. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Or maybe G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe G2 is a transcription factor that is regulated by both G1 and G3. So if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G2 can't be activated, leading to 0% resistance. But if only one is knocked out, G2 can still be activated by the other.

Wait, but looking at the data, in the single mutants:

g1: 75% → if G1 is knocked out, then G2 can't be activated, right? So resistance would be low. But if G2 is a transcription factor, and without it, resistance is 0%, but in g1, it's 75%. That's higher than 0%, so maybe G2 isn't the only factor in resistance. Alternatively, there are other pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both transcription factors that activate a common target, which is G2. So if either G1 or G3 is present, G2 can be activated. But if both are knocked out, G2 can't be activated, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g2 is 0%. So without G1, the resistance is 75% (so G2 is active?), but that's less than control. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes (maybe G1 and G3 are target genes). So without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So in g2, no G1 and G3, so resistance is 0%. 

But in g1, G2 is active, so G3 is active, giving 50% resistance. But according to the data, g1 is 75%—so that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe G2 is a transcription factor for G1, and G1 is a transcription factor for G3. So G2 activates G1, which activates G3. So if G2 is knocked out, G1 is not expressed, so G3 isn't either.

Looking at the data:

g2: 0% → makes sense as G1 and G3 are not expressed.

g1: 75% → G1 is knocked out, so G3 isn't expressed. So why is resistance 75%? Maybe G2 is active, but without G1, G3 is not active. But without G3, perhaps G1's product is not enough for full resistance, leading to less resistance than control. Hmm, but without G1, G2 might still be active, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2 (g2), G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. In the absence of G1 (g1), G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed, so resistance is 50% (since G3's knockout is 50%). But wait, in the data, g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The data is:

g1: 75%

g2: 0%

g3: 50%

g1g3: 10%

g2g3: 0%

g1g2: 0%

So in the double mutants, when G2 is absent (g2), regardless of the other mutations, the resistance is 0%. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So G2 is downstream.

So the pathway probably is G1 and G3 → G2 → something else.

But then, in the single mutants, why is g1 75%? If G1 is knocked out, and G2 is still active, because G3 is present. So G2 is active, but maybe the product of G2 is enough for 75% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, the presence of G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance. So when G2 is not present, regardless of other genes, resistance is gone.

So pathway-wise, maybe G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. So G2 is a transcription factor activated by both G1 and G3. So if either G1 or G3 is present, G2 is expressed, allowing some resistance. But if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G2 isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, because if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 wouldn't be expressed, so resistance should be 0%. But according to data, it's 10%, which is worse than either single mutant.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that both activates G1 and G3. So without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But if G2 is present, then G1 and G3 are expressed. So in the single mutants:

g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. G3's knockout is 50%, so why is g1 at 75%? That doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are not directly activated by G2, but both are part of the same pathway as G2. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that is redundant with either G1 or G3.

Wait, perhaps G2 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, and G1 is another. Let me think.

Another approach: looking for epistatic relationships.

The epistatic gene is the one whose mutation masks the effect of another gene. So, if the double mutant of G1 and G2 is 0%, same as G2, then G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, the double mutant of G2 and G3 is 0%, same as G2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream.

So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So G2 is epistatic to both. So G2 is acting downstream of G1 and G3.

Therefore, G2 is the last gene in the pathway.

Which suggests that G2 is a transcription factor that is involved in the final steps of the resistance pathway. So if G2 is knocked out, resistance is completely lost.

In the single mutants:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So even without G1, the plant is still somewhat resistant. So G1 is not essential for resistance, but contributes to it.

- g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the plant has half the resistance of wild-type.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So the effect is additive, meaning G1 and G3 contribute additively to the resistance. But without G2, the resistance is 0%.

So the hierarchy is G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream.

Now, which gene is the transcription factor? The question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it's acting upstream, activating other genes. But earlier, I thought G2 is downstream. Wait, no. Transcription factors are usually upstream, activating other genes. So if G2 is a transcription factor, it would activate downstream genes, like G1 and G3.

But then, based on the epistasis, G2 is downstream. So that would be a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me think again. If G2 is a transcription factor (upstream), then it would regulate G1 and G3.

But in the data, the double mutants involving G2 have the same phenotype as G2. So if G2 is epistatic, that would mean that G2 is downstream. Because when G2 is knocked out, the downstream effect is masked.

Ah, so if G2 is a transcription factor (upstream) activating G1 and G3, then G2's mutation would cause G1 and G3 not to be expressed. So in that scenario, the single mutant g2 would have 0% resistance (correct). The single mutants g1 and g3 would have some resistance because the other gene is active.

Wait, but in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then without G2, both are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

So in the single mutants, when G1 is knocked out but G2 is present, G3 is expressed. So resistance is determined by G3's product. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. If G3 is present, why isn't the resistance the same as G3 (50%)?

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor for another gene, say, G4, which is involved in resistance. But then the data doesn't mention G4. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have their own functions beyond just being under G2's regulation.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are both transcription factors as well, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is in a different pathway. Let me see.

Looking back at the data:

In g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is the lowest. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that contribute to resistance. So their combined knockout leads to additive effects.

But how does G2 fit into this? Since G2's mutation leads to 0% resistance, regardless of other mutations, G2 is the key.

If G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But in the single mutants, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed and vice versa.

So the resistance in g1 would be due to G3's expression, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. How is that possible?

Alternatively, maybe the resistance is due to another pathway when G2 is not present. But that complicates things.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

If G2 is epistatic towards G1, then in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance would be the same as g2, which is 0% (matches data). So that's correct. But if G1 is a TF, then G1 would be upstream. But in that case, why is g2 0%? Because if G2 is downstream, and G1 is upstream, then knocking out G2 would lead to 0% resistance regardless of G1's status. So that fits the data. But the option says that G2 shows pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. So if G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, that might not directly explain the data. I'm not sure.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it would be upstream. G1 and G3 having same promoter suggests that G2 activates both. If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So this wouldn't fit. So option B is not correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1. Data: g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that doesn't fit. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g1. But in data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1. So that's not matching. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought earlier that G2 is a TF, so perhaps that's the case.

Looking at the options, only option A has G2 as epistatic. Let me read option A again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, if G2 is epistatic towards G1, then in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is same as g2 (0%). Which matches the data. Also, if G2 is epistatic, then G2 is downstream of G1.

But the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So if G1 is a TF (as per option A), then it's upstream of G2 and G3. But then, the single mutant g2 has 0% resistance. So if G1 is a TF, and G2 is downstream, then without G1, G2 wouldn't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. That's a contradiction. So option A can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

If G2 is the transcription factor (as in option B, C, D), then G2 is upstream, activating G1 and G3.

In that case, the single mutant g2 would have 0% resistance because G1 and G3 are not expressed. That matches the data.

The single mutants g1 and g3 would have some resistance, because the other gene is expressed. So in g1, G3 is expressed (50% resistance), but according to the data, g1 is 75% resistance. That's higher than G3's 50%. Hmm, that's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 have additive effects when both are present. So when G2 is active, both G1 and G3 are expressed. So without G2, both are off (g2 is 0%). Without G1, G3 is on (50%). Without G3, G1 is on (75%). So in the double mutant g1g3, both are off, but wait, that's only possible if G2 is knocked out. But in this case, the double mutant g1g3 would have G2 still active. So it would have the same resistance as wild-type? But data shows 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, their combined absence leads to a more severe phenotype. But why would that be the case if G2 is active? It shouldn't, because G2 would still be activating other genes. Unless G1 and G3 have other functions beyond being downstream of G2.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for G2's function. But that would mean that in the absence of either, G2 isn't expressed. But in the data, the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance, which would imply that G2 is still expressed.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model this.

If G2 is the transcription factor, then it activates G1 and G3. So in the mutant g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed → 0% resistance.

In g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed → resistance is determined by G3's function. If G3 is 50% when knocked out, but when G1 is knocked out, G3 is active. So why is g1 75%?

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 contribute in a non-additive way. For example, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So when both are present, the total is 75%. But when only G3 is present (g1 mutant), the resistance is 50% (the same as G3's knockout). But according to data, g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of G1 and G3 each add 25% and 50% respectively. So in wild-type, total is 75% + 50% = 125%? That doesn't make sense because the control is 100%. So maybe it's normalized differently.

Hmm, perhaps the model is that G2 is the main transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are secondary. So without G2, nothing works. Without G1, G3 is active and provides some resistance. Without G3, G1 is active and provides more resistance. When both are knocked out, but G2 is active, both G1 and G3 are present (so maximum resistance). But that's not the case here.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy means that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So if one is knocked out, the other can take over. So in the double mutant, both are knocked out, so resistance drops.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is much lower than either single mutant. So that's worse than either, which would fit redundancy. But then, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g1. But in data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that doesn't fit. So option D is incorrect.

So, back to the options.

Looking again, the only option that fits the data with G2 being epistatic is option A, but that would require G1 being a TF. But that may conflict.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about epistasis. If G2 is epistatic to G1, then the pathway is G1 → G2 → something. So G2 is downstream. So in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% (same as g2), which fits the data.

But if G1 is a TF, then in the single mutant g1, resistance should be less than wild-type. The data says g1 is 75% resistance. So in that case, the plant is still somewhat resistant when G1 is knocked out. That suggests that G1 is not the only TF. Maybe G2 is the TF, acting downstream, but another gene is also contributing.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me think step by step.

The key is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream.

In the single mutants:

g1 → 75% → so G2 is active, providing some resistance.

g2 → 0% → G2 is knocked out, so no resistance.

g3 →50% → G2 is active, providing 50% resistance.

In the double mutants:

g1g2 → 0% → same as g2.

g2g3 → 0% → same as g2.

g1g3 →10% → which is lower than either single mutant.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, when G2 is functional, resistance is 10%. That suggests that without G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%, which is less than either G1 or G3's single effect.

Hmm, but if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are targets, then when G2 is present, in g1g3, G2 is active, but G1 and G3 are not. So why is resistance 10%? Maybe because there's another gene downstream that's partially active.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have functions beyond being targets of G2. Maybe they're in a parallel pathway.

Wait, perhaps the model is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are part of a resistance pathway. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed. If G3 is knocked out, G1 is expressed.

In the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than G3's 50%. So perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. Or perhaps G1 and G3 have other functions.

Wait, another angle: Let's look at the double mutant g1g3 of 10%. If G2 is active, then G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 10% resistance. But why 10%? Maybe because another gene, say G4, is providing that resistance. But since the data doesn't mention G4, this might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, but in a way that their absence leads to a more severe phenotype. But I'm not sure.

Putting all together, the only option that matches the data is where G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, acting as a transcription factor (so upstream). The single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance (75% and 50%) because their downstream genes (G2) are active, but perhaps their own products contribute additional resistance. The option that best fits this is option A or D.

Wait, looking at option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, the double mutant would have the same resistance as G1. But in data, it's 10%, which is worse. So option C is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But earlier, I thought that if G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream, which would require G1 to be upstream. But if G1 is a TF, then G1 acts upstream. So in that scenario, G2 is downstream, meaning that G2's mutation masks the effect of G1.

So when G1 is knocked out, G2 is still active, but the resistance is 75%. When G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, irrespective of G1.

But why is the resistance 75% in g1? Because G2 is active, so perhaps G2's product provides 75% resistance on its own. But then why is the wild-type 100%? Because in wild-type, both G1 and G2 are active. So G1 might provide an additional 25% resistance.

So in g1, only G2 is active, giving 75% resistance. In g2, neither G1 nor G2 are active (wait no, G2 is knocked out), so resistance is 0%. In g3, G2 is active (since G3 is knocked out), providing 75%, but data says g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps this is not the right approach. Let me think about the answer options again.

The correct conclusion must align with G2 being epistatic, which is in option A and others.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1.

So G2 being epistatic to G1 would mean that G2 is downstream. So the pathway is G1 → G2.

In the data, the single mutant g1 has 75% resistance. So perhaps G2 is active, providing 75% resistance. But why is the wild-type 100%? Because G1 and G2 are both active, so G1 provides an additional 25%?

When G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%. So without G2, even if G1 is active, there's no resistance.

In g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So if G1 is a TF, and G3's mutation doesn't affect it, but perhaps G3 is another gene downstream of G2, so when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 is active but without G3, it can't function. So resistance is 10%.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2. So without G2, both are inactive. But in single mutants, G1 or G3 can be active, providing some resistance.

But the data for g1 is 75%, which is higher than the 50% of g3. So perhaps G1 provides more resistance than G3. So in the double mutant, when both are knocked out but G2 is active, the resistance is additive, but why 10%? That's the part I'm not getting.

I think I'm going in circles. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The key points are:

- G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

- G2 is likely the transcription factor, acting upstream.

- G1 and G3 are additive in their contributions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. Doesn't fit because if G1 is TF, g1 should have lower resistance.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so both activated by G2). G3 epistatic to G1. But if G3 is epistatic, then in double mutant g1g3, resistance would be same as G3, which is 50%. Data shows 10%, so no.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic to G3. So in double mutant, same as G1: 75%, but data is 10%.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant. G1 is epistatic to G3. Redundancy would mean that knocking out both would have the same as the single. But data shows worse than single, so no.

Hmm, none of the options seem to fit perfectly, but option C and D seem less likely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another thought. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. So G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their combined knockout leads to a worse phenotype. But if they were redundant, the double would be same as single, which is not the case.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So each contributes to resistance. So without G1, G3's pathway is active (50%). Without G3, G1's pathway is active (75%). Without both, neither pathway is active, leading to 10% (maybe another minor pathway). But that doesn't fit with the data because the double mutant is 10% while without G2, it's 0%.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, if G2 is active, then why is resistance only 10%? Maybe because they're both required for G2's function. So without either, G2 isn't fully functional, even though G2 is active.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that requires either G1 or G3 to function. So in the absence of both, G2 can't function, leading to 0% resistance. But the data for g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So that doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck. Let me think about which option matches G2 being epistatic and a transcription factor.

Only option B and D have G2 as TF. Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. But the data shows that the double mutants involving G2 are 0%, so G2 is epistatic. So option B is incorrect because it suggests G3 is epistatic.

So the only option left is option A or D. Wait, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Redundancy implies that knocking out both doesn't decrease resistance beyond the single. But data says g1g3 is 10%, worse than either, so redundancy isn't the case. So option D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the confusion. Because G2 is epistatic, and G1 is a TF upstream. But I'm not sure.

The experiment investigates the interactions of three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The resistance data for single and double mutants is as follows:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**:  
   - The double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3** both show 0% resistance, matching the resistance level of **g2**. This indicates that G2 is downstream and masks the effects of G1 and G3 when knocked out.

2. **G1 and G3 contribute additively**:  
   - The double mutant **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (**g1: 75%, g3: 50%**). This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance.

3. **G2 is likely a transcription factor**:  
   - The question states that at least one gene acts as a transcription factor upstream of others. Given that G2 is epistatic and its knockout eliminates all resistance, G2 is likely the transcription factor regulating downstream genes like G1 and G3.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.  
  - If G1 were a transcription factor, its knockout (**g1**) should result in 0% resistance, as it would fail to activate downstream genes. However, **g1** shows 75% resistance, contradicting this option.

- **Option B**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.  
  - If G3 were epistatic, the double mutant **g1g3** would have the same resistance as **g3** (50%). However, **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, ruling out this option.

- **Option C**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.  
  - If G1 were epistatic, the double mutant **g1g3** would have the same resistance as **g1** (75%). However, **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, contradicting this option.

- **Option D**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.  
  - If G1 and G3 were redundant, the double mutant **g1g3** would have the same resistance as either single mutant. However, **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, ruling out redundancy.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that **G2 is a transcription factor** and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The single mutants **g1** and **g3** show partial resistance, indicating that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance. The double mutant **g1g3** shows the lowest resistance (10%), suggesting additive effects. Among the options, **Option A** aligns best with the data, despite some ambiguities in interpretation.

Answer: A

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions related to plant resistance against a fungal disease. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the setup: They did an experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to anthracnose resistance. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants and double mutants. The results are given as the resistance percentages compared to the wild-type control.

The question is about figuring out the gene interactions based on the resistance levels of the mutants.

So, what's the data again?

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than control, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% resistance (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% (much worse)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

I remember that when a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests epistasis. Epistasis is when one gene's effect masks another. So for example, if the double mutant g2g3 has the same resistance as g2 and g2g3 (both 0%), that suggests that G2 is epistatic over G3, or vice versa.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The resistance levels: the higher the number, the more resistant. So lower numbers mean more susceptible.

In the case of g2g3 and g2, both are 0%. So the double mutant doesn't get any worse than the single mutant g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over G3. Because whether you have G3 or not, when G2 is knocked out, resistance is gone. So G2 is epistatic. Because if G3 was epistatic, then in the double mutant, you might see a different effect.

Wait, another way: epistasis hierarchy. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then A is downstream. So if a double mutant has the same phenotype as A, then A is epistatic.

So looking at the data:

g2 is 0%, and the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 are also 0%. So, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, and regardless of what else is knocked out, it's still 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because the presence of G2's knockout masks the effect of the other genes.

Wait, but wait: G2's single mutant is 0%, and the double mutants with G2 are also 0%. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream of both? Or upstream?

Wait, according to the question, at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So the transcription factor is likely regulating the others.

If G2 is epistatic, maybe it's downstream because if G2 is nonfunctional, the pathway can't proceed regardless of the upstream genes.

Let me think about the model. Suppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes. Suppose G1 and G3 are target genes that contribute to resistance. If G2 is knocked out, then none of the downstream genes can be activated, leading to no resistance. So g2 would have 0% resistance, and any double mutant involving G2 would also be 0%.

Hmm, that fits with the data. So G2 is the transcription factor, acting upstream of G1 and G3.

Then, what about the other genes? Let's look at the single mutants.

g1 is 75% resistance. So the resistance is reduced but not gone. g3 is 50% resistance. That suggests that each of these genes contributes some level of resistance when knocked out.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%, which is the lowest so far. If these two genes are in the same pathway, knocking both out would lead to additive or synergistic effects. But wait, if G2 is a transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both are inactive, leading to 0% resistance. But in the g1g3 mutant, what's happening?

Wait, if G1 and G3 are both targets of G2, then in the absence of G2 (g2), both are not working. But in the absence of G2 and G3 (g2g3), it's same as g2, which makes sense.

But what about the g1g3 double mutant? The resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops more than either alone.

Wait, but that's confusing because if G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are both downstream, then the presence of G1 and G3 would contribute to resistance, but without G2, they can't be activated. So in the double mutant g1g3, if G2 is functional, perhaps G1 and G3 are both active. But wait, no, because in the data, in the single mutants, G1 is 75% and G3 is 50%. So maybe when G1 is knocked out, the other (G3) is still functional. And vice versa.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance, but both are activated by G2. So without G2, both are off, hence 0% resistance. Without G1, G3 is still on, so 50% (since G3 is half). Without G3, G1 is still on (75%). 

But wait the data says when G3 is single mutant, resistance is 50%, and G1 is 75%. So perhaps G3 contributes more to resistance than G1?

Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Because 75% is better than 50%. So when G1 is knocked out, the remaining G3 provides 75% of control? Or maybe it's additive. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. The knockout's resistance is compared to wild type. So when G1 is knocked out, the plant's resistance is 75% of control. So it's less resistant than wild type. Similarly, when G3 is knocked out, 50% resistance.

So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10% of control. That's worse than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is much lower. That suggests that G1 and G3 are additive in their contribution to resistance. So without either, the resistance is worse.

But how does this relate to the epistatic relationships?

Earlier, I thought that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning G2 is downstream. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, G1 and G3 can't be expressed, so resistance is 0%. 

Thus, the g2 mutant is 0%, and the double mutants with g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) are also 0%. 

In the single mutants, when only G1 or G3 is knocked out, the other can still contribute. So in g1, G3 is active, providing 50% resistance (since G3 alone gives 50%). Wait, but g1 has 75% resistance. Hmm, that's not matching. Because if g1 is knocked out, G3 should be active, giving 50%, but the observed resistance is 75%. 

Wait, that's a problem. So if G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then in the single mutant g1, G2 should still be active, so G3 should be active. So the resistance should be the same as G3's single mutant, which is 50%. But in the data, g1 is 75%. That's higher than G3's 50%.

Hmm, this suggests that my initial assumption might be wrong. Maybe G1 is a transcription factor instead of G2?

Wait, let's think differently. Let's consider the epistatic relationships.

The double mutants g2g3 and g1g2 are 0%, same as g2. So g2 is epistatic over g3 and g1. That suggests that G2 is downstream. Because if G2 is epistatic, then it’s the later gene in the pathway. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So if G2 is downstream, it's possible that G1 and G3 are upstream, perhaps both activating G2. So both G1 and G3 are required for G2 expression.

But then, in the single mutants, g1 would have G2 active (since only G1 is knocked out), so the plant would have resistance as G2 is functional. But in the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is lower than control. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Or maybe G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe G2 is a transcription factor that is regulated by both G1 and G3. So if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G2 can't be activated, leading to 0% resistance. But if only one is knocked out, G2 can still be activated by the other.

Wait, but looking at the data, in the single mutants:

g1: 75% → if G1 is knocked out, then G2 can't be activated, right? So resistance would be low. But if G2 is a transcription factor, and without it, resistance is 0%, but in g1, it's 75%. That's higher than 0%, so maybe G2 isn't the only factor in resistance. Alternatively, there are other pathways.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both transcription factors that activate a common target, which is G2. So if either G1 or G3 is present, G2 can be activated. But if both are knocked out, G2 can't be activated, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutants, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%, and g2 is 0%. So without G1, the resistance is 75% (so G2 is active?), but that's less than control. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes (maybe G1 and G3 are target genes). So without G2, G1 and G3 can't be expressed. So in g2, no G1 and G3, so resistance is 0%. 

But in g1, G2 is active, so G3 is active, giving 50% resistance. But according to the data, g1 is 75%—so that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe G2 is a transcription factor for G1, and G1 is a transcription factor for G3. So G2 activates G1, which activates G3. So if G2 is knocked out, G1 is not expressed, so G3 isn't either.

Looking at the data:

g2: 0% → makes sense as G1 and G3 are not expressed.

g1: 75% → G1 is knocked out, so G3 isn't expressed. So why is resistance 75%? Maybe G2 is active, but without G1, G3 is not active. But without G3, perhaps G1's product is not enough for full resistance, leading to less resistance than control. Hmm, but without G1, G2 might still be active, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So in the absence of G2 (g2), G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. In the absence of G1 (g1), G2 is still active, so G3 is expressed, so resistance is 50% (since G3's knockout is 50%). But wait, in the data, g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The data is:

g1: 75%

g2: 0%

g3: 50%

g1g3: 10%

g2g3: 0%

g1g2: 0%

So in the double mutants, when G2 is absent (g2), regardless of the other mutations, the resistance is 0%. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So G2 is downstream.

So the pathway probably is G1 and G3 → G2 → something else.

But then, in the single mutants, why is g1 75%? If G1 is knocked out, and G2 is still active, because G3 is present. So G2 is active, but maybe the product of G2 is enough for 75% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, the presence of G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance. So when G2 is not present, regardless of other genes, resistance is gone.

So pathway-wise, maybe G1 and G3 are upstream of G2. So G2 is a transcription factor activated by both G1 and G3. So if either G1 or G3 is present, G2 is expressed, allowing some resistance. But if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, then G2 isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

Wait, but in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, because if both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 wouldn't be expressed, so resistance should be 0%. But according to data, it's 10%, which is worse than either single mutant.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that both activates G1 and G3. So without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But if G2 is present, then G1 and G3 are expressed. So in the single mutants:

g1: G2 is present, so G3 is expressed. G3's knockout is 50%, so why is g1 at 75%? That doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are not directly activated by G2, but both are part of the same pathway as G2. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that is redundant with either G1 or G3.

Wait, perhaps G2 and G3 are in a redundant pathway, and G1 is another. Let me think.

Another approach: looking for epistatic relationships.

The epistatic gene is the one whose mutation masks the effect of another gene. So, if the double mutant of G1 and G2 is 0%, same as G2, then G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, the double mutant of G2 and G3 is 0%, same as G2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream.

So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

So G2 is epistatic to both. So G2 is acting downstream of G1 and G3.

Therefore, G2 is the last gene in the pathway.

Which suggests that G2 is a transcription factor that is involved in the final steps of the resistance pathway. So if G2 is knocked out, resistance is completely lost.

In the single mutants:

- g1 has 75% resistance. So even without G1, the plant is still somewhat resistant. So G1 is not essential for resistance, but contributes to it.

- g3 has 50% resistance. So without G3, the plant has half the resistance of wild-type.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So the effect is additive, meaning G1 and G3 contribute additively to the resistance. But without G2, the resistance is 0%.

So the hierarchy is G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream.

Now, which gene is the transcription factor? The question says that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it's acting upstream, activating other genes. But earlier, I thought G2 is downstream. Wait, no. Transcription factors are usually upstream, activating other genes. So if G2 is a transcription factor, it would activate downstream genes, like G1 and G3.

But then, based on the epistasis, G2 is downstream. So that would be a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me think again. If G2 is a transcription factor (upstream), then it would regulate G1 and G3.

But in the data, the double mutants involving G2 have the same phenotype as G2. So if G2 is epistatic, that would mean that G2 is downstream. Because when G2 is knocked out, the downstream effect is masked.

Ah, so if G2 is a transcription factor (upstream) activating G1 and G3, then G2's mutation would cause G1 and G3 not to be expressed. So in that scenario, the single mutant g2 would have 0% resistance (correct). The single mutants g1 and g3 would have some resistance because the other gene is active.

Wait, but in the data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are downstream, then without G2, both are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance.

So in the single mutants, when G1 is knocked out but G2 is present, G3 is expressed. So resistance is determined by G3's product. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. If G3 is present, why isn't the resistance the same as G3 (50%)?

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor for another gene, say, G4, which is involved in resistance. But then the data doesn't mention G4. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have their own functions beyond just being under G2's regulation.

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 are both transcription factors as well, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 and G3 are in the same pathway, and G1 is in a different pathway. Let me see.

Looking back at the data:

In g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is much lower than either single mutant. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is the lowest. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that contribute to resistance. So their combined knockout leads to additive effects.

But how does G2 fit into this? Since G2's mutation leads to 0% resistance, regardless of other mutations, G2 is the key.

If G2 is a transcription factor, perhaps it activates both G1 and G3. So without G2, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. But in the single mutants, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed and vice versa.

So the resistance in g1 would be due to G3's expression, but in the data, g1 has 75% resistance. How is that possible?

Alternatively, maybe the resistance is due to another pathway when G2 is not present. But that complicates things.

Wait, another approach: Let's look at the options.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

If G2 is epistatic towards G1, then in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance would be the same as g2, which is 0% (matches data). So that's correct. But if G1 is a TF, then G1 would be upstream. But in that case, why is g2 0%? Because if G2 is downstream, and G1 is upstream, then knocking out G2 would lead to 0% resistance regardless of G1's status. So that fits the data. But the option says that G2 shows pleiotropy. Pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. So if G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, that might not directly explain the data. I'm not sure.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it would be upstream. G1 and G3 having same promoter suggests that G2 activates both. If G3 is epistatic towards G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3. But in the data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g3's 50%. So this wouldn't fit. So option B is not correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1. Data: g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that doesn't fit. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy would mean that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g1. But in data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1. So that's not matching. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but I thought earlier that G2 is a TF, so perhaps that's the case.

Looking at the options, only option A has G2 as epistatic. Let me read option A again.

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, if G2 is epistatic towards G1, then in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is same as g2 (0%). Which matches the data. Also, if G2 is epistatic, then G2 is downstream of G1.

But the question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So if G1 is a TF (as per option A), then it's upstream of G2 and G3. But then, the single mutant g2 has 0% resistance. So if G1 is a TF, and G2 is downstream, then without G1, G2 wouldn't be expressed, leading to 0% resistance. But in the data, g1 is 75% resistance. That's a contradiction. So option A can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

If G2 is the transcription factor (as in option B, C, D), then G2 is upstream, activating G1 and G3.

In that case, the single mutant g2 would have 0% resistance because G1 and G3 are not expressed. That matches the data.

The single mutants g1 and g3 would have some resistance, because the other gene is expressed. So in g1, G3 is expressed (50% resistance), but according to the data, g1 is 75% resistance. That's higher than G3's 50%. Hmm, that's confusing. 

Wait, perhaps G1 and G3 have additive effects when both are present. So when G2 is active, both G1 and G3 are expressed. So without G2, both are off (g2 is 0%). Without G1, G3 is on (50%). Without G3, G1 is on (75%). So in the double mutant g1g3, both are off, but wait, that's only possible if G2 is knocked out. But in this case, the double mutant g1g3 would have G2 still active. So it would have the same resistance as wild-type? But data shows 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, their combined absence leads to a more severe phenotype. But why would that be the case if G2 is active? It shouldn't, because G2 would still be activating other genes. Unless G1 and G3 have other functions beyond being downstream of G2.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are both required for G2's function. But that would mean that in the absence of either, G2 isn't expressed. But in the data, the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance, which would imply that G2 is still expressed.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to model this.

If G2 is the transcription factor, then it activates G1 and G3. So in the mutant g2, G1 and G3 are not expressed → 0% resistance.

In g1 mutant, G2 is active, so G3 is expressed → resistance is determined by G3's function. If G3 is 50% when knocked out, but when G1 is knocked out, G3 is active. So why is g1 75%?

Wait, maybe G1 and G3 contribute in a non-additive way. For example, G1 contributes 25% and G3 contributes 50%. So when both are present, the total is 75%. But when only G3 is present (g1 mutant), the resistance is 50% (the same as G3's knockout). But according to data, g1 is 75%. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of G1 and G3 each add 25% and 50% respectively. So in wild-type, total is 75% + 50% = 125%? That doesn't make sense because the control is 100%. So maybe it's normalized differently.

Hmm, perhaps the model is that G2 is the main transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are secondary. So without G2, nothing works. Without G1, G3 is active and provides some resistance. Without G3, G1 is active and provides more resistance. When both are knocked out, but G2 is active, both G1 and G3 are present (so maximum resistance). But that's not the case here.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy means that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other. So if one is knocked out, the other can take over. So in the double mutant, both are knocked out, so resistance drops.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10% resistance, which is much lower than either single mutant. So that's worse than either, which would fit redundancy. But then, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g1. But in data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that doesn't fit. So option D is incorrect.

So, back to the options.

Looking again, the only option that fits the data with G2 being epistatic is option A, but that would require G1 being a TF. But that may conflict.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking about epistasis. If G2 is epistatic to G1, then the pathway is G1 → G2 → something. So G2 is downstream. So in the double mutant g1g2, the resistance is 0% (same as g2), which fits the data.

But if G1 is a TF, then in the single mutant g1, resistance should be less than wild-type. The data says g1 is 75% resistance. So in that case, the plant is still somewhat resistant when G1 is knocked out. That suggests that G1 is not the only TF. Maybe G2 is the TF, acting downstream, but another gene is also contributing.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me think step by step.

The key is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is downstream.

In the single mutants:

g1 → 75% → so G2 is active, providing some resistance.

g2 → 0% → G2 is knocked out, so no resistance.

g3 →50% → G2 is active, providing 50% resistance.

In the double mutants:

g1g2 → 0% → same as g2.

g2g3 → 0% → same as g2.

g1g3 →10% → which is lower than either single mutant.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, when G2 is functional, resistance is 10%. That suggests that without G1 and G3, the resistance is 10%, which is less than either G1 or G3's single effect.

Hmm, but if G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are targets, then when G2 is present, in g1g3, G2 is active, but G1 and G3 are not. So why is resistance 10%? Maybe because there's another gene downstream that's partially active.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 have functions beyond being targets of G2. Maybe they're in a parallel pathway.

Wait, perhaps the model is that G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are part of a resistance pathway. So in the absence of G2, G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is knocked out, G3 is expressed. If G3 is knocked out, G1 is expressed.

In the data, g1 has 75% resistance, which is higher than G3's 50%. So perhaps G1 contributes more to resistance than G3. Or perhaps G1 and G3 have other functions.

Wait, another angle: Let's look at the double mutant g1g3 of 10%. If G2 is active, then G1 and G3 are not expressed, leading to 10% resistance. But why 10%? Maybe because another gene, say G4, is providing that resistance. But since the data doesn't mention G4, this might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 contribute to the same pathway, but in a way that their absence leads to a more severe phenotype. But I'm not sure.

Putting all together, the only option that matches the data is where G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, acting as a transcription factor (so upstream). The single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance (75% and 50%) because their downstream genes (G2) are active, but perhaps their own products contribute additional resistance. The option that best fits this is option A or D.

Wait, looking at option C: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But in the data, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, the double mutant would have the same resistance as G1. But in data, it's 10%, which is worse. So option C is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But earlier, I thought that if G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream, which would require G1 to be upstream. But if G1 is a TF, then G1 acts upstream. So in that scenario, G2 is downstream, meaning that G2's mutation masks the effect of G1.

So when G1 is knocked out, G2 is still active, but the resistance is 75%. When G2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%, irrespective of G1.

But why is the resistance 75% in g1? Because G2 is active, so perhaps G2's product provides 75% resistance on its own. But then why is the wild-type 100%? Because in wild-type, both G1 and G2 are active. So G1 might provide an additional 25% resistance.

So in g1, only G2 is active, giving 75% resistance. In g2, neither G1 nor G2 are active (wait no, G2 is knocked out), so resistance is 0%. In g3, G2 is active (since G3 is knocked out), providing 75%, but data says g3 is 50%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps this is not the right approach. Let me think about the answer options again.

The correct conclusion must align with G2 being epistatic, which is in option A and others.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G2 is epistatic towards G1.

So G2 being epistatic to G1 would mean that G2 is downstream. So the pathway is G1 → G2.

In the data, the single mutant g1 has 75% resistance. So perhaps G2 is active, providing 75% resistance. But why is the wild-type 100%? Because G1 and G2 are both active, so G1 provides an additional 25%?

When G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%. So without G2, even if G1 is active, there's no resistance.

In g1g3, the resistance is 10%. So if G1 is a TF, and G3's mutation doesn't affect it, but perhaps G3 is another gene downstream of G2, so when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, G2 is active but without G3, it can't function. So resistance is 10%.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2. So without G2, both are inactive. But in single mutants, G1 or G3 can be active, providing some resistance.

But the data for g1 is 75%, which is higher than the 50% of g3. So perhaps G1 provides more resistance than G3. So in the double mutant, when both are knocked out but G2 is active, the resistance is additive, but why 10%? That's the part I'm not getting.

I think I'm going in circles. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the data.

The key points are:

- G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

- G2 is likely the transcription factor, acting upstream.

- G1 and G3 are additive in their contributions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. Doesn't fit because if G1 is TF, g1 should have lower resistance.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so both activated by G2). G3 epistatic to G1. But if G3 is epistatic, then in double mutant g1g3, resistance would be same as G3, which is 50%. Data shows 10%, so no.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 is epistatic to G3. So in double mutant, same as G1: 75%, but data is 10%.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant. G1 is epistatic to G3. Redundancy would mean that knocking out both would have the same as the single. But data shows worse than single, so no.

Hmm, none of the options seem to fit perfectly, but option C and D seem less likely.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another thought. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single. So G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their combined knockout leads to a worse phenotype. But if they were redundant, the double would be same as single, which is not the case.

Alternatively, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So each contributes to resistance. So without G1, G3's pathway is active (50%). Without G3, G1's pathway is active (75%). Without both, neither pathway is active, leading to 10% (maybe another minor pathway). But that doesn't fit with the data because the double mutant is 10% while without G2, it's 0%.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, if G2 is active, then why is resistance only 10%? Maybe because they're both required for G2's function. So without either, G2 isn't fully functional, even though G2 is active.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that requires either G1 or G3 to function. So in the absence of both, G2 can't function, leading to 0% resistance. But the data for g1g3 is 10%, not 0%. So that doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck. Let me think about which option matches G2 being epistatic and a transcription factor.

Only option B and D have G2 as TF. Option B says G3 is epistatic to G1. But the data shows that the double mutants involving G2 are 0%, so G2 is epistatic. So option B is incorrect because it suggests G3 is epistatic.

So the only option left is option A or D. Wait, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Redundancy implies that knocking out both doesn't decrease resistance beyond the single. But data says g1g3 is 10%, worse than either, so redundancy isn't the case. So option D is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the confusion. Because G2 is epistatic, and G1 is a TF upstream. But I'm not sure.


The experiment investigates the interactions of three candidate genes (G1, G2, G3) in white lupine resistance to anthracnose. The resistance data for single and double mutants is as follows:

- **g1**: 75% resistance  
- **g2**: 0% resistance  
- **g3**: 50% resistance  
- **g1g3**: 10% resistance  
- **g2g3**: 0% resistance  
- **g1g2**: 0% resistance  

### Key Observations:
1. **G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3**:  
   - The double mutants **g1g2** and **g2g3** both show 0% resistance, matching the resistance level of **g2**. This indicates that G2 is downstream and masks the effects of G1 and G3 when knocked out.

2. **G1 and G3 contribute additively**:  
   - The double mutant **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant (**g1: 75%, g3: 50%**). This suggests that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance.

3. **G2 is likely a transcription factor**:  
   - The question states that at least one gene acts as a transcription factor upstream of others. Given that G2 is epistatic and its knockout eliminates all resistance, G2 is likely the transcription factor regulating downstream genes like G1 and G3.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.  
  - If G1 were a transcription factor, its knockout (**g1**) should result in 0% resistance, as it would fail to activate downstream genes. However, **g1** shows 75% resistance, contradicting this option.

- **Option B**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.  
  - If G3 were epistatic, the double mutant **g1g3** would have the same resistance as **g3** (50%). However, **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, ruling out this option.

- **Option C**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.  
  - If G1 were epistatic, the double mutant **g1g3** would have the same resistance as **g1** (75%). However, **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, contradicting this option.

- **Option D**: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.  
  - If G1 and G3 were redundant, the double mutant **g1g3** would have the same resistance as either single mutant. However, **g1g3** shows 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant, ruling out redundancy.

### Conclusion:
The data strongly supports that **G2 is a transcription factor** and is epistatic to both G1 and G3. The single mutants **g1** and **g3** show partial resistance, indicating that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance. The double mutant **g1g3** shows the lowest resistance (10%), suggesting additive effects. Among the options, **Option A** aligns best with the data, despite some ambiguities in interpretation.
