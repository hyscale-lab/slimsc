Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Oh right, it's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution made by mixing two phosphoric acid salts. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion, right?

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

Wait, I think I need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in this solution. But wait, when you mix these two salts, what happens? Both are related to the phosphate ion, so maybe they form a buffer solution. Let me think. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So when they're both in solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions are present. 

Wait, but in water, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The H3PO4 can lose protons stepwise:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, in solution, the phosphate species will depend on the pH. Since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively, this mixture should form a buffer. Buffer solutions are made from a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. 

In this case, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (but wait, is H2PO4^- an acid or a base? Since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, it's acting as an acid. Alternatively, it can accept a proton to become H3PO4, so it's a base as well. So in this case, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. 

So the solution is a buffer solution consisting of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. To find the concentration of HPO4^2-, we need to determine the pH of the solution first, because the concentration of HPO4^2- depends on the pH. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2- because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to form HPO4^2-. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is approximately 7.207, right? Let me calculate that: log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → 0.7924 -8 → -7.2076? Wait, wait. No, wait: 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8, so the pKa is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that: log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 0.792 makes the log(6.2e-8) = 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa is 7.208.

Wait, no. Wait, pKa = -log(Ka). So for Ka2 = 6.2e-8, pKa2 is 7.207, because 10^(-7.207) ≈ 6.2e-8.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, how do I find the pH here? Alternatively, maybe I can find the concentrations of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, then use the equation to find the ratio, and then find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution's pH is determined by the buffer. So we need to find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] based on their concentrations in the solution.

Wait, another approach: when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base (or vice versa), the ratio of the concentrations determines the pH. So in this case, the buffer consists of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So the initial moles of each can be calculated, and then their ratio can be used in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So first, calculate the moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass (g) / molecular weight (g/mol) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but for each mole of KH2PO4, how much H2PO4^- is produced? Each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, the solution has 0.007345 mol H2PO4^- and 0.005613 mol HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So to get concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.

Wait, but so the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028065 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7645.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] )

So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.7645).

What's log(0.7645)? Well, log(0.7) is about -0.155, log(0.75)= approx -0.1249, log(0.7645)= let me compute it more accurately.

Using calculator: 0.7645.

Hmm, log(0.7645) ≈ log(7.645e-1) = log(7.645) + log(1e-1) → log(7.645)=0.884 (since 10^0.884≈7.645), so 0.884 -1 = -0.116. Alternatively, I can remember that log(0.76)= about -0.117, so 0.7645 is a bit higher, say log(0.7645)= -0.115.

So pH = 7.207 + (-0.115) = 7.092.

Wait, but wait—this pH is around 7.09. Now, how does this help me find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Because the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the ratio of their concentrations is determined by the pH. But I think I already used that to find the pH. Hmm, perhaps I'm going in circles here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the moles and then relate that to the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- would depend on the pH. Because HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

But in the buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are fixed by the amounts of the two salts we added, right? Because the buffer resists pH change when small amounts of acid or base are added, but in this case, the initial concentrations are from the salts.

Wait, but wait, perhaps that's not the case. Because the buffer solution's pH is determined by the ratio of the two salts. So when you have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by that ratio.

But in reality, the pH of the solution will adjust based on that ratio, and in that solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be in a ratio determined by the buffer equation.

Wait a minute, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. So the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- come from the two salts. The total volume is 0.2 L. So their concentrations are 0.036725 M and 0.028065 M, respectively.

But when dissolved in water, these will dissociate, but I don't think that adds any more complexity because they're already in their respective forms.

Wait, but what about the phosphate equilibria? Does the presence of both ions affect their concentrations via the Ka values?

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using the equilibrium expressions.

The reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is:

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

The equilibrium expression is Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

We can rearrange this to find [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-] ) / [H+].

But wait, we don't know [H+], but we can relate [H+] to the pH. Alternatively, from the buffer equation, we have pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Wait, but I think I have the concentrations of the two ions in solution, so I can plug them into the buffer equation to find the pH. Then, using that pH, I can find the actual concentration of HPO4^2-?

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach. Because if the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will remain approximately as added, assuming that the added amounts are in excess of any possible reaction. Or, more accurately, the solution will adjust the pH so that the ratio of the concentrations corresponds to the buffer equation.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the total concentration of phosphate species.

Wait, the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. So, the initial concentrations from the salts are 0.036725 M H2PO4^- and 0.028065 M HPO4^2-.

But wait, these are the concentrations in the solution, right? Because each salt dissociates completely. So, the HPO4^2- comes directly from Na2HPO4·2H2O, and H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4.

So, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is simply 0.028065 M, but I'm not sure because the solution might undergo some dissociation or reaction.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution's pH is determined by their ratio. But in this case, the initial concentrations are fixed by the amounts of the two salts. So the solution's pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which uses the ratio of the two concentrations.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. Wait, but is there any further dissociation? Or is it that the concentration is just what comes from the salt?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the salts dissociate completely, so the initial concentrations are established. But then, in solution, the H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, or accept a proton to become H3PO4. Similarly, HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

Wait, but because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the solution is a buffer. So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will remain in a certain ratio, determined by the buffer equation. So the actual concentrations in solution will be the same as the initial concentrations, adjusted by any reactions.

Wait, but no, buffer solutions don't change the concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base; they just resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. So in this case, the initial concentrations are set by the salts, and the pH is determined by their ratio.

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, are the concentrations of the ions simply as calculated from the moles divided by the volume? Because that's a straightforward approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering the buffer solution's pH and thereby adjusting the concentrations.

Wait, but the problem is simply asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. So perhaps the answer is just 0.028065 M, but wait, let me check the options.

Wait, the options are in the order of 1e-7 M, but 0.028 M is about 2.8e-2 M, which is way higher than any of the options. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Ah! Wait a second. The problem states that the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. But in solution, these dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-, and Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm calculating the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as 0.036725 M and 0.028065 M, respectively. But the options are much lower. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the salts. Let me check:

KH2PO4: formula is K(H2PO4). So when it dissociates, it gives K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So yes, the moles are correctly calculated. So the concentrations should be 0.036725 M and 0.028065 M. But the options given are in the 1e-7 M range. So that suggests that I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concentration of the phosphate species with the concentration of the ions in solution. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of phosphate in a specific form, like the free HPO4^2- ion, accounting for any dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the autoionization of water. But that's probably negligible at 25°C.

Wait, another possibility: when these salts are dissolved, they may form a buffer, and the pH of the solution will affect the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution's pH is determined by the ratio of the two concentrations. So perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is not just its initial concentration but adjusted by the pH.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me think again about the buffer solution.

H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- form a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which is pH = 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.036725) 

As I calculated earlier, that ratio is approximately 0.7645, so log is about -0.115. So pH is about 7.092.

Now, knowing the pH, can I find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, but the initial concentrations are 0.036725 M H2PO4^- and 0.028065 M HPO4^2-.

Wait, but if I'm considering the dissociation, perhaps the solution's pH is such that some of the H2PO4^- converts to HPO4^2- or vice versa. But that doesn't make sense because the buffer system resists such changes.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that it's in equilibrium with H2PO4^- based on the pH.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the pH based on the ratio of the concentrations. So perhaps the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are as calculated from the moles, and the pH is determined by that ratio, so the concentrations are fixed.

But then why are the options so low? Oh wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me recheck.

Wait, 1 gram of KH2PO4 is 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol. 1 gram of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

So, moles of H2PO4^-: 0.007346 mol in 0.2 L → 0.03673 M.

Moles of HPO4^2-: 0.005613 mol in 0.2 L → 0.028065 M.

So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, which is ~2.8e-2 M, not anywhere near the options given. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the initial concentrations but the actual concentration after considering the dissociation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a buffer but a solution where the phosphate exists in different forms, and the orthophosphate is the HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of the HPO4^2- ion in solution, considering that some of the H2PO4^- may convert to HPO4^2- based on the pH determined by the buffer.

But how? Let me think again. The buffer solution's pH is 7.092, as calculated earlier. At this pH, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 10^(pH - pKa2) → 10^(7.092 - 7.207) = 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.764.

Which matches the initial ratio of 0.028065 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7645.

So, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are as we calculated, and the solution's pH is determined by that ratio. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028065 M, which is 2.8e-2 M. But that doesn't match any of the options. So I must have a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer. Maybe the solution is such that the phosphate exists in a different form. Wait, because when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the solution's pH is such that the predominant species is HPO4^2-, but perhaps the phosphate is not all in that form.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem involves the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions in solution. Because even though the salts dissociate completely, the ions can undergo hydrolysis. For example, H2PO4^- can act as an acid or a base.

Wait, but in this case, since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the concentrations of the ions are as calculated, leading to a pH of around 7.09.

But again, this leads to a concentration of HPO4^2- of ~0.028 M, which is way higher than the options provided.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me double-check.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007346 mol.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol, so 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but wait: Na2HPO4·2H2O is the formula. The formula unit is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005613 mol, correct.

But in the solution, the HPO4^2- might undergo some dissociation. Wait, but in a buffer solution, the concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base are determined by the Henderson equation, so maybe the initial concentrations are what matter.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a buffer but about the solubility of the salts, but I don't think that's the case here because both are soluble in water.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which might be including the HPO4^2- and some other forms. But that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total phosphate concentration and then find the fraction that is HPO4^2-.

Wait, the total phosphate concentration would be the sum of all phosphate species: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

But in solution, considering the pH, most of the phosphate is in the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- forms.

But I'm not sure if this approach would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the buffer and is treating each salt separately, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is considering the solubility of the salts, but I don't think so because the problem gives the masses, implying complete dissolution.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is not acting as a buffer, but the phosphate ions are in equilibrium, and the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found using the second dissociation constant.

Wait, if I have H3PO4 in solution, it can donate two protons:

H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

But in this problem, we're adding a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so it's a buffer. So the concentrations of these species are determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- when the solution is a buffer, but using the given Ka values.

Wait, but the buffer equation gives the ratio of concentrations, but not the absolute concentrations. However, the total concentration of phosphate would be [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-].

So the total concentration is 0.03673 + 0.028065 = 0.064795 M.

But using the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] × 10^{pH - pKa2}.

We found pH = 7.092, pKa2 =7.207.

So, 10^{7.092-7.207} = 10^{-0.115} ≈ 0.764.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 × [H2PO4^-].

But if the total concentration is 0.064795 M, then:

[H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.064795 M.

Substituting [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 [H2PO4^-]:

[H2PO4^-] + 0.764 [H2PO4^-] = 0.064795 → 1.764 [H2PO4^-] = 0.064795 → [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.064795 / 1.764 ≈ 0.0367 M.

Which gives [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 × 0.0367 ≈ 0.0280 M.

Which brings us back to the same numbers as before. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.0280 M, which is 2.8e-2 M. But the options are way lower. So I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let's think again: the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no. Wait, orthophosphate is the form HPO4^2-, right? Wait, no. Orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, but when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^-, which is dihydrogen phosphate, and then HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is phosphate.

Wait, I'm getting confused about the terminology. Let me check: Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it dissociates, it forms H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-. So the term 'orthophosphate' can sometimes refer to the HPO4^2- ion. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the sum of all phosphate species, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the second dissociation step.

Wait, no, because the solution contains the HPO4^2- from the sodium salt, so it's already in that form.

But then why do the options have such low concentrations?

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the solution's pH, and using the Ka2 expression.

So, perhaps the approach is:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange this to find [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

But in the buffer solution, [H+] is determined by the pH, which we can find using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, from the Henderson equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We have the initial concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M

So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.03673) → 7.207 + log(0.7645) → 7.207 - 0.114 ≈ 7.093.

So [H+] = 10^{-pH} = 10^{-7.093} ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka2 expression:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 = 6.2e-8

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M

[H+] = 8.23e-8 M

So [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.03673) / (8.23e-8)

Calculating numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.03673 ≈ 2.28266e-9

Divide by 8.23e-8: 2.28266e-9 / 8.23e-8 ≈ 2.775e-2 M.

Which is about 0.02775 M, but that's still way higher than the options given. So I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Let me think about the charge balance. In the solution, the cations must balance the anions.

The cations are K+ from KH2PO4 and Na+ from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Moles of K+ = 0.007346 mol.

Moles of Na+ = 2 * 0.005613 = 0.011226 mol.

Total cations: 0.007346 + 0.011226 = 0.018572 mol.

Anions: H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

H2PO4^-: 0.007346 mol.

HPO4^2-: 0.005613 mol.

Total anion charge: (0.007346 * 1) + (0.005613 * 2) = 0.007346 + 0.011226 = 0.018572 mol.

So charge balance is satisfied. So that approach doesn't reveal any error.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028 M is correct, but the options are wrong. Wait, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3- or another form, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution after accounting for all possible equilibria, not just the buffer.

Wait, but in this case, the buffer solution's pH is around 7.09, which is close to pKa2 (7.207), so the ratio is close to 1 (since pH is just a bit lower than pKa). So I'd expect [HPO4^2-] to be slightly less than [H2PO4^-], which matches our initial ratio.

But then again, the concentration is around 0.028 M, which isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is not about mixing the two salts, but about each salt separately. Let me reread the problem statement.

The problem says the solution contains 1.00 g of each salt. So it's a mixture, not separate solutions.

Wait, but what if the solution's volume is 200 cm³, but the salts take up some volume, so the actual solution volume is more than 200 cm³? But the problem states the volume is 200.00 cm³, so I think we can ignore any volume change upon dissolving.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions, but that's not what the question says. The question says orthophosphate, which I'm pretty sure refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, but in solution, it can hydrolyze further. For example, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to form PO4^3-.

But the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the given Ka values and the concentrations of H+ and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is 7.09, and at this pH, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium, so I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the Ka2 expression.

But again, I'm stuck because the initial concentrations seem to already satisfy the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total concentration of phosphate, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 / 177.99 = approximately 0.005613 mol.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So the molar mass is (2*22.99) + (90.97 + 4*16.00) + (2*18.015) → 45.98 + 90.97 + 4*16 = 45.98 + 90.97 +64= 200.95? Wait, but the given molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate the molar mass.

Wait, Na is 22.99, H is 1.008, P is 30.97, O is 16.00.

So Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Na: 2 *22.99 =45.98

H: (1 in HPO4) + (2*2 in H2O) → 1 + 4 =5 → 5 *1.008=5.04.

P: 30.97.

O:4 + (2*1) from H2O → 4+2=6 →6 *16=96.

Total: 45.98 +5.04 +30.97 +96 = 177.99 g/mol. So that's correct.

So 1g is 0.005613 mol.

So, the only conclusion I can reach is that the problem's options don't align with the calculations, but perhaps I'm missing a crucial point.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the concentration in the solution after the phosphate species have undergone hydrolysis, but that's already accounted for in the buffer.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the concentrations are not in the correct ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a basic buffer, and the HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in the buffer equation, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-. So the equation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of the pH and then use it to find [HPO4^2-].

Given that [HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M and [H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.028065 / 0.036725) → pKa2 is 7.207.

log(0.028065/0.036725) = log(0.7645) ≈ -0.114.

So pH =7.207 -0.114 =7.093.

Now, perhaps the problem expects me to find [HPO4^2-] using the exact Ka2 expression.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-]

We know Ka2 is 6.2e-8, [H+] is 1e-7.093 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So rearranging:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) / 8.23e-8.

Calculate numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.036725 ≈ 2.282e-9.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 2.282e-9 /8.23e-8 ≈ 0.02775 M.

Which is 2.775e-2 M, which is 0.02775 M. But this is still way higher than the options given.

Wait, the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is 1e-7. That's ten million times smaller than what I have. So that's impossible. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the first dissociation, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion in a solution where it's the predominant species. Wait, but in this case, it's a buffer solution, so it's not the case.

Wait, wait a second. The problem says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". Orthophosphate is H3PO4. But wait, in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and exists in various forms. But in this case, we have added H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so H3PO4 would be minimal.

Wait, that can't be right. The problem states that the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, respectively. So the orthophosphate (H3PO4) would be negligible.

Wait, but then the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the concentration is simply the moles of HPO4^2- divided by the volume. So 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M, which is 2.8e-2 M. But that's not any of the options.

So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Ah! Wait a minute. The problem says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions", which is HPO4^2-, but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration from the dissociation of H3PO4, not from the salts.

But that can't be because the solution is made by adding the salts, which provide the ions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution isn't a buffer, and the phosphate exists in equilibrium. Let me consider that.

If I have pure H3PO4, it would dissociate into H2PO4^- and H+ based on Ka1. But in this case, the solution is made by adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so maybe the equilibrium is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the buffer effect, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

In that case, H2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+:

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

The initial concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03673 M. Let x be the concentration that dissociates.

So, at equilibrium:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 - x ≈ 0.03673 (since x is small compared to initial concentration).

[H+] = x.

[HPO4^2-] = x.

So, Ka2 = (x)(x) / (0.03673) → x^2 = 0.03673 * 6.2e-8 → x^2 = 2.282e-9 → x = sqrt(2.282e-9) ≈ 4.776e-5 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = 4.776e-5 M. But that's 4.776e-5 M, which is 4.776e-5 = 4.776 × 10^-5 M. That's still larger than the options, which are around 1e-7.

Hmm, but this approach assumes that the solution is not a buffer, which contradicts the initial condition of mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer because the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are not in a 1:1 ratio. But in this case, the ratio is 0.764, which is close but not exactly 1.

Wait, but if the problem is using this second approach where H2PO4^- dissociates to form HPO4^2-, then the concentration is about 4.776e-5 M, which is 4.8e-5 M, but that's still not matching any options.

Wait, the options are on the order of 1e-7 M, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 100 somewhere. Did I mix up grams and milligrams somewhere?

Wait, no. The problem states 1.00 g of each salt, and the molecular weights are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the first dissociation (Ka1) instead of Ka2. Let me try that.

If I mistakenly use Ka1 (7.5e-3) instead of Ka2:

Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

But in this case, we're dealing with H2PO4^- dissociating into H+ and HPO4^2-, so Ka2 is the correct one to use.

But perhaps the problem expects me to use the third dissociation, which might be even smaller.

Wait, but the third dissociation is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So [PO4^3-] would be negligible, about 1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+].

But again, this doesn't align with the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in pure water, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the concentration of HPO4^2- is the same as the concentration of H2PO4^-, but that doesn't make sense because their concentrations are different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the total concentration of phosphate species, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial moles.

Wait, 1.00 g of KH2PO4 is 1 / 136.09 = 0.007345 mol.

1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1 / 177.99 = 0.005613 mol.

So, in 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But in that case, H2PO4^- would contribute a small amount to HPO4^2-, which would add to the initial amount from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

But earlier calculation shows that H2PO4^- dissociates to give about 4.77e-5 M HPO4^2-.

So the total [HPO4^2-] would be 0.028065 + 4.77e-5 ≈ 0.028113 M. Still way higher than the options.

Wait, but that would require adding a small amount to the initial [HPO4^2-], which is not going to change the concentration significantly.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where it's the only phosphate species, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the concentration of a base in a buffer solution. Let me think: the concentration of the base is [base] = ([base]_initial) * (1 + [H+]/Ka).

Wait, no, that's not the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact expression.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

We have the initial concentrations [base] = 0.028065 M, [acid] = 0.036725 M.

We can compute pH as 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.036725) ≈7.207 -0.115=7.092.

Then, using the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = ( [H+][HPO4^2-] ) / [H2PO4^- ]

We can rearrange to [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-] ) / [H+ ]

We know Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M.

[H+] is 1e-7.092 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Plugging in:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) / 8.23e-8 → (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) = 2.282e-9.

2.282e-9 / 8.23e-8 = 0.02775 M.

Which is 2.775e-2 M, same as before. So I'm back to the same result.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-7 M. So perhaps the problem is not about mixing the two salts but about a single salt.

Wait, perhaps the question is about Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolving in water, and finding the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But the problem states that both salts are present, so that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where only KH2PO4 is present. Let me try that.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007345 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so [H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M.

H2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 = (x)(x) / (0.036725 - x) ≈ (x^2)/0.036725 → x^2 = 0.036725 * 6.2e-8 → x= sqrt(2.28e-9)= 4.776e-5 M.

So [HPO4^2-] is 4.776e-5 M, which is 4.776e-5 = 4.776 x10^-5 M.

But that's still higher than the options.

Wait, but the options are in the 1e-7 range. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the third dissociation, but that would give even smaller concentrations.

Wait, but the third dissociation is for HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But if [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M and [H+] is 8.23e-8, then:

PO4^3- = (1.8e-12 * 0.028) / 8.23e-8 → (5.04e-14)/8.23e-8 ≈ 6.12e-7 M.

Which is about 6.12e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But the question is about HPO4^2- concentration, not PO4^3-.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-.

So I'm really stuck here.

Another approach: perhaps I need to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that both salts contribute, and the solution's pH affects the ratio.

But I'm going in circles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a dilution problem. Let me see: when you mix the two solutions, the concentration changes. But no, the problem states that the volume is 200 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is made by mixing the two salts, and the total volume is 200 cm³. So perhaps the concentrations are as calculated, but the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in terms of the solution's pH.

But I keep getting 0.028 M, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a calculation error. Let me recheck the initial moles.

1.00 g KH2PO4 / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007345 mol.

1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005613 mol.

In 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where it's the only phosphate species. But in that case, it would be 0.028065 M, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is not a buffer, and the phosphate exists as HPO4^2- in equilibrium with H2PO4^- and H+.

Wait, but if it's not a buffer, then the concentrations are determined by the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the solution is prepared with these two salts, but it's not a buffer because the pH is determined by another factor, like the autoionization of water. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the concentration of HPO4^2- using the initial moles and the pH calculated earlier.

Wait, but I tried that and it didn't give me an option that matches.

Another Idea: Maybe the problem is considering the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in the solution after all possible equilibria, including the third dissociation, have been considered.

But I calculated that PO4^3- is about 6.12e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M). But the question is about HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the orthophosphate ion is actually H3PO4, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the phosphate species again. Orthophosphate (H3PO4) is the fully protonated form, and when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), then PO4^3- (phosphate).

So the term 'orthophosphate' refers to H3PO4, which is a weak acid. But in the solution, the predominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because of the buffer.

But since the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is H3PO4, that would be negligible in this solution, as the problem is adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the concentration of H3PO4 would be very low, but the problem is asking for HPO4^2-.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is in error, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the exact formula, considering both salts.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: Maybe I should consider the total concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- as a sum, and then find their ratio based on the pH.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula for a buffer solution, but I'm not getting the correct result.

Wait, perhaps the pH is 7.09, and at that pH, the fraction of phosphate in the HPO4^2- form can be found using the Henderson equation.

The fraction would be [HPO4^2-]/([HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-]).

So the fraction is 0.028065 / (0.028065 + 0.036725) ≈ 0.028065 / 0.06479 ≈ 0.432.

So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.432 * total phosphate concentration.

But total phosphate concentration is 0.064795 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.432 * 0.064795 ≈ 0.028065 M, which brings us back to the same number.

I'm really stuck here. The problem's options don't align with any of my calculations, so perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer. Maybe it's not a buffer because the two salts provide different species.

Wait, but the two salts do provide the acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), so it should form a buffer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about buffer calculations but about the solubility of the salts. But both salts are highly soluble in water, so that's not the case.

Another Idea: Perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the initial moles and the solution volume, but considering that some of the H2PO4^- converts to HPO4^2- based on the pH.

But that's what I did earlier, and it didn't change the concentration significantly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume) × (1 + [H+]/Ka2 )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration using the equation:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume) × (Ka2 / (Ka2 + [H+] )) )

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where the only source is the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

In that case, as calculated earlier, [HPO4^2-] would be approximately 4.77e-5 M, which is still higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration using the third dissociation.

But that would yield PO4^3- concentration, not HPO4^2-.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. All my approaches lead to a concentration higher than the options provided. Perhaps I should look at the options and see which one could make sense.

The options are:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B) 5.48e-7 M

C) 2.81e-7 M

D) 3.97e-7 M

Hmm, all are around 1e-7 M. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration based on the third dissociation.

Wait, let's try that. Using the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

But in this case, the concentration of PO4^3- would be (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M,

[H+] = 8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.23e-8 → (5.0517e-14) /8.23e-8 ≈6.136e-7 M.

Which is about 6.136e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But the question is about HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration of HPO4^2- to be the same as PO4^3-, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the second dissociation, but with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume) × (Ka2 / (Ka2 + [H+] )) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the concentration considering that the solution is not a buffer, and only the Na2HPO4·2H2O contributes to HPO4^2-.

But that's not the case, as the KH2PO4 also contributes to the phosphate species.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer and calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the Henderson equation.

But I'm back to the same result.

At this point, I think I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere, but I can't figure out where. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the calculations I've done.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the problem is not about a buffer solution and is instead about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution made by dissolving the two salts, considering that both contribute to the same ion.

But that doesn't make sense because one salt gives H2PO4^- and the other gives HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total concentration of phosphate and then find the fraction in HPO4^2- form.

The total concentration is 0.036725 + 0.028065 =0.06479 M.

The fraction of HPO4^2- is [HPO4^2-]/([HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-]) = 0.028065 / 0.06479 ≈ 0.432.

So, if I'm to find the concentration of HPO4^2- as a fraction of the total, it's 0.432 * 0.06479 ≈0.028065 M, which is the same as before.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and can't find a way to get the concentration down to 1e-7 M. Therefore, I must conclude that I'm missing something fundamental, but given the options, the closest I got was 6.1e-7 M when calculating PO4^3- concentration, which is option A. But since the question is about HPO4^2-, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3.97e-7 M.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is expecting me to find the concentration using the formula for a weak base.

Wait, given the time I've spent and the options, I'll have to pick an answer. Based on my earlier calculation where PO4^3- comes out to about 6.1e-7 M, which is close to option A, but the question is about HPO4^2-, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration using the second dissociation, which would be about 4.77e-5 M, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me check once more.

1.00 g KH2PO4 → 1 / 136.09 = 0.007345 mol.

1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O → 1 /177.99 = 0.005613 mol.

In 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

So, the only conclusion I can reach is that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended approach is to use the Henderson equation and find the pH, then use the Ka2 expression to find [HPO4^2-], which gives 2.77e-2 M, which isn't an option.

But since the options are all much lower, perhaps the intended approach is different. Maybe the problem is considering that the solution is a buffer and the concentration of HPO4^2- is calculated using the ratio from the buffer equation, but adjusted by the solution's volume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- as the same as the concentration from the Na2HPO4·2H2O salt, which is 0.028065 M, but that's not an option either.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the problem is in error, and the correct answer isn't listed. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume) × (Ka2) / (Ka2 + [H+])

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles × Ka2) / (volume × (Ka2 + [H+]))

But I'm not familiar with such a formula.

Given the time I've spent and the options available, I'll have to make an educated guess. The only option that's close to any of my calculations is option A (6.24e-7 M), which I got from the PO4^3- concentration, but that's not what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3.97e-7 M.

But I'm not confident. Given that, I'll have to choose the option that matches the calculation I did for PO4^3- concentration, which is close to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in a solution containing 1.00 g each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, dissolved in 200.00 cm³ of water. The solution is a buffer system due to the presence of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O). The relevant equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸ for the reaction:

\[
\text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{HPO₄²⁻}
\]

### Key Calculations:
1. **Moles of Salts**:
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \)
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \)

2. **Concentrations in Solution**:
   - \([ \text{H₂PO₄⁻} ] = \frac{0.007345}{0.2} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}\)
   - \([ \text{HPO₄²⁻} ] = \frac{0.005613}{0.2} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M}\)

3. **Buffer System**:
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{pKa₂} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
   \]
   Substituting \(\text{pKa₂} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\) and the ratio \(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028065}{0.036725} \approx 0.7645\):
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.7645) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
   \]

4. **Revisiting [HPO₄²⁻]**:
   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₂:
   \[
   K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}
   \]
   Rearranging for \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}]\):
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
   \]
   Substituting \(K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), \([\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = 0.036725 \, \text{M}\), and \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\):
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{(6.2 \times 10^{-8})(0.036725)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 0.02775 \, \text{M}
   \]
   This result is much higher than the options provided, suggesting a misalignment between the calculated value and the expected answer.

5. **Considering PO₄³⁻**:
   The concentration of PO₄³⁻, formed via the third dissociation:
   \[
   \text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \, K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
   \]
   Using:
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
   \]
   Substituting \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = 0.028065 \, \text{M}\) and \([\text{H⁺}] = 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\):
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028065)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.12 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]
   This matches closely with option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

### Conclusion:
The problem likely intends for the concentration of orthophosphate ions to refer to PO₄³⁻, not HPO₄²⁻. Based on the calculations, the closest match to the provided options is:

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. Oh right, it's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution made by mixing two phosphoric acid salts. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion, right?

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 gram each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are provided as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

Wait, I think I need to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in this solution. But wait, when you mix these two salts, what happens? Both are related to the phosphate ion, so maybe they form a buffer solution. Let me think. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), so when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So when they're both in solution, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions are present. 

Wait, but in water, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The H3PO4 can lose protons stepwise:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, in solution, the phosphate species will depend on the pH. Since we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, which provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively, this mixture should form a buffer. Buffer solutions are made from a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. 

In this case, H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (but wait, is H2PO4^- an acid or a base? Since it can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, it's acting as an acid. Alternatively, it can accept a proton to become H3PO4, so it's a base as well. So in this case, the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. 

So the solution is a buffer solution consisting of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. To find the concentration of HPO4^2-, we need to determine the pH of the solution first, because the concentration of HPO4^2- depends on the pH. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2- because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to form HPO4^2-. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is approximately 7.207, right? Let me calculate that: log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → 0.7924 -8 → -7.2076? Wait, wait. No, wait: 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8, so the pKa is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that: log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 0.792 makes the log(6.2e-8) = 0.792 -8 = -7.208. So pKa is 7.208.

Wait, no. Wait, pKa = -log(Ka). So for Ka2 = 6.2e-8, pKa2 is 7.207, because 10^(-7.207) ≈ 6.2e-8.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But wait, how do I find the pH here? Alternatively, maybe I can find the concentrations of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, then use the equation to find the ratio, and then find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution's pH is determined by the buffer. So we need to find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-] based on their concentrations in the solution.

Wait, another approach: when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base (or vice versa), the ratio of the concentrations determines the pH. So in this case, the buffer consists of H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). So the initial moles of each can be calculated, and then their ratio can be used in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So first, calculate the moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass (g) / molecular weight (g/mol) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but for each mole of KH2PO4, how much H2PO4^- is produced? Each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, the solution has 0.007345 mol H2PO4^- and 0.005613 mol HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. The volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 L. So to get concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M.

Wait, but so the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.028065 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7645.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log ( [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] )

So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.7645).

What's log(0.7645)? Well, log(0.7) is about -0.155, log(0.75)= approx -0.1249, log(0.7645)= let me compute it more accurately.

Using calculator: 0.7645.

Hmm, log(0.7645) ≈ log(7.645e-1) = log(7.645) + log(1e-1) → log(7.645)=0.884 (since 10^0.884≈7.645), so 0.884 -1 = -0.116. Alternatively, I can remember that log(0.76)= about -0.117, so 0.7645 is a bit higher, say log(0.7645)= -0.115.

So pH = 7.207 + (-0.115) = 7.092.

Wait, but wait—this pH is around 7.09. Now, how does this help me find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Because the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the ratio of their concentrations is determined by the pH. But I think I already used that to find the pH. Hmm, perhaps I'm going in circles here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the moles and then relate that to the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait, the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but in solution, the concentration of HPO4^2- would depend on the pH. Because HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

But in the buffer solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are fixed by the amounts of the two salts we added, right? Because the buffer resists pH change when small amounts of acid or base are added, but in this case, the initial concentrations are from the salts.

Wait, but wait, perhaps that's not the case. Because the buffer solution's pH is determined by the ratio of the two salts. So when you have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the pH is determined by that ratio.

But in reality, the pH of the solution will adjust based on that ratio, and in that solution, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be in a ratio determined by the buffer equation.

Wait a minute, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. So the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- come from the two salts. The total volume is 0.2 L. So their concentrations are 0.036725 M and 0.028065 M, respectively.

But when dissolved in water, these will dissociate, but I don't think that adds any more complexity because they're already in their respective forms.

Wait, but what about the phosphate equilibria? Does the presence of both ions affect their concentrations via the Ka values?

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using the equilibrium expressions.

The reaction between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- is:

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

The equilibrium expression is Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

We can rearrange this to find [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-] ) / [H+].

But wait, we don't know [H+], but we can relate [H+] to the pH. Alternatively, from the buffer equation, we have pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Wait, but I think I have the concentrations of the two ions in solution, so I can plug them into the buffer equation to find the pH. Then, using that pH, I can find the actual concentration of HPO4^2-?

Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach. Because if the solution is a buffer, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will remain approximately as added, assuming that the added amounts are in excess of any possible reaction. Or, more accurately, the solution will adjust the pH so that the ratio of the concentrations corresponds to the buffer equation.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the total concentration of phosphate species.

Wait, the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. So, the initial concentrations from the salts are 0.036725 M H2PO4^- and 0.028065 M HPO4^2-.

But wait, these are the concentrations in the solution, right? Because each salt dissociates completely. So, the HPO4^2- comes directly from Na2HPO4·2H2O, and H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4.

So, perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is simply 0.028065 M, but I'm not sure because the solution might undergo some dissociation or reaction.

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution's pH is determined by their ratio. But in this case, the initial concentrations are fixed by the amounts of the two salts. So the solution's pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which uses the ratio of the two concentrations.

Wait, but the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. Wait, but is there any further dissociation? Or is it that the concentration is just what comes from the salt?

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the salts dissociate completely, so the initial concentrations are established. But then, in solution, the H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, or accept a proton to become H3PO4. Similarly, HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3- or accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

Wait, but because both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, the solution is a buffer. So the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will remain in a certain ratio, determined by the buffer equation. So the actual concentrations in solution will be the same as the initial concentrations, adjusted by any reactions.

Wait, but no, buffer solutions don't change the concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base; they just resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added. So in this case, the initial concentrations are set by the salts, and the pH is determined by their ratio.

Wait, but for the purpose of this problem, are the concentrations of the ions simply as calculated from the moles divided by the volume? Because that's a straightforward approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires considering the buffer solution's pH and thereby adjusting the concentrations.

Wait, but the problem is simply asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- ions. So perhaps the answer is just 0.028065 M, but wait, let me check the options.

Wait, the options are in the order of 1e-7 M, but 0.028 M is about 2.8e-2 M, which is way higher than any of the options. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Ah! Wait a second. The problem states that the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. But in solution, these dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-, and Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but I'm calculating the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as 0.036725 M and 0.028065 M, respectively. But the options are much lower. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the salts. Let me check:

KH2PO4: formula is K(H2PO4). So when it dissociates, it gives K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when it dissociates, it gives 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So yes, the moles are correctly calculated. So the concentrations should be 0.036725 M and 0.028065 M. But the options given are in the 1e-7 M range. So that suggests that I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concentration of the phosphate species with the concentration of the ions in solution. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of phosphate in a specific form, like the free HPO4^2- ion, accounting for any dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the autoionization of water. But that's probably negligible at 25°C.

Wait, another possibility: when these salts are dissolved, they may form a buffer, and the pH of the solution will affect the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution's pH is determined by the ratio of the two concentrations. So perhaps the concentration of HPO4^2- is not just its initial concentration but adjusted by the pH.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me think again about the buffer solution.

H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- form a buffer. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which is pH = 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.036725) 

As I calculated earlier, that ratio is approximately 0.7645, so log is about -0.115. So pH is about 7.092.

Now, knowing the pH, can I find the concentration of HPO4^2-?

Wait, but the initial concentrations are 0.036725 M H2PO4^- and 0.028065 M HPO4^2-.

Wait, but if I'm considering the dissociation, perhaps the solution's pH is such that some of the H2PO4^- converts to HPO4^2- or vice versa. But that doesn't make sense because the buffer system resists such changes.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that it's in equilibrium with H2PO4^- based on the pH.

Wait, but the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives the pH based on the ratio of the concentrations. So perhaps the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are as calculated from the moles, and the pH is determined by that ratio, so the concentrations are fixed.

But then why are the options so low? Oh wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me recheck.

Wait, 1 gram of KH2PO4 is 1 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007346 mol. 1 gram of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

So, moles of H2PO4^-: 0.007346 mol in 0.2 L → 0.03673 M.

Moles of HPO4^2-: 0.005613 mol in 0.2 L → 0.028065 M.

So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028065 M, which is ~2.8e-2 M, not anywhere near the options given. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the initial concentrations but the actual concentration after considering the dissociation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a buffer but a solution where the phosphate exists in different forms, and the orthophosphate is the HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of the HPO4^2- ion in solution, considering that some of the H2PO4^- may convert to HPO4^2- based on the pH determined by the buffer.

But how? Let me think again. The buffer solution's pH is 7.092, as calculated earlier. At this pH, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 10^(pH - pKa2) → 10^(7.092 - 7.207) = 10^(-0.115) ≈ 0.764.

Which matches the initial ratio of 0.028065 / 0.036725 ≈ 0.7645.

So, the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are as we calculated, and the solution's pH is determined by that ratio. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028065 M, which is 2.8e-2 M. But that doesn't match any of the options. So I must have a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer. Maybe the solution is such that the phosphate exists in a different form. Wait, because when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, the solution's pH is such that the predominant species is HPO4^2-, but perhaps the phosphate is not all in that form.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem involves the hydrolysis of the phosphate ions in solution. Because even though the salts dissociate completely, the ions can undergo hydrolysis. For example, H2PO4^- can act as an acid or a base.

Wait, but in this case, since both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the concentrations of the ions are as calculated, leading to a pH of around 7.09.

But again, this leads to a concentration of HPO4^2- of ~0.028 M, which is way higher than the options provided.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me double-check.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007346 mol.

Molar mass of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 177.99 g/mol, so 1.00 g / 177.99 ≈ 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but wait: Na2HPO4·2H2O is the formula. The formula unit is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the moles of HPO4^2- are 0.005613 mol, correct.

But in the solution, the HPO4^2- might undergo some dissociation. Wait, but in a buffer solution, the concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base are determined by the Henderson equation, so maybe the initial concentrations are what matter.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a buffer but about the solubility of the salts, but I don't think that's the case here because both are soluble in water.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which might be including the HPO4^2- and some other forms. But that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total phosphate concentration and then find the fraction that is HPO4^2-.

Wait, the total phosphate concentration would be the sum of all phosphate species: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

But in solution, considering the pH, most of the phosphate is in the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- forms.

But I'm not sure if this approach would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the buffer and is treating each salt separately, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution is considering the solubility of the salts, but I don't think so because the problem gives the masses, implying complete dissolution.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is not acting as a buffer, but the phosphate ions are in equilibrium, and the concentration of HPO4^2- can be found using the second dissociation constant.

Wait, if I have H3PO4 in solution, it can donate two protons:

H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

But in this problem, we're adding a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so it's a buffer. So the concentrations of these species are determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- when the solution is a buffer, but using the given Ka values.

Wait, but the buffer equation gives the ratio of concentrations, but not the absolute concentrations. However, the total concentration of phosphate would be [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-].

So the total concentration is 0.03673 + 0.028065 = 0.064795 M.

But using the buffer equation, [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-] × 10^{pH - pKa2}.

We found pH = 7.092, pKa2 =7.207.

So, 10^{7.092-7.207} = 10^{-0.115} ≈ 0.764.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 × [H2PO4^-].

But if the total concentration is 0.064795 M, then:

[H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.064795 M.

Substituting [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 [H2PO4^-]:

[H2PO4^-] + 0.764 [H2PO4^-] = 0.064795 → 1.764 [H2PO4^-] = 0.064795 → [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.064795 / 1.764 ≈ 0.0367 M.

Which gives [HPO4^2-] = 0.764 × 0.0367 ≈ 0.0280 M.

Which brings us back to the same numbers as before. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.0280 M, which is 2.8e-2 M. But the options are way lower. So I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let's think again: the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but wait, no. Wait, orthophosphate is the form HPO4^2-, right? Wait, no. Orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, but when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^-, which is dihydrogen phosphate, and then HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is phosphate.

Wait, I'm getting confused about the terminology. Let me check: Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. When it dissociates, it forms H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2-, then PO4^3-. So the term 'orthophosphate' can sometimes refer to the HPO4^2- ion. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the sum of all phosphate species, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the second dissociation step.

Wait, no, because the solution contains the HPO4^2- from the sodium salt, so it's already in that form.

But then why do the options have such low concentrations?

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration of HPO4^2- considering the solution's pH, and using the Ka2 expression.

So, perhaps the approach is:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-]

We can rearrange this to find [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

But in the buffer solution, [H+] is determined by the pH, which we can find using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So, from the Henderson equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

We have the initial concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M

So, pH = 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.03673) → 7.207 + log(0.7645) → 7.207 - 0.114 ≈ 7.093.

So [H+] = 10^{-pH} = 10^{-7.093} ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka2 expression:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 = 6.2e-8

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 M

[H+] = 8.23e-8 M

So [HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.03673) / (8.23e-8)

Calculating numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.03673 ≈ 2.28266e-9

Divide by 8.23e-8: 2.28266e-9 / 8.23e-8 ≈ 2.775e-2 M.

Which is about 0.02775 M, but that's still way higher than the options given. So I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Let me think about the charge balance. In the solution, the cations must balance the anions.

The cations are K+ from KH2PO4 and Na+ from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Moles of K+ = 0.007346 mol.

Moles of Na+ = 2 * 0.005613 = 0.011226 mol.

Total cations: 0.007346 + 0.011226 = 0.018572 mol.

Anions: H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

H2PO4^-: 0.007346 mol.

HPO4^2-: 0.005613 mol.

Total anion charge: (0.007346 * 1) + (0.005613 * 2) = 0.007346 + 0.011226 = 0.018572 mol.

So charge balance is satisfied. So that approach doesn't reveal any error.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.028 M is correct, but the options are wrong. Wait, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3- or another form, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution after accounting for all possible equilibria, not just the buffer.

Wait, but in this case, the buffer solution's pH is around 7.09, which is close to pKa2 (7.207), so the ratio is close to 1 (since pH is just a bit lower than pKa). So I'd expect [HPO4^2-] to be slightly less than [H2PO4^-], which matches our initial ratio.

But then again, the concentration is around 0.028 M, which isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is not about mixing the two salts, but about each salt separately. Let me reread the problem statement.

The problem says the solution contains 1.00 g of each salt. So it's a mixture, not separate solutions.

Wait, but what if the solution's volume is 200 cm³, but the salts take up some volume, so the actual solution volume is more than 200 cm³? But the problem states the volume is 200.00 cm³, so I think we can ignore any volume change upon dissolving.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions, but that's not what the question says. The question says orthophosphate, which I'm pretty sure refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the HPO4^2- comes from the Na2HPO4·2H2O, but in solution, it can hydrolyze further. For example, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to form PO4^3-.

But the Ka3 is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2, so the concentration of PO4^3- would be negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the given Ka values and the concentrations of H+ and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is 7.09, and at this pH, the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are in equilibrium, so I can find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the Ka2 expression.

But again, I'm stuck because the initial concentrations seem to already satisfy the buffer equation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total concentration of phosphate, but that doesn't fit the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1.00 / 177.99 = approximately 0.005613 mol.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So the molar mass is (2*22.99) + (90.97 + 4*16.00) + (2*18.015) → 45.98 + 90.97 + 4*16 = 45.98 + 90.97 +64= 200.95? Wait, but the given molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate the molar mass.

Wait, Na is 22.99, H is 1.008, P is 30.97, O is 16.00.

So Na2HPO4·2H2O:

Na: 2 *22.99 =45.98

H: (1 in HPO4) + (2*2 in H2O) → 1 + 4 =5 → 5 *1.008=5.04.

P: 30.97.

O:4 + (2*1) from H2O → 4+2=6 →6 *16=96.

Total: 45.98 +5.04 +30.97 +96 = 177.99 g/mol. So that's correct.

So 1g is 0.005613 mol.

So, the only conclusion I can reach is that the problem's options don't align with the calculations, but perhaps I'm missing a crucial point.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the concentration in the solution after the phosphate species have undergone hydrolysis, but that's already accounted for in the buffer.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not a buffer because the concentrations are not in the correct ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a basic buffer, and the HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but in the buffer equation, the base is HPO4^2-, and the acid is H2PO4^-. So the equation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of the pH and then use it to find [HPO4^2-].

Given that [HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M and [H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.028065 / 0.036725) → pKa2 is 7.207.

log(0.028065/0.036725) = log(0.7645) ≈ -0.114.

So pH =7.207 -0.114 =7.093.

Now, perhaps the problem expects me to find [HPO4^2-] using the exact Ka2 expression.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-]

We know Ka2 is 6.2e-8, [H+] is 1e-7.093 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

So rearranging:

[HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) / 8.23e-8.

Calculate numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.036725 ≈ 2.282e-9.

Divide by 8.23e-8: 2.282e-9 /8.23e-8 ≈ 0.02775 M.

Which is 2.775e-2 M, which is 0.02775 M. But this is still way higher than the options given.

Wait, the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is 1e-7. That's ten million times smaller than what I have. So that's impossible. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the first dissociation, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the concentration of the orthophosphate ion in a solution where it's the predominant species. Wait, but in this case, it's a buffer solution, so it's not the case.

Wait, wait a second. The problem says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions". Orthophosphate is H3PO4. But wait, in solution, H3PO4 is a weak acid and exists in various forms. But in this case, we have added H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so H3PO4 would be minimal.

Wait, that can't be right. The problem states that the solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O, which provide H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, respectively. So the orthophosphate (H3PO4) would be negligible.

Wait, but then the problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which would be HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the concentration is simply the moles of HPO4^2- divided by the volume. So 0.005613 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028065 M, which is 2.8e-2 M. But that's not any of the options.

So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Ah! Wait a minute. The problem says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions", which is HPO4^2-, but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration from the dissociation of H3PO4, not from the salts.

But that can't be because the solution is made by adding the salts, which provide the ions.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution isn't a buffer, and the phosphate exists in equilibrium. Let me consider that.

If I have pure H3PO4, it would dissociate into H2PO4^- and H+ based on Ka1. But in this case, the solution is made by adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so maybe the equilibrium is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the buffer effect, and the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

In that case, H2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+:

H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

The initial concentration of H2PO4^- is 0.03673 M. Let x be the concentration that dissociates.

So, at equilibrium:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03673 - x ≈ 0.03673 (since x is small compared to initial concentration).

[H+] = x.

[HPO4^2-] = x.

So, Ka2 = (x)(x) / (0.03673) → x^2 = 0.03673 * 6.2e-8 → x^2 = 2.282e-9 → x = sqrt(2.282e-9) ≈ 4.776e-5 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = 4.776e-5 M. But that's 4.776e-5 M, which is 4.776e-5 = 4.776 × 10^-5 M. That's still larger than the options, which are around 1e-7.

Hmm, but this approach assumes that the solution is not a buffer, which contradicts the initial condition of mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a buffer because the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are not in a 1:1 ratio. But in this case, the ratio is 0.764, which is close but not exactly 1.

Wait, but if the problem is using this second approach where H2PO4^- dissociates to form HPO4^2-, then the concentration is about 4.776e-5 M, which is 4.8e-5 M, but that's still not matching any options.

Wait, the options are on the order of 1e-7 M, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 100 somewhere. Did I mix up grams and milligrams somewhere?

Wait, no. The problem states 1.00 g of each salt, and the molecular weights are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the first dissociation (Ka1) instead of Ka2. Let me try that.

If I mistakenly use Ka1 (7.5e-3) instead of Ka2:

Ka1 = [H+][H2PO4^-] / [H3PO4]

But in this case, we're dealing with H2PO4^- dissociating into H+ and HPO4^2-, so Ka2 is the correct one to use.

But perhaps the problem expects me to use the third dissociation, which might be even smaller.

Wait, but the third dissociation is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So [PO4^3-] would be negligible, about 1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]/[H+].

But again, this doesn't align with the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in pure water, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the concentration of HPO4^2- is the same as the concentration of H2PO4^-, but that doesn't make sense because their concentrations are different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the total concentration of phosphate species, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the initial moles.

Wait, 1.00 g of KH2PO4 is 1 / 136.09 = 0.007345 mol.

1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O is 1 / 177.99 = 0.005613 mol.

So, in 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that some of it comes from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But in that case, H2PO4^- would contribute a small amount to HPO4^2-, which would add to the initial amount from Na2HPO4·2H2O.

But earlier calculation shows that H2PO4^- dissociates to give about 4.77e-5 M HPO4^2-.

So the total [HPO4^2-] would be 0.028065 + 4.77e-5 ≈ 0.028113 M. Still way higher than the options.

Wait, but that would require adding a small amount to the initial [HPO4^2-], which is not going to change the concentration significantly.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where it's the only phosphate species, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the concentration of a base in a buffer solution. Let me think: the concentration of the base is [base] = ([base]_initial) * (1 + [H+]/Ka).

Wait, no, that's not the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exact expression.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

We have the initial concentrations [base] = 0.028065 M, [acid] = 0.036725 M.

We can compute pH as 7.207 + log(0.028065 / 0.036725) ≈7.207 -0.115=7.092.

Then, using the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = ( [H+][HPO4^2-] ) / [H2PO4^- ]

We can rearrange to [HPO4^2-] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-] ) / [H+ ]

We know Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

[H2PO4^-] is 0.036725 M.

[H+] is 1e-7.092 ≈ 8.23e-8 M.

Plugging in:

[HPO4^2-] = (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) / 8.23e-8 → (6.2e-8 * 0.036725) = 2.282e-9.

2.282e-9 / 8.23e-8 = 0.02775 M.

Which is 2.775e-2 M, same as before. So I'm back to the same result.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e-7 M. So perhaps the problem is not about mixing the two salts but about a single salt.

Wait, perhaps the question is about Na2HPO4·2H2O dissolving in water, and finding the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But the problem states that both salts are present, so that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where only KH2PO4 is present. Let me try that.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007345 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L, so [H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M.

H2PO4^- can dissociate into HPO4^2- and H+.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 = (x)(x) / (0.036725 - x) ≈ (x^2)/0.036725 → x^2 = 0.036725 * 6.2e-8 → x= sqrt(2.28e-9)= 4.776e-5 M.

So [HPO4^2-] is 4.776e-5 M, which is 4.776e-5 = 4.776 x10^-5 M.

But that's still higher than the options.

Wait, but the options are in the 1e-7 range. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the third dissociation, but that would give even smaller concentrations.

Wait, but the third dissociation is for HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3=1.8e-12.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- would be (1.8e-12 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But if [HPO4^2-] is 0.028 M and [H+] is 8.23e-8, then:

PO4^3- = (1.8e-12 * 0.028) / 8.23e-8 → (5.04e-14)/8.23e-8 ≈ 6.12e-7 M.

Which is about 6.12e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But the question is about HPO4^2- concentration, not PO4^3-.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-.

So I'm really stuck here.

Another approach: perhaps I need to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that both salts contribute, and the solution's pH affects the ratio.

But I'm going in circles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a dilution problem. Let me see: when you mix the two solutions, the concentration changes. But no, the problem states that the volume is 200 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is made by mixing the two salts, and the total volume is 200 cm³. So perhaps the concentrations are as calculated, but the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in terms of the solution's pH.

But I keep getting 0.028 M, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a calculation error. Let me recheck the initial moles.

1.00 g KH2PO4 / 136.09 g/mol = 0.007345 mol.

1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O / 177.99 g/mol = 0.005613 mol.

In 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 / 0.2 = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.028065 M.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where it's the only phosphate species. But in that case, it would be 0.028065 M, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution is not a buffer, and the phosphate exists as HPO4^2- in equilibrium with H2PO4^- and H+.

Wait, but if it's not a buffer, then the concentrations are determined by the dissociation.

Wait, perhaps the solution is prepared with these two salts, but it's not a buffer because the pH is determined by another factor, like the autoionization of water. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the concentration of HPO4^2- using the initial moles and the pH calculated earlier.

Wait, but I tried that and it didn't give me an option that matches.

Another Idea: Maybe the problem is considering the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in the solution after all possible equilibria, including the third dissociation, have been considered.

But I calculated that PO4^3- is about 6.12e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M). But the question is about HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick, and the orthophosphate ion is actually H3PO4, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the phosphate species again. Orthophosphate (H3PO4) is the fully protonated form, and when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), then PO4^3- (phosphate).

So the term 'orthophosphate' refers to H3PO4, which is a weak acid. But in the solution, the predominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because of the buffer.

But since the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is H3PO4, that would be negligible in this solution, as the problem is adding H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So the concentration of H3PO4 would be very low, but the problem is asking for HPO4^2-.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is in error, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the exact formula, considering both salts.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: Maybe I should consider the total concentration of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- as a sum, and then find their ratio based on the pH.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula for a buffer solution, but I'm not getting the correct result.

Wait, perhaps the pH is 7.09, and at that pH, the fraction of phosphate in the HPO4^2- form can be found using the Henderson equation.

The fraction would be [HPO4^2-]/([HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-]).

So the fraction is 0.028065 / (0.028065 + 0.036725) ≈ 0.028065 / 0.06479 ≈ 0.432.

So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.432 * total phosphate concentration.

But total phosphate concentration is 0.064795 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.432 * 0.064795 ≈ 0.028065 M, which brings us back to the same number.

I'm really stuck here. The problem's options don't align with any of my calculations, so perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the solution is a buffer. Maybe it's not a buffer because the two salts provide different species.

Wait, but the two salts do provide the acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), so it should form a buffer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about buffer calculations but about the solubility of the salts. But both salts are highly soluble in water, so that's not the case.

Another Idea: Perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the initial moles and the solution volume, but considering that some of the H2PO4^- converts to HPO4^2- based on the pH.

But that's what I did earlier, and it didn't change the concentration significantly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume) × (1 + [H+]/Ka2 )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration using the equation:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume) × (Ka2 / (Ka2 + [H+] )) )

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where the only source is the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

In that case, as calculated earlier, [HPO4^2-] would be approximately 4.77e-5 M, which is still higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration using the third dissociation.

But that would yield PO4^3- concentration, not HPO4^2-.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. All my approaches lead to a concentration higher than the options provided. Perhaps I should look at the options and see which one could make sense.

The options are:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B) 5.48e-7 M

C) 2.81e-7 M

D) 3.97e-7 M

Hmm, all are around 1e-7 M. So perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the concentration based on the third dissociation.

Wait, let's try that. Using the third dissociation:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

But in this case, the concentration of PO4^3- would be (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M,

[H+] = 8.23e-8.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.23e-8 → (5.0517e-14) /8.23e-8 ≈6.136e-7 M.

Which is about 6.136e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7 M).

But the question is about HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration of HPO4^2- to be the same as PO4^3-, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the second dissociation, but with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume) × (Ka2 / (Ka2 + [H+] )) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the concentration considering that the solution is not a buffer, and only the Na2HPO4·2H2O contributes to HPO4^2-.

But that's not the case, as the KH2PO4 also contributes to the phosphate species.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer and calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- using the Henderson equation.

But I'm back to the same result.

At this point, I think I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere, but I can't figure out where. Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the calculations I've done.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the problem is not about a buffer solution and is instead about the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution made by dissolving the two salts, considering that both contribute to the same ion.

But that doesn't make sense because one salt gives H2PO4^- and the other gives HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total concentration of phosphate and then find the fraction in HPO4^2- form.

The total concentration is 0.036725 + 0.028065 =0.06479 M.

The fraction of HPO4^2- is [HPO4^2-]/([HPO4^2-] + [H2PO4^-]) = 0.028065 / 0.06479 ≈ 0.432.

So, if I'm to find the concentration of HPO4^2- as a fraction of the total, it's 0.432 * 0.06479 ≈0.028065 M, which is the same as before.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and can't find a way to get the concentration down to 1e-7 M. Therefore, I must conclude that I'm missing something fundamental, but given the options, the closest I got was 6.1e-7 M when calculating PO4^3- concentration, which is option A. But since the question is about HPO4^2-, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3.97e-7 M.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is expecting me to find the concentration using the formula for a weak base.

Wait, given the time I've spent and the options, I'll have to pick an answer. Based on my earlier calculation where PO4^3- comes out to about 6.1e-7 M, which is close to option A, but the question is about HPO4^2-, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the concentration using the second dissociation, which would be about 4.77e-5 M, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation. Let me check once more.

1.00 g KH2PO4 → 1 / 136.09 = 0.007345 mol.

1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O → 1 /177.99 = 0.005613 mol.

In 0.2 L:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.028065 M.

So, the only conclusion I can reach is that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended approach is to use the Henderson equation and find the pH, then use the Ka2 expression to find [HPO4^2-], which gives 2.77e-2 M, which isn't an option.

But since the options are all much lower, perhaps the intended approach is different. Maybe the problem is considering that the solution is a buffer and the concentration of HPO4^2- is calculated using the ratio from the buffer equation, but adjusted by the solution's volume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- as the same as the concentration from the Na2HPO4·2H2O salt, which is 0.028065 M, but that's not an option either.

Wait, another Idea: Perhaps the problem is in error, and the correct answer isn't listed. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the concentration of HPO4^2- using the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles of HPO4^2- ) / (volume) × (Ka2) / (Ka2 + [H+])

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula:

[HPO4^2-] = (moles × Ka2) / (volume × (Ka2 + [H+]))

But I'm not familiar with such a formula.

Given the time I've spent and the options available, I'll have to make an educated guess. The only option that's close to any of my calculations is option A (6.24e-7 M), which I got from the PO4^3- concentration, but that's not what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: 3.97e-7 M.

But I'm not confident. Given that, I'll have to choose the option that matches the calculation I did for PO4^3- concentration, which is close to option A.


The problem involves determining the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in a solution containing 1.00 g each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, dissolved in 200.00 cm³ of water. The solution is a buffer system due to the presence of H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O). The relevant equilibrium constant is Ka₂ = 6.2 × 10⁻⁸ for the reaction:

\[
\text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{HPO₄²⁻}
\]

### Key Calculations:
1. **Moles of Salts**:
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007345 \, \text{mol} \)
   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005613 \, \text{mol} \)

2. **Concentrations in Solution**:
   - \([ \text{H₂PO₄⁻} ] = \frac{0.007345}{0.2} \approx 0.036725 \, \text{M}\)
   - \([ \text{HPO₄²⁻} ] = \frac{0.005613}{0.2} \approx 0.028065 \, \text{M}\)

3. **Buffer System**:
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{pKa₂} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right)
   \]
   Substituting \(\text{pKa₂} = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207\) and the ratio \(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} = \frac{0.028065}{0.036725} \approx 0.7645\):
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.207 + \log(0.7645) \approx 7.207 - 0.115 = 7.092
   \]

4. **Revisiting [HPO₄²⁻]**:
   Using the equilibrium expression for Ka₂:
   \[
   K_a = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}
   \]
   Rearranging for \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}]\):
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{K_a \cdot [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
   \]
   Substituting \(K_a = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}\), \([\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = 0.036725 \, \text{M}\), and \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.092} \approx 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\):
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{(6.2 \times 10^{-8})(0.036725)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 0.02775 \, \text{M}
   \]
   This result is much higher than the options provided, suggesting a misalignment between the calculated value and the expected answer.

5. **Considering PO₄³⁻**:
   The concentration of PO₄³⁻, formed via the third dissociation:
   \[
   \text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \, K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
   \]
   Using:
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
   \]
   Substituting \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = 0.028065 \, \text{M}\) and \([\text{H⁺}] = 8.23 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\):
   \[
   [\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12})(0.028065)}{8.23 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.12 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
   \]
   This matches closely with option A (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

### Conclusion:
The problem likely intends for the concentration of orthophosphate ions to refer to PO₄³⁻, not HPO₄²⁻. Based on the calculations, the closest match to the provided options is:

**Answer: A**
