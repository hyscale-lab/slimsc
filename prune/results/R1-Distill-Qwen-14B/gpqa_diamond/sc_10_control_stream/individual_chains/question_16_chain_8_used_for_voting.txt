Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which happens when there's a chiral center in the molecule. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So I need to check each compound given and see if they have any chiral centers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? Or wait, but wait, the formula is but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 but with a Cl on carbon 1. Oh, wait, no: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon of but-1-ene, which is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, butene is CH2-CH2 on positions 1 and 2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl. But 2-methyl would make the structure CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, that's but-1-ene, so it's four carbons. So maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, and 2-methyl would change that. Wait no, but 2-methylbut-1-ene would be (CH2CH2CH(CH3))CH2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, and a methyl group on C2. So like Cl-C(C H3)=CH2-CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3? No, but then 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, so Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH=CHCH3? But wait, but that's but-1-ene as CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is ClCH2-CH=CHCH3. But wait, wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So perhaps it's CH2Cl attached to a double bond. So structure might be ClCH2-C(=CH2)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is part of a double bond. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, and 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, but 2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with a methyl on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be pentene, no. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Anyway, the key point is whether this compound has a chiral center. If the molecule has a double bond, it's in the (Z) configuration, but does that create a chiral center? Wait, double bonds can have E/Z isomerism, but a double bond itself doesn't create a chiral center. So for a compound to have optical activity, it needs a chiral center, which requires four different substituents. So for each compound, I need to look for such centers.

So first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Is there a chiral center here? Let's see: The molecule has a double bond, so the carbons involved in the double bond can't be chiral centers because they have double bonds (they have only three substituents, so can't be chiral). The other carbons: the first carbon is Cl, maybe, and perhaps the adjacent carbons. Wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, for but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding 1-chloro would make it CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3, but wait that's butane, not butene. Wait, no. Wait, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's not a double bond. Wait, but the compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be:

Cl
|
C1=C2 - CH(CH3) - CH2CH3?

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1: Cl, maybe another substituent. Let me think again. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the formula is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's without the double bond. Oh wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have the Cl on C1, making it CH2Cl-CH=CHCH3. But wait, that's 1-chlorobut-1-ene, but where's the methyl? Oh, the methyl is on C2. So structure is CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not a double bond. This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should move on and come back. Alternatively, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers because the double bond is in a position that doesn't create any with four different groups. So maybe no optical activity here.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, that's a complex name. Let me try to visualize. Isobenzofuran is a bicyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to a furan. Methano would mean a bridge between two atoms. In hexahydro, the furan part is hydrogenated. So the molecule is a bicyclic structure with a bridge. There's a chloromethylene group attached at position 8. Chloromethylene is CH2Cl. So the substituent is CH2Cl attached as a bridge? But how about the stereochemistry? The substituents would be in specific positions. If the substituent is attached to a bridgehead, would that lead to chirality? Bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral centers, but it depends on the structure. In this case, since the substituent is a methylene (CH2Cl), and the bridge has certain stereochemistry, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center. The (3aR,7aS,E) notation indicates specific configurations, so perhaps this molecule has multiple stereogenic centers. So yes, this compound is likely to have optical activity.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH. If both the 2 and 3 positions have methyl groups, then the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, looking at the two central carbons (C2 and C3). Each has a methyl group, and the other substituents are COOH groups, CH2 groups, etc. Wait, for C2: substituents are CH3, COOH, CH(CH3), and the other COOH? Wait, no, maybe not. Let's see: The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for C2: The substituents are:
- CH3 (methyl)
- COOH (from the carboxyl group at C1)
- CH(CH3) (the next carbon)
- The other group attached to C2 is the COOH from the other end? No, wait, no. Let me think. The structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH is succinic acid. When both CH2 groups are replaced by CH(CH3), it's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups, a COOH group, and a CH2 group (but wait, no, if they're CH(CH3), then each has:

For C2: substituents are:
- CH3 (from the methyl)
- two CH2- groups (Wait no, because the structure is C1: COOH, C2: CH(CH3), C3: CH(CH3), C4: COOH.

So for C2, the groups are:
- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (the same as C3)
- CH(CH3) (on the same carbon? No, each carbon is connected to four groups.

Wait, wait, let me correct. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) in succinic acid is CH2. When they are dimethyl, they become CH(CH3). So for C2, the groups would be:

- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, no, each carbon is connected to four substituents. So C2 is connected to:

- C1: which is a COOH group (since it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-...)

- C3: which is a CH(CH3)

- Two methyl groups (CH(CH3) means one methyl, but wait, no. Wait, 2,3-dimethyl means each of C2 and C3 have a methyl group. So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3).

So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1)
- two CH2 groups (Wait, no, C2 is attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? Or perhaps:

Wait, maybe the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for C2, the substituents are:

- COOH (C1)
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- Two CH3 groups? No, because each CH(CH3) is a single substituent â€” each carbon has four bonds. So:

Wait, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH2 in succinic acid. After substitution, they become CH(CH3).

So for C2:

- The groups attached are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), and two CH3 groups? Or wait, no, CH(CH3) is one substituent (a carbon with a methyl), but I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, in the structure HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, each of C2 and C3 has:

- One COOH group (C2 connected to C1, which is COOH; C3 connected to C4, which is COOH)
Wait no, C2 is connected to C1 and C3. So for C2:

Groups are:
- C1: HOOC-
- C3: CH(CH3)-
- Two methyl groups attached to C2? No, because the formula is CH(CH3). So each of C2 and C3 have a methyl group attached, but the other groups are the adjacent COOH and CH(CH3) groups. So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two H's? No, because CH(CH3) would have two Hs attached to C2. Wait, no, if C2 is CH(CH3), then it's connected to:

- C1 (COOH)
- C3 (CH(CH3))
- two CH3 groups? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each C2 and C3 is CH(CH3), meaning each has a methyl and three other substituents. Let me think of it as:

C2: connected to C1 (HOOC-), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So substituents are:

- HOOC- (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- two CH3 groups? No, that would make four substituents. Wait, if C2 is CH(CH3), then it's:

- C1: HOOC-
- C3: CH(CH3)
- two CH3 groups?

No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, a CH(CH3) group would have three substituents: the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3) and the methyl group. So:

For C2: groups are:

- C1 (HOOC-)
- C3 (CH(CH3))
- a methyl group (CH3)
- and perhaps another H?

Wait, but that would be four substituents: C1, C3, CH3, and H. So each of C2 and C3 has a H, a CH3, and two adjacent carbons. So on C2, substituents are:

- HOOC- (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- CH3 (methyl)
- H

Similarly for C3: substituents are:

- HOOC- (from C4)
- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- CH3
- H

Wait, but then for each of C2 and C3, the substituents are: two CH(CH3) groups (from the adjacent C), a methyl, and a hydrogen. So each of C2 and C3 would have four different groups?

Wait, no. The groups on C2 are:

- C1: HOOC-
- C3: CH(CH3)
- CH3
- H

So that's four different groups: HOOC-, CH(CH3), CH3, H. So C2 would be a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has:

- C4: HOOC-
- C2: CH(CH3)
- CH3
- H

Wait, but C3's substituents would be:

- C4: HOOC-
- C2: CH(CH3)
- CH3
- H

So same as C2? If that's the case, both C2 and C3 would be chiral centers. But wait, in the compound (2R,3S), the configuration is different for each. So each has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. So this compound has two chiral centers, meaning it's optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Same structure as the previous, but different configuration. So each of C2 and C3 are chiral centers, regardless of the configuration. So same as above, this compound is also optically active.

Wait, but wait, if both are R configurations, does that affect the optical activity? No, because having chiral centers makes the molecule chiral, so it will have optical activity regardless of the configuration. So both compounds 3 and 4 are chiral, so both are optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The structure is a cyclohexene ring with OH at C1. So the configuration is R, meaning it's a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center, so it's optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Let's see if any of these hydroxyl-bearing carbons are chiral. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

In a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two ring carbons and two substituents (the OH and two other groups, perhaps H). So for each OH-bearing carbon (1,3,5), what are the substituents?

Each OH is on a carbon connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two H's (since it's cyclohexane, each carbon is CH2, but when OH is attached, it becomes CH(OH)CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Cyclohexane is a six-membered ring of CH2 groups. If three of them (1,3,5) have OH groups, then each of those carbons has:

- Two adjacent ring CH2 groups (which are similar)
- An OH group
- A hydrogen.

So substituents for each OH-bearing carbon are:

- Two CH2 groups (same)
- OH
- H.

So that would make three substituents in total, but wait, each carbon is CH2, so when OH is attached, it's actually a CH(OH) group, connected to two other CH2 groups. So each of the OH-bearing carbons is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (which are similar)
- OH
- H.

But wait, for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four distinct substituents. Each OH-bearing carbon here has two identical substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups) and two others. So substituents are: two CH2 groups (same), OH, and H. That's equivalent to three substituents, but actually four, because each CH2 is attached to the next carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the structure is:

Each carbon with OH is attached to:

- Two adjacent carbons (each is CH2-OH for this one, but others are CH2)
Wait, no. Let's take carbon 1: it's connected to C6 and C2 (both CH2 groups), the OH group, and a hydrogen. So the substituents are:

- C6 (CH2-OH at C6? No, wait, C6 is part of the ring. So each ring carbon has two adjacent ring carbons, which are both CH2 groups (except the ones with OH). So for C1, substituents are:

- C6 (CH2)
- C2 (CH2)
- OH
- H.

So substituents are two CH2 groups (identical), OH, and H. So substituents are: two same (CH2), and two different (OH and H). But for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So in this case, two substituents are the same (the adjacent CH2 groups), so the carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, even though this molecule has three OH groups, none of the carbons are chiral centers because they each have two identical substituents (the adjacent ring CH2 groups). So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule has multiple stereocenters, but each is not chiral, it won't be optically active. So if all three OH-bearing carbons are not chiral centers, the compound is not chiral overall. So this compound does not have optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butanone, which has a methyl group on the third carbon. The structure is:

O
||
C1-(cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3(CH3) - C4.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO (but no, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2C(O)CH3? No, wait: butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. Wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO, which is butan-2-one. So butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2COCH3? Or maybe it's:

O
||
CH2-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but the key is whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center.

Looking at the structure, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1). So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact structure, but the key is to look for any chiral centers.

The carbonyl group is at C1. The cyclopentyl is attached to C1, so substituents on C1 are:

- O (double bonded)
- cyclopentyl
- two CH2 groups (if C1 is connected to CH2 and CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C (cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2.

So the carbonyl carbon (C1) is attached to:

- O (double bond)
- cyclopentyl
- CH2 (from C2)
- another CH2 (from C2?), but no, because butan-1-one has four carbons, with the ketone at the end. So maybe it's:

O
||
CH2-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3).

Wait, that's four carbons: O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl. No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl attached to C1 (carbonyl), then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2.

But regardless, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so not a chiral center. C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), C3 (CH(CH3)), two H's? So substituents are O=C-, CH(CH3), two H's. So four substituents: O=C-, CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe C2 is CH2, so substituents would be O=C-CH2- etc. Let's think about each carbon.

C1: carbonyl, not chiral.

C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), C3 (CH(CH3)), two H's. So substituents are O=C-, CH(CH3), and two H's. So it's not a chiral center because two substituents are H's (same).

C3: connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, H. So again, two substituents are CH2 groups (same), so not a chiral center.

C4: connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), C5 (maybe CH3?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH3. But regardless, unless a carbon has four different substituents, it's not chiral. So in this molecule, none of the carbons are chiral centers. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

So summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. So no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes, has chiral centers.

3. (2R,3S)-... : Yes, chiral centers.

4. (2R,3R)-... : Yes, chiral centers.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, chiral.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-... : No, because each OH-bearing carbon has two same substituents.

7. 1-cyclopentyl... : No, no chiral centers.

So how many have optical activity? Compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5. That's four.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Compound 2: If it's (3aR,7aS,E), the E indicates a double bond configuration. But the presence of R and S configurations suggests that the bridgehead carbons are chiral. So yes, this compound has optical activity.

Compound 3: (2R,3S) configuration, so two chiral centers, so optically active.

Compound 4: (2R,3R), also two chiral centers, so active.

Compound 5: (R) configuration, so a chiral center, so active.

That's four compounds (2,3,4,5) that are optically active. What about compound 6? Earlier I thought no. So that's four total.

Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me about optical activity. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which happens when there's a chiral center in the molecule. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. So I need to check each compound given and see if they have any chiral centers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? Or wait, but wait, the formula is but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 but with a Cl on carbon 1. Oh, wait, no: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon of but-1-ene, which is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, butene is CH2-CH2 on positions 1 and 2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is CH2Cl. But 2-methyl would make the structure CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, that's but-1-ene, so it's four carbons. So maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, and 2-methyl would change that. Wait no, but 2-methylbut-1-ene would be (CH2CH2CH(CH3))CH2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, and a methyl group on C2. So like Cl-C(C H3)=CH2-CH3? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3? No, but then 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, so Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH=CHCH3? But wait, but that's but-1-ene as CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is ClCH2-CH=CHCH3. But wait, wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So perhaps it's CH2Cl attached to a double bond. So structure might be ClCH2-C(=CH2)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is part of a double bond. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, and 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, but 2-methylbut-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with a methyl on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be pentene, no. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Anyway, the key point is whether this compound has a chiral center. If the molecule has a double bond, it's in the (Z) configuration, but does that create a chiral center? Wait, double bonds can have E/Z isomerism, but a double bond itself doesn't create a chiral center. So for a compound to have optical activity, it needs a chiral center, which requires four different substituents. So for each compound, I need to look for such centers.

So first compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Is there a chiral center here? Let's see: The molecule has a double bond, so the carbons involved in the double bond can't be chiral centers because they have double bonds (they have only three substituents, so can't be chiral). The other carbons: the first carbon is Cl, maybe, and perhaps the adjacent carbons. Wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So, for but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Adding 1-chloro would make it CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3, but wait that's butane, not butene. Wait, no. Wait, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene structure: the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, that can't be right because the double bond is between C1 and C2. So perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's not a double bond. Wait, but the compound is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be:

Cl
|
C1=C2 - CH(CH3) - CH2CH3?

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group). So C1: Cl, maybe another substituent. Let me think again. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the formula is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's without the double bond. Oh wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have the Cl on C1, making it CH2Cl-CH=CHCH3. But wait, that's 1-chlorobut-1-ene, but where's the methyl? Oh, the methyl is on C2. So structure is CH2Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3). Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not a double bond. This is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should move on and come back. Alternatively, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers because the double bond is in a position that doesn't create any with four different groups. So maybe no optical activity here.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Wow, that's a complex name. Let me try to visualize. Isobenzofuran is a bicyclic structure with a benzene ring fused to a furan. Methano would mean a bridge between two atoms. In hexahydro, the furan part is hydrogenated. So the molecule is a bicyclic structure with a bridge. There's a chloromethylene group attached at position 8. Chloromethylene is CH2Cl. So the substituent is CH2Cl attached as a bridge? But how about the stereochemistry? The substituents would be in specific positions. If the substituent is attached to a bridgehead, would that lead to chirality? Bridgehead carbons can sometimes be chiral centers, but it depends on the structure. In this case, since the substituent is a methylene (CH2Cl), and the bridge has certain stereochemistry, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center. The (3aR,7aS,E) notation indicates specific configurations, so perhaps this molecule has multiple stereogenic centers. So yes, this compound is likely to have optical activity.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH. If both the 2 and 3 positions have methyl groups, then the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, looking at the two central carbons (C2 and C3). Each has a methyl group, and the other substituents are COOH groups, CH2 groups, etc. Wait, for C2: substituents are CH3, COOH, CH(CH3), and the other COOH? Wait, no, maybe not. Let's see: The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for C2: The substituents are:
- CH3 (methyl)
- COOH (from the carboxyl group at C1)
- CH(CH3) (the next carbon)
- The other group attached to C2 is the COOH from the other end? No, wait, no. Let me think. The structure is:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH is succinic acid. When both CH2 groups are replaced by CH(CH3), it's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has two CH(CH3) groups, a COOH group, and a CH2 group (but wait, no, if they're CH(CH3), then each has:

For C2: substituents are:
- CH3 (from the methyl)
- two CH2- groups (Wait no, because the structure is C1: COOH, C2: CH(CH3), C3: CH(CH3), C4: COOH.

So for C2, the groups are:
- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (the same as C3)
- CH(CH3) (on the same carbon? No, each carbon is connected to four groups.

Wait, wait, let me correct. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) in succinic acid is CH2. When they are dimethyl, they become CH(CH3). So for C2, the groups would be:

- Two CH(CH3) groups? No, no, each carbon is connected to four substituents. So C2 is connected to:

- C1: which is a COOH group (since it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-...)

- C3: which is a CH(CH3)

- Two methyl groups (CH(CH3) means one methyl, but wait, no. Wait, 2,3-dimethyl means each of C2 and C3 have a methyl group. So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3).

So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1)
- two CH2 groups (Wait, no, C2 is attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? Or perhaps:

Wait, maybe the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for C2, the substituents are:

- COOH (C1)
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- Two CH3 groups? No, because each CH(CH3) is a single substituent â€” each carbon has four bonds. So:

Wait, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is CH2 in succinic acid. After substitution, they become CH(CH3).

So for C2:

- The groups attached are: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3) (C3), and two CH3 groups? Or wait, no, CH(CH3) is one substituent (a carbon with a methyl), but I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, in the structure HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, each of C2 and C3 has:

- One COOH group (C2 connected to C1, which is COOH; C3 connected to C4, which is COOH)
Wait no, C2 is connected to C1 and C3. So for C2:

Groups are:
- C1: HOOC-
- C3: CH(CH3)-
- Two methyl groups attached to C2? No, because the formula is CH(CH3). So each of C2 and C3 have a methyl group attached, but the other groups are the adjacent COOH and CH(CH3) groups. So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two H's? No, because CH(CH3) would have two Hs attached to C2. Wait, no, if C2 is CH(CH3), then it's connected to:

- C1 (COOH)
- C3 (CH(CH3))
- two CH3 groups? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps each C2 and C3 is CH(CH3), meaning each has a methyl and three other substituents. Let me think of it as:

C2: connected to C1 (HOOC-), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So substituents are:

- HOOC- (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- two CH3 groups? No, that would make four substituents. Wait, if C2 is CH(CH3), then it's:

- C1: HOOC-
- C3: CH(CH3)
- two CH3 groups?

No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, a CH(CH3) group would have three substituents: the two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3) and the methyl group. So:

For C2: groups are:

- C1 (HOOC-)
- C3 (CH(CH3))
- a methyl group (CH3)
- and perhaps another H?

Wait, but that would be four substituents: C1, C3, CH3, and H. So each of C2 and C3 has a H, a CH3, and two adjacent carbons. So on C2, substituents are:

- HOOC- (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- CH3 (methyl)
- H

Similarly for C3: substituents are:

- HOOC- (from C4)
- CH(CH3) (from C2)
- CH3
- H

Wait, but then for each of C2 and C3, the substituents are: two CH(CH3) groups (from the adjacent C), a methyl, and a hydrogen. So each of C2 and C3 would have four different groups?

Wait, no. The groups on C2 are:

- C1: HOOC-
- C3: CH(CH3)
- CH3
- H

So that's four different groups: HOOC-, CH(CH3), CH3, H. So C2 would be a chiral center. Similarly, C3 has:

- C4: HOOC-
- C2: CH(CH3)
- CH3
- H

Wait, but C3's substituents would be:

- C4: HOOC-
- C2: CH(CH3)
- CH3
- H

So same as C2? If that's the case, both C2 and C3 would be chiral centers. But wait, in the compound (2R,3S), the configuration is different for each. So each has four different substituents, making them chiral centers. So this compound has two chiral centers, meaning it's optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Same structure as the previous, but different configuration. So each of C2 and C3 are chiral centers, regardless of the configuration. So same as above, this compound is also optically active.

Wait, but wait, if both are R configurations, does that affect the optical activity? No, because having chiral centers makes the molecule chiral, so it will have optical activity regardless of the configuration. So both compounds 3 and 4 are chiral, so both are optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The structure is a cyclohexene ring with OH at C1. So the configuration is R, meaning it's a chiral center. So this compound has a chiral center, so it's optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Let's see if any of these hydroxyl-bearing carbons are chiral. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

In a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two ring carbons and two substituents (the OH and two other groups, perhaps H). So for each OH-bearing carbon (1,3,5), what are the substituents?

Each OH is on a carbon connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two H's (since it's cyclohexane, each carbon is CH2, but when OH is attached, it becomes CH(OH)CH2 groups? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Cyclohexane is a six-membered ring of CH2 groups. If three of them (1,3,5) have OH groups, then each of those carbons has:

- Two adjacent ring CH2 groups (which are similar)
- An OH group
- A hydrogen.

So substituents for each OH-bearing carbon are:

- Two CH2 groups (same)
- OH
- H.

So that would make three substituents in total, but wait, each carbon is CH2, so when OH is attached, it's actually a CH(OH) group, connected to two other CH2 groups. So each of the OH-bearing carbons is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (which are similar)
- OH
- H.

But wait, for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four distinct substituents. Each OH-bearing carbon here has two identical substituents (the adjacent CH2 groups) and two others. So substituents are: two CH2 groups (same), OH, and H. That's equivalent to three substituents, but actually four, because each CH2 is attached to the next carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the structure is:

Each carbon with OH is attached to:

- Two adjacent carbons (each is CH2-OH for this one, but others are CH2)
Wait, no. Let's take carbon 1: it's connected to C6 and C2 (both CH2 groups), the OH group, and a hydrogen. So the substituents are:

- C6 (CH2-OH at C6? No, wait, C6 is part of the ring. So each ring carbon has two adjacent ring carbons, which are both CH2 groups (except the ones with OH). So for C1, substituents are:

- C6 (CH2)
- C2 (CH2)
- OH
- H.

So substituents are two CH2 groups (identical), OH, and H. So substituents are: two same (CH2), and two different (OH and H). But for a chiral center, all four substituents must be different. So in this case, two substituents are the same (the adjacent CH2 groups), so the carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, even though this molecule has three OH groups, none of the carbons are chiral centers because they each have two identical substituents (the adjacent ring CH2 groups). So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule has multiple stereocenters, but each is not chiral, it won't be optically active. So if all three OH-bearing carbons are not chiral centers, the compound is not chiral overall. So this compound does not have optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butanone, which has a methyl group on the third carbon. The structure is:

O
||
C1-(cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3(CH3) - C4.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO (but no, butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait no, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2C(O)CH3? No, wait: butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. Wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO, which is butan-2-one. So butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2COCH3? Or maybe it's:

O
||
CH2-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but the key is whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center.

Looking at the structure, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So with a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1). So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-?

Wait, perhaps it's:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact structure, but the key is to look for any chiral centers.

The carbonyl group is at C1. The cyclopentyl is attached to C1, so substituents on C1 are:

- O (double bonded)
- cyclopentyl
- two CH2 groups (if C1 is connected to CH2 and CH(CH3)).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C (cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2.

So the carbonyl carbon (C1) is attached to:

- O (double bond)
- cyclopentyl
- CH2 (from C2)
- another CH2 (from C2?), but no, because butan-1-one has four carbons, with the ketone at the end. So maybe it's:

O
||
CH2-C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3).

Wait, that's four carbons: O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl. No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is cyclopentyl attached to C1 (carbonyl), then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2.

But regardless, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so not a chiral center. C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), C3 (CH(CH3)), two H's? So substituents are O=C-, CH(CH3), two H's. So four substituents: O=C-, CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe C2 is CH2, so substituents would be O=C-CH2- etc. Let's think about each carbon.

C1: carbonyl, not chiral.

C2: connected to C1 (O=C-), C3 (CH(CH3)), two H's. So substituents are O=C-, CH(CH3), and two H's. So it's not a chiral center because two substituents are H's (same).

C3: connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. So substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, H. So again, two substituents are CH2 groups (same), so not a chiral center.

C4: connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), C5 (maybe CH3?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH3. But regardless, unless a carbon has four different substituents, it's not chiral. So in this molecule, none of the carbons are chiral centers. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

So summarizing each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. So no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Yes, has chiral centers.

3. (2R,3S)-... : Yes, chiral centers.

4. (2R,3R)-... : Yes, chiral centers.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes, chiral.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-... : No, because each OH-bearing carbon has two same substituents.

7. 1-cyclopentyl... : No, no chiral centers.

So how many have optical activity? Compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5. That's four.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Compound 2: If it's (3aR,7aS,E), the E indicates a double bond configuration. But the presence of R and S configurations suggests that the bridgehead carbons are chiral. So yes, this compound has optical activity.

Compound 3: (2R,3S) configuration, so two chiral centers, so optically active.

Compound 4: (2R,3R), also two chiral centers, so active.

Compound 5: (R) configuration, so a chiral center, so active.

That's four compounds (2,3,4,5) that are optically active. What about compound 6? Earlier I thought no. So that's four total.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, which is necessary for a compound to exhibit optical activity.
