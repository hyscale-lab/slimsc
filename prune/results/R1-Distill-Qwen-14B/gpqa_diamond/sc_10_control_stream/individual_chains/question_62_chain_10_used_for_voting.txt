Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the structure should have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which probably means a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which in turn is attached to the cyclohexane ring. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group, which is a CHO group somewhere.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). Wait, no—hydroxy methyl would be -CH2OH. So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, and that's attached to the cyclohexane ring. Plus, the ring also has a carbaldehyde group, so a CHO somewhere.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group at position 1, and another is a CHO group. Or maybe it's a single substituent that includes the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxymethyl part. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try drawing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group that has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached. So, maybe it's like the methyl group is connected to both the cyclohexane ring and a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl group, but that's on the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde: that would be a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group attached. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, perhaps the structure is:

- The cyclohexane ring has a CHO group (carbaldehyde) at position 1.
- Also, at position 1, there's a substituent that is a CH2 group (methyl) which is attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, the nomenclature is a bit tricky. Let me think again.

The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, that's a methyl group (CH2-) that is substituted with a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon? Wait, that would make it a geminal diol, but with a cyclohexyl group. Wait, but that would imply the structure is CH2(OH)(Cyclohexyl). But that's not possible unless it's a quaternary carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, and that group is attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the substituent is -(CH2OH)-cyclohexyl. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent which is a cyclohexyl-CH2OH group attached to it, and also a CHO group on the same ring.

Wait, but the name is 1-(something)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde (CHO) group at position 1, and also another substituent at position 1 which is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, position 1 has two substituents: a CHO and a CH2OH-cyclohexyl.

Wait, that would make the structure a cyclohexane ring with two substituents on the same carbon: one is CHO and the other is CH2-OH. But also, the CH2-OH is attached to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a branching point. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is in turn attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1 which is CH2OH-cyclohexyl. Also, the main ring has a CHO group somewhere else. No, the name suggests that the substituent is at position 1, and the carbaldehyde is part of the main ring. So, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 1, and the ring itself has a carbaldehyde at position 1 as well. Wait, that would require two substituents on the same carbon, which is possible but a bit complex.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let's think about the reagents and the starting material. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (C≡C-) attached. Structure would be cyclohexane with a terminal alkyne group.

The target is a more complex molecule with both an aldehyde group and a cyclohexyl substituent with a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding groups to the ethynylcyclohexane.

So, ethynylcyclohexane can undergo various reactions. Let me think about the possible steps.

First, perhaps the alkyne could be functionalized. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. To make it into a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde), perhaps we can use some kind of oxidation or hydration. But wait, oxidation of an alkyne can give a diketone, but that's under strong oxidizing conditions. Alternatively, hydration of the alkyne could give a ketone if it's internal, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (CH2C≡C-?), no. Wait, ethynyl is C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So, structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

So, the starting material is cyclohexylacetylene.

So, possible reactions for a terminal alkyne: hydration, oxidation, or addition reactions. For example, using an alkyne, you can perform a hydration to form a ketone if it's internal, but in this case, the alkyne is terminal. Wait, no, wait, I think a terminal alkyne can be hydrated to form an aldehyde. Because a terminal alkyne is R-C≡CH, and upon hydration, it can form R-CH2-COH, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, when you hydrate a terminal alkyne, like HC≡C-R, under certain conditions you can get either a ketone or an aldehyde. Wait, I think the hydration can be directed by the catalyst. For example, with HgSO4 in H2SO4, a strong acid, the alkyne would be hydrated to form a ketone. Wait, but wait, that's for internal alkynes. For terminal alkynes, the hydration typically gives a ketone as well, but wait, that doesn't make sense because a terminal alkyne is R-C≡CH. Hydration would give R-CH2-COH? Or R-CH2-CHO?

Wait, no. Let me think. For a terminal alkyne, like CH3-C≡CH. When you add H2O in presence of HgSO4 and H2SO4, what happens? I think it would form an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is at the end, so adding water would give a carbonyl group. So, CH3-C≡CH → CH3-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, wait. When you add water to a terminal alkyne, the product is an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, so adding H2O would give R-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall: the hydration of a terminal alkyne typically leads to a ketone, but that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is at the end.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The hydration of an alkyne generally can be done under acidic or basic conditions. For a terminal alkyne, HgSO4 and H2SO4 (acidic) will give a ketone. Wait, no. Wait, I think the hydration of a terminal alkyne under these conditions gives a ketone, but that seems off because the triple bond is at the end. Maybe it's the other way around: internal alkynes give ketones, while terminal alkynes give aldehydes upon hydration.

Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think about the mechanism. When an alkyne is hydrated, it's a two-step addition of water to the triple bond. For a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH), adding water would add across the triple bond. In the presence of a catalyst like HgSO4 in H2SO4, the addition would proceed to form a ketone. But wait, that's not possible because the triple bond is at the end. So, perhaps the product is an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it forms a ketone, but that would require a more substituted site.

Wait, let me think about an example: ethyne (HC≡CH) when hydrated gives CH3CHO, acetaldehyde, which is an aldehyde. Oh, right! So, terminal alkynes upon hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 produce aldehydes. So, in the case of ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH), the hydration would add water to form cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO, a cyclohexylacetaldehyde.

Wait, so the first step would be to add a carbonyl group, specifically an aldehyde, to the ethynylcyclohexane.

But wait, looking at the target molecule, I don't see an aldehyde directly attached to the cyclohexane. Oh wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group (carbaldehyde). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group or something else.

Wait, the options are multiple steps. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Steps 1 to 4.

Option B: Steps 1 to 4.

Option C: Steps 1 to 4.

Option D: Steps 1 to 4.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis requires several steps, like deprotonation, then some kind of addition, oxidation, and so on.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think about possible reactions.

First, maybe the ethynyl group is functionalized. Let's think about each reagent.

Reagent NaNH2 and methyl chloride: NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Where would the proton be removed? The ethynyl group is sp-hybridized, so the terminal proton is acidic. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal alkyne, forming a cyclohexylacetylide.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide. So, cyclohexylacetylide + CH3Cl → cyclohexylpropargyl chloride? Or perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, methyl chloride is a methylating agent, so the acetylide would attack as a nucleophile. So, the acetylide (which is a strong base) would attack CH3Cl, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait. Or perhaps the alkylation would add a methyl group to the acetylide, extending the chain.

Wait, the acetylide is R-C≡C-^–. So, when it reacts with CH3Cl, it would form R-C≡C-CH2-Cl? Or perhaps R-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the acetylide (strong base) would deprotonate CH3Cl, but that's not likely. Alternatively, methyl chloride is a good methylating agent for acetylides. So, the acetylide (with negative charge at the sp carbon) would attack CH3Cl, leading to R-C≡C-CH3. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)prop-1-yn-1-ylmethyl group? Wait, no, perhaps it's (cyclohexyl)propane-1-yn-1-yl methyl.

Wait, perhaps it becomes R-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, because CH3Cl is methyl, so it's adding a methyl group to the acetylide. So, the initial structure is R-C≡CH. Deprotonated to R-C≡C^- Na+. Then, methyl chloride would provide a methyl group, so R-C≡C-CH3. So, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3, which is a propyne derivative.

Wait, but that might not directly help with the target structure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a longer chain or functionalized differently.

After that, looking at the options, some steps involve H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene.

But wait, the target molecule doesn't have a double bond; it's a cyclohexane ring with substituents. So, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated into a single bond, turning it into a single bond with adjacent substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which itself is attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, maybe through some kind of alkylation or substitution reaction, a cyclohexyl group is added.

Hmm, perhaps the process involves adding a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard or organometallic reagent. But looking at the reagents, I don't see Mg-based reagents in the options. Instead, NaNH2 and methyl chloride are present in some options.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is: deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylate it with a cyclohexyl group. But that's not directly in the options; maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced. For example, using H2 and Pd (hydrogenation) would turn the triple bond into a single bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH) becomes R-CH2-CH2 (but that's not possible because hydrogenation of triple bond would add two hydrogens, turning it into R-CH2-CH2-R? Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of R-C≡CH would give R-CH2-CH2- something? No, wait. Wait, the triple bond is between two carbons. So, R-C≡CH → R-CH2-CH2- when hydrogenated. No, wait, wait. No, hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and Pd would reduce it to a single bond (alkane). So, R-C≡CH becomes R-CH2-CH3. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexylpropane? Wait, no, cyclohexyl ethane? Hmm.

Wait, ethyne (HC≡CH) becomes ethane (CH3CH3) upon full hydrogenation. So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH) would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH3 upon hydrogenation, so 1-cyclohexylpropane or something.

But I'm not sure how that fits into the target molecule. Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, oxidation steps are taken to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the overall plan is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne to make it a longer chain.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.
3. Perform some oxidation or cleavage to form a carbonyl group.
4. Introduce a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a diol via some dihydroxylation or ozonolysis.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C, for example, has steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Hmm. So step 1 is deprotonate and alkylation. Step 2 is hydrogenation (probably of an alkyne to alkane). Step 3 is ozonolysis, which usually cleaves double bonds. Step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or saponification.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, so after step 1, we'd have a longer alkyne. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methylate it to add a methyl group. So, R-C≡CH → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Then, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, R-C≡C-Me → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis: but wait, if the molecule is now an alkane, ozonolysis won't do anything. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve converting the alkyne into a diene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne and perform a substitution to add a cyclohexyl group. But I'm not seeing that.

Wait, another angle: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps a cross coupling or some kind of ring expansion is involved.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then subjected to some kind of nucleophilic attack to add a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a protic solvent but also a methylating agent. Wait, but in what context? If you have an acetylide and you add methanol, perhaps it's a way to form an ether or a methyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by something else.

Wait, NaNH2 in methanol is a strong base. Maybe it's used for deprotonating the alkyne, making an acetylide, which could then react with something else. But what would methanol do here?

Alternatively, maybe NaNH2 and methanol is a method to form a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the first step is to perform a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. But I don't see a halide in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to form an alkyne with a new substituent. For example, NaNH2 and methyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to form an extended alkyne.

So, ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH) → R-C≡C^- Na^+ → R-C≡C-CH3 after reaction with CH3Cl. So, now it's R-C≡C-CH3.

Then, in the next step, perhaps hydrogenation (H2/Pd) would reduce the alkyne to an alkane: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But I'm not sure how that helps in building the target molecule.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexane ring with substituents, so perhaps another cyclohexyl group is introduced via some coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Let's think about that.

If we have R-C≡C-CH3, and we perform an oxidation to form a ketone. But wait, oxidation of a terminal alkyne (R-C≡C-R') typically forms a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to ozonolysis, which cleaves it into carbonyl groups. Ozonolysis of R-C≡C-CH3 would give two carbonyl compounds: R-C=O and CH3-C=O. But that would break the molecule into two parts, which doesn't seem helpful for the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps after some steps, we can form an enol ether or a diol.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is in turn attached to another cyclohexane ring, which also has a CHO group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bicyclic structure or a fused ring.

Wait, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a cyclohexane with a side chain that includes a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and then oxidized to form an aldehyde.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne functionalization to add a methyl group, then hydrogenate to a CH2 group.

2. Introduce a cyclohexyl group via some reaction, maybe using another cyclohexane ring as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, perhaps perform some kind of elimination to form a double bond, which could then be subjected to dihydroxylation or ozonolysis.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any dihydroxylation steps, only ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then further reactions.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis. But R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is an alkane, which doesn't have any double bonds, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Wait, no, H2/Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, not double. So, the product after step 2 would be R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I'm missing something.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by something else.

Wait, methanol is a poor methylating agent compared to methyl chloride. So, maybe NaNH2 and methanol is a way to form a Grignard or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction or something, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol group, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol (CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl). Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol and then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on the same substituent. That seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl, then a Grignard reagent is added to form a new carbon-carbon bond. But again, the reagents don't include Mg.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each reagent's role.

Looking at the options, all of them have NaNH2 and some alkylating agent as the first step. So, step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylation. So, the first step produces an extended alkyne.

For example, in option C, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which would add a methyl group to the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, hydrogenation of the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two H2 molecules.

Wait, but the target structure doesn't have a straight chain like that. Hmm.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but after hydrogenation, the molecule would have a single bond. So, perhaps I'm missing a step that introduces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, but that doesn't make sense because H2/Pd would reduce any triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, maybe there's a way to have a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a different structure that has a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: after adding a methyl group (step 1), perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think of each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form an extended alkyne.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2: strong base, maybe elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: hydration of a triple bond? But after step 2, it's a single bond.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule is something like R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 would cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond? But R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a straight chain; elimination would require a good leaving group, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide ring opening or for elimination in certain conditions. But I'm not sure.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: so, ethyl group is added to the alkyne.

2. Li/liq. NH3: this is a condition for Birch reduction, which typically reduces aromatic rings, but perhaps it's used for deprotonation or for elimination.

3. O3/H2O: ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH: workup, perhaps for reductive workup after ozonolysis.

Hmm, let's think. First, add ethyl group to alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe that's a deprotonation to form a strong base, or perhaps it's for an elimination reaction. Alternatively, it could be for a coupling reaction.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

But how does the molecule get a double bond after step 2?

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but where's the halide?

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: deprotonate alkyne, form acetylide. Then, perhaps methanol acts as an acid, but I'm not sure how. Maybe it's for quenching the acetylide, but that would just protonate it. Alternatively, perhaps it's for forming a methyl ether.

Wait, maybe the acetylide reacts with methanol to form an ether. So, R-C≡C-OCH3. But I'm not sure.

Then step 2: Li/liq. NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination reactions. So, R-C≡C-OCH3 might undergo elimination to form a triple bond again? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, we have an ether, and step 2 is for some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

Then, step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds.

Then, step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reductive workup.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target molecule.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: reduces alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: but the molecule is now an alkane, so ozonolysis won't do anything.

Hmm, doesn't make sense.

Option B:

After step 1, R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, but the molecule is an alkyne; not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's for deprotonation to form a strong base, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the target molecule's substituents. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl attached to the main cyclohexane, which also has a CHO group.

So, one approach is to add a cyclohexyl group to the main ring, then introduce a hydroxymethyl group, and then form the aldehyde.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbaldehyde group, then undergoes some alkylation to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, let's think about how to form the cyclohexyl group. Maybe via a Grignard reaction, but I don't see Mg-based reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is added via a substitution or alkylation.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to form propargylcyclohexane (R-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or R-C≡C-CH3? Not sure).

2. Then, hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Then, ozonolysis would need a double bond, but there isn't any, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, the molecule becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3, and then in the next step, Ba(OH)2 is used to form a diol via some oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol group, which can then be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde. But how to introduce the hydroxyl group.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again: It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is on the main cyclohexane ring. So, that's a secondary alcohol (since the OH is on a CH2 group attached to two cyclohexane rings). Also, the main ring has a CHO group.

Hmm, perhaps the main ring is formed via oxidation, and the substituent is added via some kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol substituent, which is then converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne (using NaNH2 and methyl chloride), making R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis would require a double bond, but without one, perhaps the molecule is broken down.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Functionalize the alkyne to add a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Then, perform some kind of elimination to form a double bond, perhaps using a strong base like NaNH2 again.

4. Ozonolysis would then cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, let's see which options have these steps.

Looking back, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, I think. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but with (CH3)2S, it's a reductive workup, which might form aldehydes or ketones from ozonides.

Wait, but after steps 1 and 2 in option C, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is an alkane. So, ozonolysis wouldn't act on that. So, perhaps option C isn't the right one.

Looking at option D, after step 1, perhaps the molecule is R-C≡C-OCH3 (if the acetylide reacted with methanol). Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which could deprotonate something or induce elimination. For instance, elimination could form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of the target molecule's functional groups and work backwards.

The target has:

- A cyclohexane ring (main ring) with a substituent at position 1.

- The substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group: so, a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

- The main ring also has a carbaldehyde (CHO) group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group (CHO) via hydration. But how?

2. Then, perform some kind of alkylation to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. To form a CHO group, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrated.

Wait, but earlier I thought that adding HgSO4 and H2SO4 to a terminal alkyne produces an aldehyde. So, step 1 could be that.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have HgSO4 and H2SO4 as the first step. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via some other method.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a two-step process. For example, first converting the alkyne into a carbonyl via hydrogenation and then oxidation.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the options again, all of them have NaNH2 and some alkylating agent as the first step. So, perhaps the first step is to form an extended alkyne.

After that, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, creating a longer chain.

Then, some kind of cleavage (like ozonolysis) is done to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. (H2/Pd) → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis would need a double bond, but this molecule doesn't have any. So, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond? No, H2/Pd would reduce triple bonds to single bonds, not create double bonds.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in step 3, ozonolysis is applied to a different part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule has a cyclohexene ring, then ozonolysis would cleave that. But the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane with a triple bond. So, I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the cyclohexane ring is opened or modified in some way to form a diene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

But I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps involve adding a cyclohexyl group through a substitution reaction.

Wait, in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, the acetylide is formed, then methanol might act as a methylating agent, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with a Grignard reagent, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps after adding a methyl group (step 1), the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, perhaps an elimination step forms a double bond elsewhere, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule has a substituent that is a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then reducing it to a secondary alcohol, and then oxidizing part of it to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule's substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, maybe the steps involve forming a cyclohexanol group, which is then attached to the main ring.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Let me go through option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: forms R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis. But after step 2, it's R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is an alkane. Ozonolysis won't react. So, this can't be right.

Hmm.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: form an acetylide, then perhaps react with methanol to form an ether, R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3: perhaps deprotonate something or induce elimination. Maybe eliminate to form a triple bond again?

3. O3/(CH3)2S: if there's a double bond now, would cleave it.

4. NH4OH: workup.

But I'm not sure how this forms the target molecule.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3: perhaps elimination to form a triple bond, or deprotonate something.

3. O3/H2O: cleaves double bonds.

4. NH4OH: workup.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2: Li in NH3. I'm not certain what that would do. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that's usually for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation to form a strong base, which could then eliminate to form a double bond. So, R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C≡C-CH2CH2^- Li^+ → upon elimination, could form R-C≡C-CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere. But I'm not sure.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing how this would lead to the target molecule.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the oxidation state changes.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which is a higher oxidation state than the starting alkyne. So, perhaps there's an oxidation step somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then into an aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

Another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexanol group, which is then oxidized to a ketone, and then further processed.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis: Wait, no double bond. So, perhaps this isn't the path.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but how to hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene? Because H2 with a catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis addition, but I don't see Lindlar's in the options. The options have H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne all the way to a single bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis: Not possible, as no double bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, despite the confusion.

Because step 3 in option C is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups, but if there's no alkene, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to form a cis-alkene. But with H2/Pd, it would go all the way to a single bond, not a cis-alkene.

Wait, unless the hydrogenation is partial. But I don't think Pd would stop at the alkene stage; it would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm.

Another approach: The target molecule has a secondary alcohol and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, and then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to a diketone, then subjected to some cleavage.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the options and the reaction steps, I think option C is the correct sequence because:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation reduces the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis is not applicable here, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a longer chain, and ozonolysis isn't the right step. I'm really not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

But without more clarity, I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH. So, perhaps the steps involve forming an epoxide, then opening it with a nucleophile like OH-.

But I don't see epoxidation reagents in the options.

Another idea: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to a nucleophilic addition to add the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

After all this, I think the correct sequence is option C.

The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group and a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely form an extended alkyne.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to a single bond.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O suggests hydration, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride add an ethyl group to the alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or induce elimination, but the role of this step is unclear.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O cleaves double bonds, but the molecule lacks a double bond after step 2.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride add a methyl group to the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S suggests ozonolysis, but the molecule is an alkane after step 2, so ozonolysis would not react.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, but its role is unclear in this context.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol likely form an acetylide, which may react with methanol to form an ether (R-C≡C-OCH₃).
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or induce elimination, but the exact transformation is unclear.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S suggests ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it involves steps that could potentially lead to the formation of the target molecule, despite some ambiguities in the later steps.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the structure should have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which probably means a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which in turn is attached to the cyclohexane ring. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group, which is a CHO group somewhere.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl). Wait, no—hydroxy methyl would be -CH2OH. So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, and that's attached to the cyclohexane ring. Plus, the ring also has a carbaldehyde group, so a CHO somewhere.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: one is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group at position 1, and another is a CHO group. Or maybe it's a single substituent that includes the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxymethyl part. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try drawing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent at position 1, which is a methyl group that has a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group attached. So, maybe it's like the methyl group is connected to both the cyclohexane ring and a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl group, but that's on the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde: that would be a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group attached. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So, perhaps the structure is:

- The cyclohexane ring has a CHO group (carbaldehyde) at position 1.
- Also, at position 1, there's a substituent that is a CH2 group (methyl) which is attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, the nomenclature is a bit tricky. Let me think again.

The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, that's a methyl group (CH2-) that is substituted with a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is CH2-OH and a cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon? Wait, that would make it a geminal diol, but with a cyclohexyl group. Wait, but that would imply the structure is CH2(OH)(Cyclohexyl). But that's not possible unless it's a quaternary carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, and that group is attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the substituent is -(CH2OH)-cyclohexyl. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent which is a cyclohexyl-CH2OH group attached to it, and also a CHO group on the same ring.

Wait, but the name is 1-(something)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde (CHO) group at position 1, and also another substituent at position 1 which is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So, position 1 has two substituents: a CHO and a CH2OH-cyclohexyl.

Wait, that would make the structure a cyclohexane ring with two substituents on the same carbon: one is CHO and the other is CH2-OH. But also, the CH2-OH is attached to a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a branching point. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is in turn attached to the cyclohexane ring. So, the main ring is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1 which is CH2OH-cyclohexyl. Also, the main ring has a CHO group somewhere else. No, the name suggests that the substituent is at position 1, and the carbaldehyde is part of the main ring. So, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl-CH2-OH group attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 1, and the ring itself has a carbaldehyde at position 1 as well. Wait, that would require two substituents on the same carbon, which is possible but a bit complex.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the structure. Let's think about the reagents and the starting material. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, that's cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (C≡C-) attached. Structure would be cyclohexane with a terminal alkyne group.

The target is a more complex molecule with both an aldehyde group and a cyclohexyl substituent with a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves adding groups to the ethynylcyclohexane.

So, ethynylcyclohexane can undergo various reactions. Let me think about the possible steps.

First, perhaps the alkyne could be functionalized. Ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. To make it into a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde), perhaps we can use some kind of oxidation or hydration. But wait, oxidation of an alkyne can give a diketone, but that's under strong oxidizing conditions. Alternatively, hydration of the alkyne could give a ketone if it's internal, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne (CH2C≡C-?), no. Wait, ethynyl is C≡CH. So, ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached. So, structure is cyclohexyl-C≡CH.

So, the starting material is cyclohexylacetylene.

So, possible reactions for a terminal alkyne: hydration, oxidation, or addition reactions. For example, using an alkyne, you can perform a hydration to form a ketone if it's internal, but in this case, the alkyne is terminal. Wait, no, wait, I think a terminal alkyne can be hydrated to form an aldehyde. Because a terminal alkyne is R-C≡CH, and upon hydration, it can form R-CH2-COH, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, no. Wait, when you hydrate a terminal alkyne, like HC≡C-R, under certain conditions you can get either a ketone or an aldehyde. Wait, I think the hydration can be directed by the catalyst. For example, with HgSO4 in H2SO4, a strong acid, the alkyne would be hydrated to form a ketone. Wait, but wait, that's for internal alkynes. For terminal alkynes, the hydration typically gives a ketone as well, but wait, that doesn't make sense because a terminal alkyne is R-C≡CH. Hydration would give R-CH2-COH? Or R-CH2-CHO?

Wait, no. Let me think. For a terminal alkyne, like CH3-C≡CH. When you add H2O in presence of HgSO4 and H2SO4, what happens? I think it would form an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is at the end, so adding water would give a carbonyl group. So, CH3-C≡CH → CH3-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, wait. When you add water to a terminal alkyne, the product is an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is R-C≡CH, so adding H2O would give R-CH2-CHO. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recall: the hydration of a terminal alkyne typically leads to a ketone, but that doesn't make sense because the triple bond is at the end.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The hydration of an alkyne generally can be done under acidic or basic conditions. For a terminal alkyne, HgSO4 and H2SO4 (acidic) will give a ketone. Wait, no. Wait, I think the hydration of a terminal alkyne under these conditions gives a ketone, but that seems off because the triple bond is at the end. Maybe it's the other way around: internal alkynes give ketones, while terminal alkynes give aldehydes upon hydration.

Wait, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think about the mechanism. When an alkyne is hydrated, it's a two-step addition of water to the triple bond. For a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH), adding water would add across the triple bond. In the presence of a catalyst like HgSO4 in H2SO4, the addition would proceed to form a ketone. But wait, that's not possible because the triple bond is at the end. So, perhaps the product is an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it forms a ketone, but that would require a more substituted site.

Wait, let me think about an example: ethyne (HC≡CH) when hydrated gives CH3CHO, acetaldehyde, which is an aldehyde. Oh, right! So, terminal alkynes upon hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 produce aldehydes. So, in the case of ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH), the hydration would add water to form cyclohexyl-CH2-CHO, a cyclohexylacetaldehyde.

Wait, so the first step would be to add a carbonyl group, specifically an aldehyde, to the ethynylcyclohexane.

But wait, looking at the target molecule, I don't see an aldehyde directly attached to the cyclohexane. Oh wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group (carbaldehyde). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group or something else.

Wait, the options are multiple steps. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Steps 1 to 4.

Option B: Steps 1 to 4.

Option C: Steps 1 to 4.

Option D: Steps 1 to 4.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis requires several steps, like deprotonation, then some kind of addition, oxidation, and so on.

Wait, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let me think about possible reactions.

First, maybe the ethynyl group is functionalized. Let's think about each reagent.

Reagent NaNH2 and methyl chloride: NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Where would the proton be removed? The ethynyl group is sp-hybridized, so the terminal proton is acidic. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate the terminal alkyne, forming a cyclohexylacetylide.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the acetylide. So, cyclohexylacetylide + CH3Cl → cyclohexylpropargyl chloride? Or perhaps it's a substitution. Wait, no, I'm not sure. Alternatively, methyl chloride is a methylating agent, so the acetylide would attack as a nucleophile. So, the acetylide (which is a strong base) would attack CH3Cl, giving cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡C-CH3? No, wait. Or perhaps the alkylation would add a methyl group to the acetylide, extending the chain.

Wait, the acetylide is R-C≡C-^–. So, when it reacts with CH3Cl, it would form R-C≡C-CH2-Cl? Or perhaps R-C≡C-CH3?

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the acetylide (strong base) would deprotonate CH3Cl, but that's not likely. Alternatively, methyl chloride is a good methylating agent for acetylides. So, the acetylide (with negative charge at the sp carbon) would attack CH3Cl, leading to R-C≡C-CH3. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)prop-1-yn-1-ylmethyl group? Wait, no, perhaps it's (cyclohexyl)propane-1-yn-1-yl methyl.

Wait, perhaps it becomes R-C≡C-CH2CH3? No, because CH3Cl is methyl, so it's adding a methyl group to the acetylide. So, the initial structure is R-C≡CH. Deprotonated to R-C≡C^- Na+. Then, methyl chloride would provide a methyl group, so R-C≡C-CH3. So, the alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3, which is a propyne derivative.

Wait, but that might not directly help with the target structure. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a longer chain or functionalized differently.

After that, looking at the options, some steps involve H2/Pd, which is hydrogenation. So, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene.

But wait, the target molecule doesn't have a double bond; it's a cyclohexane ring with substituents. So, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated into a single bond, turning it into a single bond with adjacent substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which itself is attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, maybe through some kind of alkylation or substitution reaction, a cyclohexyl group is added.

Hmm, perhaps the process involves adding a cyclohexyl group via a Grignard or organometallic reagent. But looking at the reagents, I don't see Mg-based reagents in the options. Instead, NaNH2 and methyl chloride are present in some options.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is: deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylate it with a cyclohexyl group. But that's not directly in the options; maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is reduced. For example, using H2 and Pd (hydrogenation) would turn the triple bond into a single bond. So, ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH) becomes R-CH2-CH2 (but that's not possible because hydrogenation of triple bond would add two hydrogens, turning it into R-CH2-CH2-R? Wait, no. Wait, hydrogenation of R-C≡CH would give R-CH2-CH2- something? No, wait. Wait, the triple bond is between two carbons. So, R-C≡CH → R-CH2-CH2- when hydrogenated. No, wait, wait. No, hydrogenation of a triple bond (alkyne) with H2 and Pd would reduce it to a single bond (alkane). So, R-C≡CH becomes R-CH2-CH3. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexylpropane? Wait, no, cyclohexyl ethane? Hmm.

Wait, ethyne (HC≡CH) becomes ethane (CH3CH3) upon full hydrogenation. So, ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH) would become cyclohexyl-CH2-CH3 upon hydrogenation, so 1-cyclohexylpropane or something.

But I'm not sure how that fits into the target molecule. Alternatively, perhaps after hydrogenation, oxidation steps are taken to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the overall plan is:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne to make it a longer chain.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond.
3. Perform some oxidation or cleavage to form a carbonyl group.
4. Introduce a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve forming a diol via some dihydroxylation or ozonolysis.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C, for example, has steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

Hmm. So step 1 is deprotonate and alkylation. Step 2 is hydrogenation (probably of an alkyne to alkane). Step 3 is ozonolysis, which usually cleaves double bonds. Step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, maybe for elimination or saponification.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, so after step 1, we'd have a longer alkyne. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methylate it to add a methyl group. So, R-C≡CH → R-C≡C-Me.

2. Then, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, R-C≡C-Me → R-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. Ozonolysis: but wait, if the molecule is now an alkane, ozonolysis won't do anything. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve converting the alkyne into a diene or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne and perform a substitution to add a cyclohexyl group. But I'm not seeing that.

Wait, another angle: The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps a cross coupling or some kind of ring expansion is involved.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via hydration, then subjected to some kind of nucleophilic attack to add a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a protic solvent but also a methylating agent. Wait, but in what context? If you have an acetylide and you add methanol, perhaps it's a way to form an ether or a methyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by something else.

Wait, NaNH2 in methanol is a strong base. Maybe it's used for deprotonating the alkyne, making an acetylide, which could then react with something else. But what would methanol do here?

Alternatively, maybe NaNH2 and methanol is a method to form a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the first step is to perform a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination. But I don't see a halide in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to form an alkyne with a new substituent. For example, NaNH2 and methyl chloride would deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methyl chloride to form an extended alkyne.

So, ethynylcyclohexane (R-C≡CH) → R-C≡C^- Na^+ → R-C≡C-CH3 after reaction with CH3Cl. So, now it's R-C≡C-CH3.

Then, in the next step, perhaps hydrogenation (H2/Pd) would reduce the alkyne to an alkane: R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But I'm not sure how that helps in building the target molecule.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexane ring with substituents, so perhaps another cyclohexyl group is introduced via some coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. Let's think about that.

If we have R-C≡C-CH3, and we perform an oxidation to form a ketone. But wait, oxidation of a terminal alkyne (R-C≡C-R') typically forms a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is subjected to ozonolysis, which cleaves it into carbonyl groups. Ozonolysis of R-C≡C-CH3 would give two carbonyl compounds: R-C=O and CH3-C=O. But that would break the molecule into two parts, which doesn't seem helpful for the target structure.

Alternatively, perhaps after some steps, we can form an enol ether or a diol.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is in turn attached to another cyclohexane ring, which also has a CHO group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bicyclic structure or a fused ring.

Wait, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is converted into a cyclohexane with a side chain that includes a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group, and then oxidized to form an aldehyde.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne functionalization to add a methyl group, then hydrogenate to a CH2 group.

2. Introduce a cyclohexyl group via some reaction, maybe using another cyclohexane ring as a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the first step is to add a methyl group to the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3. Then, hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, perhaps perform some kind of elimination to form a double bond, which could then be subjected to dihydroxylation or ozonolysis.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any dihydroxylation steps, only ozonolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, then further reactions.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: alkyne becomes R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: ozonolysis. But R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is an alkane, which doesn't have any double bonds, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Wait, no, H2/Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, not double. So, the product after step 2 would be R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe I'm missing something.

Looking at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: perhaps this is a deprotonation followed by something else.

Wait, methanol is a poor methylating agent compared to methyl chloride. So, maybe NaNH2 and methanol is a way to form a Grignard or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction or something, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol group, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl. But I'm not sure how that would fit.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is attached to the main cyclohexane ring. So, perhaps the substituent is a secondary alcohol (CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl). Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, which is then reduced to a secondary alcohol and then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxyl group on the same substituent. That seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl, then a Grignard reagent is added to form a new carbon-carbon bond. But again, the reagents don't include Mg.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each reagent's role.

Looking at the options, all of them have NaNH2 and some alkylating agent as the first step. So, step 1 is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylation. So, the first step produces an extended alkyne.

For example, in option C, step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride, which would add a methyl group to the alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH3.

Then, step 2 is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, hydrogenation of the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two H2 molecules.

Wait, but the target structure doesn't have a straight chain like that. Hmm.

Then, step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but after hydrogenation, the molecule would have a single bond. So, perhaps I'm missing a step that introduces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, but that doesn't make sense because H2/Pd would reduce any triple bonds to single bonds.

Wait, maybe there's a way to have a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a different structure that has a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: after adding a methyl group (step 1), perhaps the alkyne is converted into an enol ether or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think of each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form an extended alkyne.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2: strong base, maybe elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: hydration of a triple bond? But after step 2, it's a single bond.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule is something like R-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, Ba(OH)2 would cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond? But R-CH2-CH2-CH3 is a straight chain; elimination would require a good leaving group, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide ring opening or for elimination in certain conditions. But I'm not sure.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: so, ethyl group is added to the alkyne.

2. Li/liq. NH3: this is a condition for Birch reduction, which typically reduces aromatic rings, but perhaps it's used for deprotonation or for elimination.

3. O3/H2O: ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH: workup, perhaps for reductive workup after ozonolysis.

Hmm, let's think. First, add ethyl group to alkyne, making R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe that's a deprotonation to form a strong base, or perhaps it's for an elimination reaction. Alternatively, it could be for a coupling reaction.

Then, ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds, but if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyls.

But how does the molecule get a double bond after step 2?

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydrohalogenation, but where's the halide?

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: deprotonate alkyne, form acetylide. Then, perhaps methanol acts as an acid, but I'm not sure how. Maybe it's for quenching the acetylide, but that would just protonate it. Alternatively, perhaps it's for forming a methyl ether.

Wait, maybe the acetylide reacts with methanol to form an ether. So, R-C≡C-OCH3. But I'm not sure.

Then step 2: Li/liq. NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for elimination reactions. So, R-C≡C-OCH3 might undergo elimination to form a triple bond again? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, we have an ether, and step 2 is for some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

Then, step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave any double bonds.

Then, step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, perhaps for reductive workup.

But I'm not seeing how this leads to the target molecule.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: reduces alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: but the molecule is now an alkane, so ozonolysis won't do anything.

Hmm, doesn't make sense.

Option B:

After step 1, R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

Then, step 2: Li in NH3. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, but the molecule is an alkyne; not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's for deprotonation to form a strong base, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the target molecule's substituents. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl attached to the main cyclohexane, which also has a CHO group.

So, one approach is to add a cyclohexyl group to the main ring, then introduce a hydroxymethyl group, and then form the aldehyde.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbaldehyde group, then undergoes some alkylation to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, let's think about how to form the cyclohexyl group. Maybe via a Grignard reaction, but I don't see Mg-based reagents in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexyl group is added via a substitution or alkylation.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a bridge between two cyclohexane rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to form propargylcyclohexane (R-C≡C-CH2CH3? Or R-C≡C-CH3? Not sure).

2. Then, hydrogenated to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Then, ozonolysis would need a double bond, but there isn't any, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, the molecule becomes R-CH2-CH2-CH3, and then in the next step, Ba(OH)2 is used to form a diol via some oxidation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol group, which can then be oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde. But how to introduce the hydroxyl group.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again: It has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH, which is on the main cyclohexane ring. So, that's a secondary alcohol (since the OH is on a CH2 group attached to two cyclohexane rings). Also, the main ring has a CHO group.

Hmm, perhaps the main ring is formed via oxidation, and the substituent is added via some kind of alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexanol substituent, which is then converted into a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Add a methyl group to the alkyne (using NaNH2 and methyl chloride), making R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis would require a double bond, but without one, perhaps the molecule is broken down.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Functionalize the alkyne to add a methyl group, making R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Then, perform some kind of elimination to form a double bond, perhaps using a strong base like NaNH2 again.

4. Ozonolysis would then cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But wait, let's see which options have these steps.

Looking back, option C's step 3 is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. That's a reductive workup, I think. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups, but with (CH3)2S, it's a reductive workup, which might form aldehydes or ketones from ozonides.

Wait, but after steps 1 and 2 in option C, the molecule is R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is an alkane. So, ozonolysis wouldn't act on that. So, perhaps option C isn't the right one.

Looking at option D, after step 1, perhaps the molecule is R-C≡C-OCH3 (if the acetylide reacted with methanol). Then, step 2 is Li in NH3, which could deprotonate something or induce elimination. For instance, elimination could form a triple bond again, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of the target molecule's functional groups and work backwards.

The target has:

- A cyclohexane ring (main ring) with a substituent at position 1.

- The substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group: so, a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

- The main ring also has a carbaldehyde (CHO) group.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the ethynyl group into a carbonyl group (CHO) via hydration. But how?

2. Then, perform some kind of alkylation to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. To form a CHO group, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrated.

Wait, but earlier I thought that adding HgSO4 and H2SO4 to a terminal alkyne produces an aldehyde. So, step 1 could be that.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have HgSO4 and H2SO4 as the first step. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone via some other method.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into an aldehyde via a two-step process. For example, first converting the alkyne into a carbonyl via hydrogenation and then oxidation.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the options again, all of them have NaNH2 and some alkylating agent as the first step. So, perhaps the first step is to form an extended alkyne.

After that, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, creating a longer chain.

Then, some kind of cleavage (like ozonolysis) is done to form carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. (H2/Pd) → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis would need a double bond, but this molecule doesn't have any. So, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a double bond? No, H2/Pd would reduce triple bonds to single bonds, not create double bonds.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in step 3, ozonolysis is applied to a different part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule has a cyclohexene ring, then ozonolysis would cleave that. But the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane with a triple bond. So, I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the cyclohexane ring is opened or modified in some way to form a diene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

But I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps involve adding a cyclohexyl group through a substitution reaction.

Wait, in option D, step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, the acetylide is formed, then methanol might act as a methylating agent, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with a Grignard reagent, but that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps after adding a methyl group (step 1), the alkyne is hydrogenated to a single bond, making a longer chain. Then, perhaps an elimination step forms a double bond elsewhere, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule has a substituent that is a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a ketone, then reducing it to a secondary alcohol, and then oxidizing part of it to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule's substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, maybe the steps involve forming a cyclohexanol group, which is then attached to the main ring.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Let me go through option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: forms R-C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne to R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: Ozonolysis. But after step 2, it's R-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is an alkane. Ozonolysis won't react. So, this can't be right.

Hmm.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol: form an acetylide, then perhaps react with methanol to form an ether, R-C≡C-OCH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3: perhaps deprotonate something or induce elimination. Maybe eliminate to form a triple bond again?

3. O3/(CH3)2S: if there's a double bond now, would cleave it.

4. NH4OH: workup.

But I'm not sure how this forms the target molecule.

Option B's steps:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: R-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/liq. NH3: perhaps elimination to form a triple bond, or deprotonate something.

3. O3/H2O: cleaves double bonds.

4. NH4OH: workup.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the molecule is R-C≡C-CH2CH3. Step 2: Li in NH3. I'm not certain what that would do. Maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that's usually for aromatic rings.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a deprotonation to form a strong base, which could then eliminate to form a double bond. So, R-C≡C-CH2CH3 → R-C≡C-CH2CH2^- Li^+ → upon elimination, could form R-C≡C-CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere. But I'm not sure.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis would cleave the double bond, forming carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing how this would lead to the target molecule.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the oxidation state changes.

The target molecule has an aldehyde group, which is a higher oxidation state than the starting alkyne. So, perhaps there's an oxidation step somewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then into an aldehyde.

Wait, but how?

Another thought: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a cyclohexanol group, which is then oxidized to a ketone, and then further processed.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis: Wait, no double bond. So, perhaps this isn't the path.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but how to hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene? Because H2 with a catalyst like Lindlar's would give cis addition, but I don't see Lindlar's in the options. The options have H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne all the way to a single bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → (NaNH2, CH3Cl) → R-C≡C-CH3.

2. Hydrogenated → R-CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. Ozonolysis: Not possible, as no double bond.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, despite the confusion.

Because step 3 in option C is ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis usually cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups, but if there's no alkene, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to form a cis-alkene. But with H2/Pd, it would go all the way to a single bond, not a cis-alkene.

Wait, unless the hydrogenation is partial. But I don't think Pd would stop at the alkene stage; it would fully hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

Hmm.

Another approach: The target molecule has a secondary alcohol and an aldehyde. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then reduced to a secondary alcohol, and then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is oxidized to a diketone, then subjected to some cleavage.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Based on the options and the reaction steps, I think option C is the correct sequence because:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride add a methyl group to the alkyne.

2. Hydrogenation reduces the alkyne to a single bond, forming a longer chain.

3. Ozonolysis is not applicable here, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a longer chain, and ozonolysis isn't the right step. I'm really not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

But without more clarity, I think I'll have to make an educated guess.

Wait, the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH. So, perhaps the steps involve forming an epoxide, then opening it with a nucleophile like OH-.

But I don't see epoxidation reagents in the options.

Another idea: Perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group, then subjected to a nucleophilic addition to add the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

After all this, I think the correct sequence is option C.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde group and a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely form an extended alkyne.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to a single bond.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, possibly for elimination.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O suggests hydration, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride add an ethyl group to the alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or induce elimination, but the role of this step is unclear.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O cleaves double bonds, but the molecule lacks a double bond after step 2.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent, but the sequence does not align with the target structure.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride add a methyl group to the alkyne, forming R-C≡C-CH₃.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the alkyne to R-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S suggests ozonolysis, but the molecule is an alkane after step 2, so ozonolysis would not react.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, but its role is unclear in this context.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol likely form an acetylide, which may react with methanol to form an ether (R-C≡C-OCH₃).
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could deprotonate or induce elimination, but the exact transformation is unclear.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S suggests ozonolysis, but the molecule lacks a double bond.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target structure.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the target structure. However, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible, as it involves steps that could potentially lead to the formation of the target molecule, despite some ambiguities in the later steps.

**Answer: C**
