Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems, and I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, let me think. I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their velocities are related to their masses. 

The question gives me the periods of the eclipses for both systems. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Wait, but in binary systems, the orbital period is the same for both stars because they're orbiting each other. So that part makes sense.

Then there's the radial velocity (RV) data. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. System_2's are 15 and 10. I think the RV amplitude is the maximum speed each star moves towards or away from us. But how does that relate to the masses?

I recall that in a binary system, the more massive star moves slower, right? Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So the star with the higher mass has a smaller orbit, hence smaller velocity. So in system_1, one star has a higher velocity (10 km/s) and the other lower (5 km/s). So the 10 km/s star is less massive, and the 5 km/s is more massive? Wait, no, wait. Because if the more massive star moves slower, then the larger velocity would correspond to the less massive star. So in system_1, the ratio of the velocities would be 10:5, which is 2:1. But since the mass ratio is inverse, the masses would be in a 1:2 ratio.

Wait, let me make sure. The mass ratio m1/m2 = (v2)/(v1), where v1 and v2 are the velocities of each star. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if star A has velocity vA and star B has vB, then m_A/m_B = vB / vA, right? Because m1*v1 = m2*v2, so m1/m2 = v2/v1.

So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. Let me call star A the one with 10, star B with 5. Then m_A/m_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So m_A is half of m_B. So the total mass of system_1 is m_A + m_B = 0.5 m_B + m_B = 1.5 m_B.

Similarly, for system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. Let me call them v1=15 and v2=10. Then m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So m1 is two-thirds of m2. So the total mass is m1 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3)m2.

Wait, but how do I find the ratio of system_1's mass to system_2's mass? Let me see.

So system_1's mass is 1.5 m_B, and system_2's mass is (5/3) m2. Hmm, but I need to relate them. Wait, but I'm not sure if I can do that directly because m_B and m2 are different variables. Oh wait, perhaps I should express each system's mass in terms of their own velocities and then find the ratio.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the total mass. Kepler's law in binary systems is P² = (4π²/G(M1+M2)) * a³, where a is the separation. But I'm not sure about the exact form.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the masses in each system is known. So for system_1, m1/m2 = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 m2a, where m2a is the mass of the second star in system_1. So the total mass for system_1 is m1 + m2a = 0.5 m2a + m2a = 1.5 m2a.

Similarly, for system_2, m1/m2 = 2/3. So m1 = (2/3) m2b, where m2b is the mass of the second star in system_2. Total mass is (2/3 m2b) + m2b = (5/3) m2b.

But I don't know m2a and m2b. How can I find the ratio of the total masses of system_1 to system_2?

Wait, but the periods are given. P is 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. How does the period relate to the mass?

The period is the same for both stars, so that's given. Hmm, but perhaps using the velocity and period, I can find the size of the orbit or something else.

Wait, I think the velocity of each star is related to their orbit. The velocity is v = 2πa / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But since the stars orbit their common center of mass, the actual distance between them is a_total = a1 + a2, where a1 and a2 are the individual semi-major axes. And the total mass is M = m1 + m2.

Also, from the velocity, v = (2π a_i) / P. And since m1 a1 = m2 a2, because the center of mass is at the balance point.

So, a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * a_total and a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) * a_total.

But maybe a better approach is to consider that for each system, the velocity ratio is known, so the mass ratio is known.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass function and then relate the two systems.

Wait, another approach: The mass function in binary stars is a way to relate the observed velocities with the masses. The mass function f(M) = (v² P) / (2π G), but I'm not sure if that's the right way here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the ratio of the masses is the inverse of the velocity ratio. So in system_1, the two masses are in a 1:2 ratio. Let's say m1 = m, m2 = 2m, so total is 3m.

In system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10, so their masses are in a 2:3 ratio. So m1=2n, m2=3n, total is 5n.

Now, the problem is to find (3m) / (5n) = ?

But how do I relate m and n between the two systems? I think we need another equation involving the period.

Wait, the period is the same for both stars in a system, so for each system we can write an equation involving the period.

The period P is linked to the orbital velocities and the separation. For each system, the sum of the velocities times the period should equal the circumference of their orbits, i.e., v1 * P = 2π a1, and v2 * P = 2π a2.

Wait, let me think again. The velocity of each star is v = 2π a / P, where a is the radius of their orbit around the center of mass.

But the separation between the two stars is a1 + a2, where a1 is the orbit of star 1, a2 of star 2.

Also, from the center of mass, m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So, a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * (a1 + a2) = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * a_total.

Similarly, a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) * a_total.

But the velocities are v1 = 2π a1 / P, and v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So, v1 / v2 = (a1) / (a2) ) = (m2 / m1 ) → because a1/a2 = m2/m1.

Wait, that makes sense because the more massive star has a smaller orbit, so the velocity is lower. So, v1 / v2 = m2 / m1.

Wait, because a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) a_total, and a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) a_total. So, a1/a2 = m2/m1. So, v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P → v1/v2 = a1/a2 = m2/m1.

So, from the velocities, we can get the mass ratio.

In system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So, the velocity ratio is v1/v2 = 10/5 = 2. So, m2/m1 = 2 → m2 = 2 m1. So the mass ratio is m1 : m2 = 1 : 2. So m1 = m, m2 = 2m. Total mass is 3m.

In system_2, velocities are 15 and 10 → v1/v2 = 15/10 = 1.5. So, m2/m1 = 1.5 → m2 = 1.5 m1. So mass ratio is m1 : m2 = 1 : 1.5 = 2 : 3. So m1 = 2n, m2 = 3n. Total mass is 5n.

Now, the question is, what is the ratio (3m) / (5n) = ?

But how to find m and n? Because we need another equation. Oh, wait, Kepler's third law. The period is related to the total mass and the size of the orbit.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ (a_total)^3 (M_total), where M_total is m1 + m2.

Wait, actually, the correct form of Kepler's third law for a binary system is:

P² = (4π²) / (G (M1 + M2)) ) * a³,

where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit (the separation between the two stars).

But the problem is, I don't know the actual separation a for either system.

Hmm, but maybe I can relate the two systems using their periods and the velocities.

Wait, I have the period for each system. Let's see.

For system_1, P = 2 years. For system_2, P = 1 year.

But how about the velocity of each star and the period? Because the velocity is 2π a_i / P, and a_i is the semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass.

Alternatively, the sum of the two a_i is the total separation a_total.

So for system_1:

v1 = 2π a1 / P1,

v2 = 2π a2 / P1,

and a1 + a2 = a_total_1.

Similarly, for system_2:

v1' = 2π a1' / P2,

v2' = 2π a2' / P2,

and a1' + a2' = a_total_2.

But I'm not sure if I can get the a's from this. Maybe I can find the ratio of a_total for the two systems.

Wait, maybe the idea is that the ratio of the velocities is known, and the mass ratio is known, and the period is given. So perhaps I can relate the total mass to the velocities and period.

Wait, in each system, the total mass can be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period.

From the velocities, we can find the a_i for each star.

v1 = (2π a1) / P,

so a1 = (v1 P) / (2π),

same for a2 = (v2 P) / (2π).

But a1 + a2 = a_total.

So, a_total = (v1 P + v2 P) / (2 π) = P (v1 + v2) / (2 π).

But from Kepler's law,

P² = (4 π² G)⁻¹ (a_total)^3 (M_total).

Wait, perhaps I can express M_total in terms of the velocities and P.

Let me do that.

Let me rearrange Kepler's law:

M_total = (4 π² a_total^3) / (G P²).

But a_total is from above: a_total = (P (v1 + v2)) / (2 π).

So substituting a_total into M_total:

M_total = (4 π² [ (P (v1 + v2) )/(2 π) ]^3 ) / ( G P² ) )

Let me compute this.

First, [ P (v1 + v2) / (2 π) ]^3 = [ P (v1 + v2) )^3 ] / (8 π^3 )

So,

M_total = (4 π²) * [ P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 / (8 π^3) ) ] / ( G P² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π² * P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 / (8 π^3) ) = (4/8) * (π² / π^3) * P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 )

Which is (0.5) * (1/π) ) * P^3 (v1 + v2)^3.

So,

M_total = [ (0.5) * (1/π) * P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 ) ] / ( G P² )

Simplify,

= (0.5 * (1/π) ) * P (v1 + v2)^3 / ( G )

So,

M_total = (P (v1 + v2)^3 ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, that's interesting. So the total mass of the system is proportional to P (v1 + v2)^3.

Wait, because G is a constant, so for each system, M_total is proportional to P (v1 + v2)^3.

So for system_1, M1 = k * P1 (v1 + v2)^3,

and for system_2, M2 = k * P2 (v1' + v2')^3,

where k is a constant (1/(2 π G)).

So the ratio M1/M2 = [ P1 (v1 + v2)^3 ] / [ P2 (v1' + v2')^3 ]

So let's plug in the numbers.

For system_1:

P1 = 2 years,

v1 = 10 km/s,

v2 = 5 km/s.

v1 + v2 = 15 km/s.

So numerator: 2 * (15)^3 = 2 * 3375 = 6750.

For system_2:

P2 = 1 year,

v1' =15, v2' =10 → sum 25.

Denominator: 1 * (25)^3 = 1 * 15625 = 15625.

So,

M1/M2 = (6750) / (15625) = let's compute this.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625.

270 ÷ 625 = 0.432.

So approximately 0.432.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6, and so on.

So 0.432 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.6. So the factor is about 0.43, which is approximately 0.4.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, M_total = [ P (v1 + v2)^3 ] / (2 π G )

So the ratio M1 / M2 = [ P1 (v1+v2)^3 ] / [ P2 (v1' + v2')^3 ]

So for system_1:

P1 =2,

v_sum1 = 10+5=15.

v_sum1^3 = 3375.

So numerator: 2 * 3375 = 6750.

System_2:

P2 =1,

v_sum2=15+10=25.

v_sum2^3=15625.

Denominator:1 * 15625=15625.

So 6750 /15625 = ?

Let me compute that.

6750 divided by 15625.

Well, 15625 is 25^3. 6750 is 2 * 3^3 * 5^3.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as a fraction.

6750 /15625 = (6750 ÷ 25) / (15625 ÷25) ) → 270 / 625.

270 ÷ 625 = 0.432.

Yes, that's correct.

So M1 is about 0.432 times M2. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. Wait, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So 0.43 times as massive, so system_1 is about 0.4 times the mass of system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 0.4 → which would mean system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

But the question asks, 'by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?' So if system_1 is 0.4 times the mass of system_2, then it's 0.4 times as massive, meaning it is less massive. So the factor is less than 1, so the correct answer would be option A, ~0.4.

Wait, but wait, let me check the initial assumption. Because when I used the formula, I assumed that M_total is proportional to P (v_sum)^3.

Wait, but let me think: for each system,

M_total = [ P (v1 + v2)^3 ] / (2 π G )

So M_total is proportional to P (v_sum)^3.

So the ratio M1/M2 is [ (2 * (15)^3 ) ] / [ (1 * 25^3) ) ] = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625) ) = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

So that's correct.

So the masses are in the ratio of approximately 0.432. The options are A) ~0.4 and B) ~0.6. So 0.432 is closer to 0.4, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So 0.432 is about 0.43, so closer to 0.4 than to 0.6. So the correct answer is option A.

To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between the total mass of a binary system and its orbital period, as well as the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes of the stars. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto P (v_1 + v_2)^3
\]

where \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(v_1 + v_2\) is the sum of the RV amplitudes of the two stars.

### Step 1: Calculate the total mass for each system
For system_1:
- Orbital period: \(P_1 = 2\) years
- RV amplitudes: \(v_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, v_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Sum of RV amplitudes: \(v_1 + v_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Total mass contribution: 
  \[
  M_1 \propto P_1 (v_1 + v_2)^3 = 2 \cdot 15^3 = 2 \cdot 3375 = 6750
  \]

For system_2:
- Orbital period: \(P_2 = 1\) year
- RV amplitudes: \(v_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, v_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Sum of RV amplitudes: \(v_1 + v_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Total mass contribution:
  \[
  M_2 \propto P_2 (v_1 + v_2)^3 = 1 \cdot 25^3 = 1 \cdot 15625 = 15625
  \]

### Step 2: Compute the mass ratio
The ratio of the total masses is given by:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{P_1 (v_1 + v_2)^3}{P_2 (v_1' + v_2')^3} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The mass ratio \(M_1 / M_2 \approx 0.432\), which means system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2. Since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, the answer is approximately 0.4.

Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems, and I need to figure out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Hmm, let me think. I remember that binary stars orbit a common center of mass, and their velocities are related to their masses.

So the 10 km/s star is less massive, and the 5 km/s is more massive? Wait, no, wait. Because if the more massive star moves slower, then the larger velocity would correspond to the less massive star. So in system_1, the ratio of the velocities would be 10:5, which is 2:1. But since the mass ratio is inverse, the masses would be in a 1:2 ratio.

Wait, let me make sure. The mass ratio m1/m2 = (v2)/(v1), where v1 and v2 are the velocities of each star. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if star A has velocity vA and star B has vB, then m_A/m_B = vB / vA, right? Because m1*v1 = m2*v2, so m1/m2 = v2/v1.

So for system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. Let me call star A the one with 10, star B with 5. Then m_A/m_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So m_A is half of m_B. So the total mass of system_1 is m_A + m_B = 0.5 m_B + m_B = 1.5 m_B.

Similarly, for system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10. Let me call them v1=15 and v2=10. Then m1/m2 = v2/v1 = 10/15 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So m1 is two-thirds of m2. So the total mass is m1 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3)m2.

Wait, but how do I find the ratio of system_1's mass to system_2's mass? Let me see.

So system_1's mass is 1.5 m_B, and system_2's mass is (5/3) m2. Hmm, but I need to relate them. Wait, but I'm not sure if I can do that directly because m_B and m2 are different variables. Oh wait, perhaps I should express each system's mass in terms of their own velocities and then find the ratio.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the masses in each system is known. So for system_1, m1/m2 = 0.5. So m1 = 0.5 m2a, where m2a is the mass of the second star in system_1. So the total mass for system_1 is m1 + m2a = 0.5 m2a + m2a = 1.5 m2a.

Similarly, for system_2, m1/m2 = 2/3. So m1 = (2/3) m2b, where m2b is the mass of the second star in system_2. Total mass is (2/3 m2b) + m2b = (5/3) m2b.

But I don't know m2a and m2b. How can I find the ratio of the total masses of system_1 to system_2?

Wait, but the periods are given. P is 2 years for system_1 and 1 year for system_2. How does the period relate to the mass?

The period is the same for both stars, so that's given. Hmm, but perhaps using the velocity and period, I can find the size of the orbit or something else.

Wait, I think the velocity of each star is related to their orbit. The velocity is v = 2πa / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.

Also, from the velocity, v = (2π a_i) / P. And since m1 a1 = m2 a2, because the center of mass is at the balance point.

So, a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * a_total and a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) * a_total.

But maybe a better approach is to consider that for each system, the velocity ratio is known, so the mass ratio is known.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass function and then relate the two systems.

Wait, another approach: The mass function in binary stars is a way to relate the observed velocities with the masses. The mass function f(M) = (v² P) / (2π G), but I'm not sure if that's the right way here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the ratio of the masses is the inverse of the velocity ratio. So in system_1, the two masses are in a 1:2 ratio. Let's say m1 = m, m2 = 2m, so total is 3m.

In system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10, so their masses are in a 2:3 ratio. So m1=2n, m2=3n, total is 5n.

Now, the problem is to find (3m) / (5n) = ?

But how do I relate m and n between the two systems? I think we need another equation involving the period.

Wait, the period is the same for both stars in a system, so for each system we can write an equation involving the period.

The period P is linked to the orbital velocities and the separation. For each system, the sum of the velocities times the period should equal the circumference of their orbits, i.e., v1 * P = 2π a1, and v2 * P = 2π a2.

Wait, let me think again. The velocity of each star is v = 2π a / P, where a is the radius of their orbit around the center of mass.

But the separation between the two stars is a1 + a2, where a1 is the orbit of star 1, a2 of star 2.

Also, from the center of mass, m1 a1 = m2 a2.

So, a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * (a1 + a2) = (m2/(m1 + m2)) * a_total.

Similarly, a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) * a_total.

But the velocities are v1 = 2π a1 / P, and v2 = 2π a2 / P.

So, v1 / v2 = (a1) / (a2) ) = (m2 / m1 ) → because a1/a2 = m2/m1.

Wait, that makes sense because the more massive star has a smaller orbit, so the velocity is lower. So, v1 / v2 = m2 / m1.

Wait, because a1 = (m2/(m1 + m2)) a_total, and a2 = (m1/(m1 + m2)) a_total. So, a1/a2 = m2/m1. So, v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2 = 2π a2 / P → v1/v2 = a1/a2 = m2/m1.

So, from the velocities, we can get the mass ratio.

In system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So, the velocity ratio is v1/v2 = 10/5 = 2. So, m2/m1 = 2 → m2 = 2 m1. So the mass ratio is m1 : m2 = 1 : 2. So m1 = m, m2 = 2m. Total mass is 3m.

In system_2, velocities are 15 and 10 → v1/v2 = 15/10 = 1.5. So, m2/m1 = 1.5 → m2 = 1.5 m1. So mass ratio is m1 : m2 = 1 : 1.5 = 2 : 3. So m1 = 2n, m2 = 3n. Total mass is 5n.

Now, the question is, what is the ratio (3m) / (5n) = ?

But how to find m and n? Because we need another equation. Oh, wait, Kepler's third law. The period is related to the total mass and the size of the orbit.

Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G)⁻¹ (a_total)^3 (M_total), where M_total is m1 + m2.

Wait, actually, the correct form of Kepler's third law for a binary system is:

P² = (4π²) / (G (M1 + M2)) ) * a³,

where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit (the separation between the two stars).

But the problem is, I don't know the actual separation a for either system.

Hmm, but maybe I can relate the two systems using their periods and the velocities.

Wait, I have the period for each system. Let's see.

For system_1, P = 2 years. For system_2, P = 1 year.

But how about the velocity of each star and the period? Because the velocity is 2π a_i / P, and a_i is the semi-major axis of each star's orbit around the center of mass.

Alternatively, the sum of the two a_i is the total separation a_total.

So for system_1:

v1 = 2π a1 / P1,

v2 = 2π a2 / P1,

and a1 + a2 = a_total_1.

Similarly, for system_2:

v1' = 2π a1' / P2,

v2' = 2π a2' / P2,

and a1' + a2' = a_total_2.

But I'm not sure if I can get the a's from this. Maybe I can find the ratio of a_total for the two systems.

Wait, maybe the idea is that the ratio of the velocities is known, and the mass ratio is known, and the period is given. So perhaps I can relate the total mass to the velocities and period.

Wait, in each system, the total mass can be expressed in terms of the velocities and the period.

From the velocities, we can find the a_i for each star.

v1 = (2π a1) / P,

so a1 = (v1 P) / (2π),

same for a2 = (v2 P) / (2π).

But a1 + a2 = a_total.

So, a_total = (v1 P + v2 P) / (2 π) = P (v1 + v2) / (2 π).

But from Kepler's law,

P² = (4 π² G)⁻¹ (a_total)^3 (M_total).

Wait, perhaps I can express M_total in terms of the velocities and P.

Let me do that.

Let me rearrange Kepler's law:

M_total = (4 π² a_total^3) / (G P²).

But a_total is from above: a_total = (P (v1 + v2)) / (2 π).

So substituting a_total into M_total:

M_total = (4 π² [ (P (v1 + v2) )/(2 π) ]^3 ) / ( G P² ) )

Let me compute this.

First, [ P (v1 + v2) / (2 π) ]^3 = [ P (v1 + v2) )^3 ] / (8 π^3 )

So,

M_total = (4 π²) * [ P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 / (8 π^3) ) ] / ( G P² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π² * P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 / (8 π^3) ) = (4/8) * (π² / π^3) * P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 )

Which is (0.5) * (1/π) ) * P^3 (v1 + v2)^3.

So,

M_total = [ (0.5) * (1/π) * P^3 (v1 + v2)^3 ) ] / ( G P² )

Simplify,

= (0.5 * (1/π) ) * P (v1 + v2)^3 / ( G )

So,

M_total = (P (v1 + v2)^3 ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, that's interesting. So the total mass of the system is proportional to P (v1 + v2)^3.

Wait, because G is a constant, so for each system, M_total is proportional to P (v1 + v2)^3.

So for system_1, M1 = k * P1 (v1 + v2)^3,

and for system_2, M2 = k * P2 (v1' + v2')^3,

where k is a constant (1/(2 π G)).

So the ratio M1/M2 = [ P1 (v1 + v2)^3 ] / [ P2 (v1' + v2')^3 ]

So let's plug in the numbers.

For system_1:

P1 = 2 years,

v1 = 10 km/s,

v2 = 5 km/s.

v1 + v2 = 15 km/s.

So numerator: 2 * (15)^3 = 2 * 3375 = 6750.

For system_2:

P2 = 1 year,

v1' =15, v2' =10 → sum 25.

Denominator: 1 * (25)^3 = 1 * 15625 = 15625.

So,

M1/M2 = (6750) / (15625) = let's compute this.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625.

270 ÷ 625 = 0.432.

So approximately 0.432.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6, and so on.

So 0.432 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.6. So the factor is about 0.43, which is approximately 0.4.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, M_total = [ P (v1 + v2)^3 ] / (2 π G )

So the ratio M1 / M2 = [ P1 (v1+v2)^3 ] / [ P2 (v1' + v2')^3 ]

So for system_1:

P1 =2,

v_sum1 = 10+5=15.

v_sum1^3 = 3375.

So numerator: 2 * 3375 = 6750.

System_2:

P2 =1,

v_sum2=15+10=25.

v_sum2^3=15625.

Denominator:1 * 15625=15625.

So 6750 /15625 = ?

Let me compute that.

6750 divided by 15625.

Well, 15625 is 25^3. 6750 is 2 * 3^3 * 5^3.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as a fraction.

6750 /15625 = (6750 ÷ 25) / (15625 ÷25) ) → 270 / 625.

270 ÷ 625 = 0.432.

Yes, that's correct.

So M1 is about 0.432 times M2. So system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive. Wait, but the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So 0.43 times as massive, so system_1 is about 0.4 times the mass of system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~ 0.4 → which would mean system_1 is 0.4 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive.

But the question asks, 'by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?' So if system_1 is 0.4 times the mass of system_2, then it's 0.4 times as massive, meaning it is less massive. So the factor is less than 1, so the correct answer would be option A, ~0.4.

Wait, but wait, let me check the initial assumption. Because when I used the formula, I assumed that M_total is proportional to P (v_sum)^3.

Wait, but let me think: for each system,

M_total = [ P (v1 + v2)^3 ] / (2 π G )

So M_total is proportional to P (v_sum)^3.

So the ratio M1/M2 is [ (2 * (15)^3 ) ] / [ (1 * 25^3) ) ] = (2 * 3375) / (1 * 15625) ) = 6750 / 15625 = 0.432.

So that's correct.

So the masses are in the ratio of approximately 0.432. The options are A) ~0.4 and B) ~0.6. So 0.432 is closer to 0.4, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

So 0.432 is about 0.43, so closer to 0.4 than to 0.6. So the correct answer is option A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between the total mass of a binary system and its orbital period, as well as the radial velocity (RV) amplitudes of the stars. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} \propto P (v_1 + v_2)^3
\]

where \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(v_1 + v_2\) is the sum of the RV amplitudes of the two stars.

### Step 1: Calculate the total mass for each system
For system_1:
- Orbital period: \(P_1 = 2\) years
- RV amplitudes: \(v_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, v_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Sum of RV amplitudes: \(v_1 + v_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Total mass contribution: 
  \[
  M_1 \propto P_1 (v_1 + v_2)^3 = 2 \cdot 15^3 = 2 \cdot 3375 = 6750
  \]

For system_2:
- Orbital period: \(P_2 = 1\) year
- RV amplitudes: \(v_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, v_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Sum of RV amplitudes: \(v_1 + v_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Total mass contribution:
  \[
  M_2 \propto P_2 (v_1 + v_2)^3 = 1 \cdot 25^3 = 1 \cdot 15625 = 15625
  \]

### Step 2: Compute the mass ratio
The ratio of the total masses is given by:
\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{P_1 (v_1 + v_2)^3}{P_2 (v_1' + v_2')^3} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The mass ratio \(M_1 / M_2 \approx 0.432\), which means system_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2. Since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, the answer is approximately 0.4.

### Final Answer:
