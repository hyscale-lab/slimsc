Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles, like pions and kaons, which are made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are unstable particles, so they decay quickly. The mean decay distance is what we're after here.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, looking like they're on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. That makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distance shouldn't be too big.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But since mesons are bosons, I'm not sure if that affects this directly. Wait, no, the decay distance is more about the particle's speed and lifetime. The formula for mean decay length is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau), the average speed (v), but wait, maybe more accurately, it's (v * gamma) * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Hmm, I might have to recall the exact formula.

Wait, another approach. The mean proper lifetime (tau) can be found using the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least ħ/2. So Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the lifetime uncertainty. So τ ≈ ħ / (Γ). Wait, no, more precise: Γ is the total decay width, and Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, no, I think it's Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ). Or perhaps τ is ħ times the inverse of Γ, but I might need to double-check the units.

Wait, dimensions are important. Γ has units of MeV, which is energy. ħ has units of MeV·s. So if Γ is in energy, and ħ is in energy*time, then ħ/Γ would have units of time, which is correct for tau.

So, let me write that down:

tau = ħ / (Γ)

But wait, I think the actual relation is Γ ≈ ħ / tau, so tau ≈ ħ / Γ. No, wait, that can't be right because if Γ is big, the lifetime is short. So yes, tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but sometimes the width is given in energy, and the lifetime is related via Γ = ħ * (1/tau). So yes, tau = ħ / (Γ).

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think in terms of units. Suppose Γ is in GeV (or MeV), and ħ is in GeV·s. So ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, then tau is ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds. Wait, that seems very short. Hmm.

Wait no, wait a second. Let me get the units right. Oh wait, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So yes, if Γ is 0.32 GeV, then tau is about 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0568e-24 seconds. That's a very short lifetime.

Once I have tau, I need to find how far the meson travels before decaying. The distance L is the speed v multiplied by the lifetime tau. But wait, the meson is moving at a relativistic speed, so I should probably consider its velocity and gamma factor. Because the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

So the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma). Then, the lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0. And the distance is L = v * tau. But v is approximately c for a high-energy particle. So L = c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the mean lifetime is already considering the particle's motion, so maybe the proper approach is to calculate gamma first. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E / (m c^2). Wait, E is the total energy, which is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

But wait, how does that tie into the lifetime and decay length? The proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. Then, the dilated lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

So the decay length L is v * tau. But v ≈ c, so L ≈ c * tau = c * gamma * tau_0.

But wait, let's get the numbers right.

First, compute tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Given that Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_0 = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666667.

So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Then, L = c * tau.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = 4.113e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close to this number. Option C is 5.02e-15, which is about 25% higher, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the steps with more precise numbers.

Compute tau_0:

Gamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma factor:

E = 8 GeV = 8 * 1e9 eV.

Mass m = 1.2 GeV = 1.2 * 1e9 eV.

Wait, but when calculating gamma, the units in E and m should be in the same energy unit. Since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, gamma is E / (m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So gamma is 6.6666667.

tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Then L = c * tau = (3e8 m/s) * 1.371e-23 s = 4.113e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, but I get 4.113e-15. There's a slight discrepancy here. Did I miss something in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the value of ħ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me use that exact value for more precise calculation.

tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666666667.

So tau = 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24) / 3.

20 * 2.056875e-24 = 4.11375e-23.

Divide by 3: 4.11375e-23 /3 ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm. None of the options exactly match 4.11375e-15, but option B is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower. Option C is 5.02e-15, which is higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another approach: The mean decay distance L is given by L = c * gamma * (tau), where tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, no. The proper lifetime tau_0 is (hbar)/Gamma, and the lifetime in lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So L = v * gamma * tau_0. But for high-energy particles, v is approximately c, so L ≈ c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but let me recast the formula. The mean decay length is often written as L = c * gamma * beta * tau_0. But since beta is v/c, and for high gamma, beta is approximately 1. So it's roughly c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but wait. Another formula states that the mean proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma). So the lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau_0. Then, the distance is v * gamma tau_0. Since v ≈ c, L ≈ c gamma tau_0.

So substituting, L = c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

So let's compute that.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So L = c * (8 GeV / (1.2 GeV)) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV)

Simplify the terms:

c = 3e8 m/s

gamma = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * (20/3) * (6.582e-25 s * GeV) / (0.32 GeV)

Wait, the GeV units cancel out.

So,

(3e8) * (20/3) * (6.582e-25) / 0.32

Simplify the terms:

3e8 * (20/3) = 3e8 * 6.666666667 ≈ 2e9.

Wait, let's compute step by step.

Compute 3e8 * (20/3) = (3 * 20 / 3) )e8 = 20e8 = 2e9.

Then, 2e9 * 6.582e-25 = (2 * 6.582) e (9 -25) ) = 13.164e-16 = 1.3164e-15.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 2e9 * 6.582e-25.

It's 2e9 *6.582e-25 = (2 *6.582 )e (9-25) )=13.164e-16 = 1.3164e-15.

Then, divide by 0.32.

So 1.3164e-15 / 0.32 ≈ 4.11375e-15 meters.

Again, I get around 4.11e-15 m, but the options are B) 4.0655e-15 and C)5.0223e-15.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me redo the calculation with more precise figures.

Compute L = (c) * gamma * ( ħ / Gamma )

c = 3e8 m/s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.

ħ =6.582e-25 GeV s.

So,

L = 3e8 * (6.666666667) * (6.582e-25) / 0.32

Let me compute numerator first:

3e8 * 6.666666667 = 1.99999999999e9 ≈ 2e9.

Then, 2e9 * 6.582e-25 = (2 *6.582 ) e (9-25) )=13.164e-16.

Now, 13.164e-16 / 0.32 = (13.164 / 0.32 )e-16.

13.164 divided by 0.32: Let's compute.

0.32 *41=13.12. 13.164-13.12=0.044. So 41.1375.

So 41.1375e-16 =4.11375e-15 m.

Same result. So the calculation is consistent.

But the options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16.

My calculation gives about 4.11375e-15 m. The closest option is B:4.0655e-15, but it's a bit lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check gamma.

E is the total energy, which is 8 GeV.

Mass m is 1.2 GeV.

So gamma = E/(m c^2). Wait, but wait, the units for E and m are in GeV, so when we take E/(m c^2), the c^2 is in (GeV/c^2) * c^2, which gives GeV. So, the units for gamma are indeed unitless, as expected.

So 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of tau_0 is wrong. Let me check.

tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but perhaps it should be treated as 320 GeV? No, that can't be right because 320 GeV is way larger than the mass of 1.2 GeV, which would imply a very short lifetime. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute more precisely the value of ħ. Let me check the exact value. I think that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the width is given in MeV, but I treated it as GeV, but I think I converted it correctly. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should use the natural line width formula, which relates the width to the lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

But wait, Gamma is the total decay width, which has units of energy, so when you divide ħ (units energy*time) by Gamma (energy), you get time. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

Then, the distance is L = v * tau. Since v ≈c, L= c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, let me compute using exact numbers.

Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma = 8 /1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

So, tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.66666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6 *2.056875e-24 ) + (0.6666666667 *2.056875e-24 )

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

0.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = approximately 1.37125e-24.

Add them: 1.234125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.37125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.508375e-23? Wait, no, wait 1.234125e-23 is 12.34125e-24, plus 1.37125e-24 is 13.7125e-24, which is 1.37125e-23. So tau is 1.37125e-23 s.

Then L = c * tau = 3e8 m/s *1.37125e-23 s = 4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm, same as before. So none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: perhaps the decay length is calculated using the mean lifetime as (v gamma tau_0). Or perhaps I should consider that the width is Gamma, which is the total decay width. So, perhaps Γ is the total energy width, and the lifetime is tau = hbar * (m)/(Gamma), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, another formula I found somewhere: The mean proper lifetime is tau_0 = hbar / (Gamma). Then, the lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. The speed is v = beta c. So, L = v gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0. But beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)), which for gamma=6.6667 is approximately 0.9933.

So, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2/8)^2 ) ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(1 -0.0225 )= sqrt(0.9775 )≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute beta correctly.

beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2) ) = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2 GeV)^2 )/( (8 GeV)^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98869.

So beta is approximately 0.9887. So using beta, the calculation becomes:

L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Earlier, without beta, we got 4.11e-15 m. Now, with beta=0.9887, it would be 0.9887 *4.11e-15 ≈4.06e-15 m.

Ah! That's option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So, that must be the right approach. I think I forgot to include beta in the calculation earlier. So the precise formula is L = v gamma tau_0, where v = beta c.

So, let's recalculate.

L = beta * c * gamma * tau_0.

We have:

beta ≈ 0.9887.

c =3e8 m/s.

gamma =6.6667.

tau_0= 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = 0.9887 *3e8 *6.6667 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute gamma * tau_0: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = beta * c * (gamma tau_0) = 0.9887 *3e8 *1.37125e-23.

Compute 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 4.11375e-15.

Multiply by 0.9887:

4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 ≈ 4.0655e-15 m.

Which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship between the decay width (\( \Gamma \)), the proper lifetime (\( \tau_0 \)), and the relativistic effects. The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime, and
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau_0 \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), the proper lifetime is:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \)
The total energy of the particle is \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.225} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau_0 \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we compute:

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \tau_0 \):

\[
\gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

Then, calculate \( c \cdot \gamma \tau_0 \):

\[
c \cdot \gamma \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, include \( \beta \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that mesons are particles, like pions and kaons, which are made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are unstable particles, so they decay quickly. The mean decay distance is what we're after here.

The given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, looking like they're on the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. That makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distance shouldn't be too big.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime. The longer the lifetime, the farther it can travel before decaying. But since mesons are bosons, I'm not sure if that affects this directly. Wait, no, the decay distance is more about the particle's speed and lifetime. The formula for mean decay length is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (tau), the average speed (v), but wait, maybe more accurately, it's (v * gamma) * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Hmm, I might have to recall the exact formula.

Wait, another approach. The mean proper lifetime (tau) can be found using the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is at least ħ/2. So Γ is the energy uncertainty, and τ is the lifetime uncertainty. So τ ≈ ħ / (Γ). Wait, no, more precise: Γ is the total decay width, and Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, no, I think it's Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ). Or perhaps τ is ħ times the inverse of Γ, but I might need to double-check the units.

Wait, dimensions are important. Γ has units of MeV, which is energy. ħ has units of MeV·s. So if Γ is in energy, and ħ is in energy*time, then ħ/Γ would have units of time, which is correct for tau.

So, let me write that down:

tau = ħ / (Γ)

But wait, I think the actual relation is Γ ≈ ħ / tau, so tau ≈ ħ / Γ. No, wait, that can't be right because if Γ is big, the lifetime is short. So yes, tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but sometimes the width is given in energy, and the lifetime is related via Γ = ħ * (1/tau). So yes, tau = ħ / (Γ).

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think in terms of units. Suppose Γ is in GeV (or MeV), and ħ is in GeV·s. So ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, then tau is ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds. Wait, that seems very short. Hmm.

Wait no, wait a second. Let me get the units right. Oh wait, ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. So yes, if Γ is 0.32 GeV, then tau is about 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0568e-24 seconds. That's a very short lifetime.

Once I have tau, I need to find how far the meson travels before decaying. The distance L is the speed v multiplied by the lifetime tau. But wait, the meson is moving at a relativistic speed, so I should probably consider its velocity and gamma factor. Because the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

So the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma). Then, the lab frame lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0. And the distance is L = v * tau. But v is approximately c for a high-energy particle. So L = c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the mean lifetime is already considering the particle's motion, so maybe the proper approach is to calculate gamma first. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E / (m c^2). Wait, E is the total energy, which is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

So gamma is about 6.6667.

But wait, how does that tie into the lifetime and decay length? The proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma. Then, the dilated lifetime is tau = gamma * tau_0.

So the decay length L is v * tau. But v ≈ c, so L ≈ c * tau = c * gamma * tau_0.

But wait, let's get the numbers right.

First, compute tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Given that Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau_0 = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.666667.

So tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 seconds.

Then, L = c * tau.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = 4.113e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is close to this number. Option C is 5.02e-15, which is about 25% higher, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the steps with more precise numbers.

Compute tau_0:

Gamma = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = (6.582×10^-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma factor:

E = 8 GeV = 8 * 1e9 eV.

Mass m = 1.2 GeV = 1.2 * 1e9 eV.

Wait, but when calculating gamma, the units in E and m should be in the same energy unit. Since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, gamma is E / (m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So gamma is 6.6666667.

tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Then L = c * tau = (3e8 m/s) * 1.371e-23 s = 4.113e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, but I get 4.113e-15. There's a slight discrepancy here. Did I miss something in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the value of ħ. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Let me use that exact value for more precise calculation.

tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6666666667.

So tau = 20/3 * 2.056875e-24 = (20 * 2.056875e-24) / 3.

20 * 2.056875e-24 = 4.11375e-23.

Divide by 3: 4.11375e-23 /3 ≈ 1.37125e-23 s.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s = 4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm. None of the options exactly match 4.11375e-15, but option B is 4.0655e-15, which is a bit lower. Option C is 5.02e-15, which is higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another approach: The mean decay distance L is given by L = c * gamma * (tau), where tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, no. The proper lifetime tau_0 is (hbar)/Gamma, and the lifetime in lab frame is gamma * tau_0. So L = v * gamma * tau_0. But for high-energy particles, v is approximately c, so L ≈ c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but let me recast the formula. The mean decay length is often written as L = c * gamma * beta * tau_0. But since beta is v/c, and for high gamma, beta is approximately 1. So it's roughly c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but wait. Another formula states that the mean proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma). So the lifetime in lab frame is gamma tau_0. Then, the distance is v * gamma tau_0. Since v ≈ c, L ≈ c gamma tau_0.

So substituting, L = c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

So let's compute that.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So L = c * (8 GeV / (1.2 GeV)) * (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV)

Simplify the terms:

c = 3e8 m/s

gamma = 8/1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So,

L = (3e8 m/s) * (20/3) * (6.582e-25 s * GeV) / (0.32 GeV)

Wait, the GeV units cancel out.

So,

(3e8) * (20/3) * (6.582e-25) / 0.32

Simplify the terms:

3e8 * (20/3) = 3e8 * 6.666666667 ≈ 2e9.

Wait, let's compute step by step.

Compute 3e8 * (20/3) = (3 * 20 / 3) )e8 = 20e8 = 2e9.

Then, 2e9 * 6.582e-25 = (2 * 6.582) e (9 -25) ) = 13.164e-16 = 1.3164e-15.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute 2e9 * 6.582e-25.

It's 2e9 *6.582e-25 = (2 *6.582 )e (9-25) )=13.164e-16 = 1.3164e-15.

Then, divide by 0.32.

So 1.3164e-15 / 0.32 ≈ 4.11375e-15 meters.

Again, I get around 4.11e-15 m, but the options are B) 4.0655e-15 and C)5.0223e-15.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me redo the calculation with more precise figures.

Compute L = (c) * gamma * ( ħ / Gamma )

c = 3e8 m/s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

gamma = 8/1.2 = 6.6666666667.

ħ =6.582e-25 GeV s.

So,

L = 3e8 * (6.666666667) * (6.582e-25) / 0.32

Let me compute numerator first:

3e8 * 6.666666667 = 1.99999999999e9 ≈ 2e9.

Then, 2e9 * 6.582e-25 = (2 *6.582 ) e (9-25) )=13.164e-16.

Now, 13.164e-16 / 0.32 = (13.164 / 0.32 )e-16.

13.164 divided by 0.32: Let's compute.

0.32 *41=13.12. 13.164-13.12=0.044. So 41.1375.

So 41.1375e-16 =4.11375e-15 m.

Same result. So the calculation is consistent.

But the options are:

A)5.0223e-16

B)4.0655e-15

C)5.0223e-15

D)4.0655e-16.

My calculation gives about 4.11375e-15 m. The closest option is B:4.0655e-15, but it's a bit lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check gamma.

E is the total energy, which is 8 GeV.

Mass m is 1.2 GeV.

So gamma = E/(m c^2). Wait, but wait, the units for E and m are in GeV, so when we take E/(m c^2), the c^2 is in (GeV/c^2) * c^2, which gives GeV. So, the units for gamma are indeed unitless, as expected.

So 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666... so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of tau_0 is wrong. Let me check.

tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 s.

Yes, that's right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, but perhaps it should be treated as 320 GeV? No, that can't be right because 320 GeV is way larger than the mass of 1.2 GeV, which would imply a very short lifetime. So that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute more precisely the value of ħ. Let me check the exact value. I think that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So that part was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the width is given in MeV, but I treated it as GeV, but I think I converted it correctly. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should use the natural line width formula, which relates the width to the lifetime. The formula is Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Gamma.

But wait, Gamma is the total decay width, which has units of energy, so when you divide ħ (units energy*time) by Gamma (energy), you get time. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ / Gamma, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau_0.

Then, the distance is L = v * tau. Since v ≈c, L= c * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, let me compute using exact numbers.

Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

tau_0 = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s.

gamma = 8 /1.2 = 6.666666666666667.

So, tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.66666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = (6 *2.056875e-24 ) + (0.6666666667 *2.056875e-24 )

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.234125e-23.

0.6666666667 * 2.056875e-24 = approximately 1.37125e-24.

Add them: 1.234125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.37125e-23 + 1.37125e-24 = 1.508375e-23? Wait, no, wait 1.234125e-23 is 12.34125e-24, plus 1.37125e-24 is 13.7125e-24, which is 1.37125e-23. So tau is 1.37125e-23 s.

Then L = c * tau = 3e8 m/s *1.37125e-23 s = 4.11375e-15 m.

Hmm, same as before. So none of the options exactly match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: perhaps the decay length is calculated using the mean lifetime as (v gamma tau_0). Or perhaps I should consider that the width is Gamma, which is the total decay width. So, perhaps Γ is the total energy width, and the lifetime is tau = hbar * (m)/(Gamma), but that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Wait, another formula I found somewhere: The mean proper lifetime is tau_0 = hbar / (Gamma). Then, the lab lifetime is gamma tau_0. The speed is v = beta c. So, L = v gamma tau_0 = beta c gamma tau_0. But beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)), which for gamma=6.6667 is approximately 0.9933.

So, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2/8)^2 ) ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(1 -0.0225 )= sqrt(0.9775 )≈ 0.9887.

Wait, let me compute beta correctly.

beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2) ) = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2 GeV)^2 )/( (8 GeV)^2 )) ) = sqrt(1 - (1.44)/(64)) ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225 ) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.98869.

So beta is approximately 0.9887. So using beta, the calculation becomes:

L = beta c gamma tau_0.

Earlier, without beta, we got 4.11e-15 m. Now, with beta=0.9887, it would be 0.9887 *4.11e-15 ≈4.06e-15 m.

Ah! That's option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So, that must be the right approach. I think I forgot to include beta in the calculation earlier. So the precise formula is L = v gamma tau_0, where v = beta c.

So, let's recalculate.

L = beta * c * gamma * tau_0.

We have:

beta ≈ 0.9887.

c =3e8 m/s.

gamma =6.6667.

tau_0= 2.056875e-24 s.

So, L = 0.9887 *3e8 *6.6667 * 2.056875e-24.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute gamma * tau_0: 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, L = beta * c * (gamma tau_0) = 0.9887 *3e8 *1.37125e-23.

Compute 3e8 * 1.37125e-23 = 4.11375e-15.

Multiply by 0.9887:

4.11375e-15 * 0.9887 ≈ 4.0655e-15 m.

Which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship between the decay width (\( \Gamma \)), the proper lifetime (\( \tau_0 \)), and the relativistic effects. The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime, and
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Compute \( \tau_0 \)
The decay width is given as \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Using the reduced Planck constant \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), the proper lifetime is:

\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \gamma \)
The total energy of the particle is \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \beta \)
The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.225} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau_0.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau_0 \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \),

we compute:

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \gamma \tau_0 \):

\[
\gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

Then, calculate \( c \cdot \gamma \tau_0 \):

\[
c \cdot \gamma \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, include \( \beta \):

\[
L = 0.9887 \cdot 4.11375 \times 10^{-15} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
