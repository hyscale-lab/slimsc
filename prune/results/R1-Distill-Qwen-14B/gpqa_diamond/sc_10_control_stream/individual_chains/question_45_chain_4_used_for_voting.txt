Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ² / (2mL²), so each particle's energy levels are multiples of E based on their quantum numbers.

Wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. For a single particle, the energy is E_n = (n²) E, where n is the principal quantum number. So for four particles, each in their own state, their energies add up.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. Oh, right, but in a 1D well, each particle has quantum numbers based on their position (n) and spin (up or down). So each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, so each n level can have 2 particles. So for four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels?

Ground state would be the lowest possible energy, so the first few n's filled up as much as possible. Let's think about the possible states.

Each energy level E_n can hold 2 particles because of spin. So the first level (n=1) can have 2, second (n=2) can have 2, and so on.

So with four particles:

- n=1: 2 particles (each with opposite spins)
- n=2: 2 particles

Wait, that would be four particles total. So the first two energy levels are completely filled.

Wait, but what about the ordering when multiple particles are in higher states?

Wait, but for the system of particles, the total energy is the sum of each individual's energy. So ground state is when as many as possible are in the lowest energy states.

So for four particles, each can take a state with n=1 and n=2, with each n holding two particles.

So the particles would be arranged as two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but that's the total for the ground state? So ground state energy is 10E?

Wait, but wait. No, wait. Each particle's energy is (n²) E. So two particles in n=1 each contribute E, so 2E. Two in n=2 contribute 4E each: 8E. So total is 2E +8E =10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but the question is about the energies of the system's states, not each particle. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, the options don't have 10E as the first option. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E, 15E,18E.

Wait, but the question says "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because for four particles, the ground state isn't 10E. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Each particle can be in a state with quantum number n, and each n can have two spins. So for four particles, the lowest possible configuration is two in n=1 (each with opposite spins), two in n=2.

So total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

But wait, I think I might be mixing up the way the particles are filled. Because for identical fermions, each must have a unique quantum state. So maybe for four particles, they have to occupy different states, but since each energy level can hold two, perhaps the filling is different.

Wait, maybe I should model it as each particle having a unique combination of n and spin. So for four particles, each must have a unique (n, spin) pair.

So the first two particles go into n=1 with opposite spins. The next two can't go into n=1 because the spins are filled, so they go into n=2 with opposite spins.

So yeah, that gives the same as before: 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2.

So ground state energy is 10E. So looking at the options, option D has 10E as first energy, but the first excited state. Wait, no, in the options, the first number is ground state.

Wait, no, the options are the energies for ground, first excited, and second excited. So if ground is 10E, I don't see that as the first option.

Wait, options:

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E

Hmm, but that would mean ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, which would suggest that the particles are in a lower configuration.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, four identical spin-1/2 fermions in the well. The lowest possible energy is when they occupy the lowest possible n's with their spins.

So the first two particles (n=1, spin up and down) make two particles. The next two can't go into n=1 because spins are filled, so they go into n=2.

Wait, so the total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state is 10E.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake because in the ground state, perhaps the particles are arranged in a different way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the particles are arranged with their quantum numbers as (n, spin) but in the lowest possible way. So maybe for four particles, each must have a unique n and spin combination.

Ah, wait, no. Because each n can have two particles (spin up and spin down). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two into n=2.

So the ground state energy is 10E.

So looking at the options, option D has ground state as 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. But I need to see what the first and second excited states would be.

Wait, the next possible state would be when the particles have a higher arrangement. So the first excited state would be when the particles are in the next possible arrangement where one particle's n is increased.

How do the energy levels work when they're not all in the lowest possible n's?

So the ground state is 10E: two in n=1, two in n=2.

The first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to a higher n. But which combination gives the next lowest energy.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, but wait, that would require more energy.

Wait, but let's think about the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, beyond the ground state.

Another approach: For four fermions, each must have a unique (n, spin) state.

Wait, perhaps the filling is as follows:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down)

n=2: two particles (spin up and down)

But that's the ground state.

Wait, but how do you get the first excited state? Maybe you promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So then the configuration would be n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (1 particle), n=3 (1 particle).

Wait, but wait, each n can hold two particles. So if in first excited state, you have one n=3 particle, but then you could have another.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would have the four particles as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Wait, but that would mean the next state up.

Wait, let me think. The total energy for this configuration would be 2*E_1 + 1*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, so that's 15E.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state has a different configuration where higher states are filled in a way that the total energy is lower than 15E.

Alternatively, what if one of the particles moves from n=2 to n=3, but another moves from n=2 to n=2 (no, that's not possible because spin is already filled). Or perhaps another way.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state has three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But that can't be because n=1 can only hold two particles (since they're spin-1/2), so three can't fit. So that's impossible.

Hmm. So perhaps the next possible state after the ground state (10E) is 15E.

Wait, but let me think of the possible energy levels when particles are promoted beyond n=2.

Wait, each particle must have a unique (n, spin). So for four particles, the ground state is all in n=1 and 2.

Now, the first excited state would be when the configuration is n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1). So total energy is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) )= 2 +4 +9 =15 →15E.

Wait, but then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. Maybe to n=3 or n=4.

Wait, but let me think. For the second excited state, what's the next possible higher energy.

Another configuration could be n=1(2), n=2(0), n=3(2), but wait, n=2 can hold two, so if all four are in n=3, but no—because two are spin up and down.

Wait, no, four particles can't all be in the same n because each n can hold two. So the next possible step is to have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (as before), but perhaps another configuration.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So two in n=3, but each with different spins.

Wait, let me think: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3.

So the energy would be 2*(1) + 2*(9) = 2 +18=20 →20E.

That's higher than 15E, so maybe that's the second excited state.

But wait, what's the order of states? So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But looking at the options, option D has second excited as 18E. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and the other n=2 particle moves to n=2. No, that doesn't make sense because each n can hold two.

Wait, maybe I should consider the order in which the particles are filled. Let me think about the energy levels in terms of possible states.

Each particle must have a unique (n, spin) state.

So the ground state is:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down)

n=2: two particles (spin up and down)

Total energy = 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8=10 →10E.

Now, the first excited state: the lowest energy possible higher than 10E, which would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to a higher n.

Wait, but that would require the next possible n, which is 3.

So in the first excited state, we have:

n=1: 2

n=2:1 (since one particle was promoted to n=3)

n=3:1 (the promoted particle)

Wait, but n=2 can hold two, so one spot is left. But how does that affect the energy?

Wait, no, when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, the configuration becomes:

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

So the energy is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) = 2 +4 +9=15 →15E.

So that's the first excited state.

Then, the second excited state: the next lowest energy beyond 15E would be when another particle is promoted.

Wait, but where can it go? Let's see. We could promote another n=2 particle to n=3, making:

n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2.

But wait, each n can have two. So n=3 can take two. So the configuration would have 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3.

The energy would be 2*(1) + 2*(9) =2 +18=20 →20E.

So the second excited state is 20E.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 20E. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)30E, 39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, none of them have 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the configuration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=1 particles moves up to n=3.

But that would be higher in energy than promoting from n=2, so it's not the first excited state.

Wait, let's calculate the energies again.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: perhaps 18E?

Wait, how can that be? Let me think of another configuration.

What if the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and others are in lower states?

Wait, but that would be higher in energy than promoting two to n=3.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is at n=3 and another at n=4, but that would make the total energy 2 +4 +9 +16 = but wait, we have four particles.

Wait, no, four particles: two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4. The energy would be 2E +9E +16E = 27E. That's higher than 20E, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when we have two particles in n=2 and two in n=3.

Wait, but n=2 can only hold two particles, so if both are filled, then two particles in n=3.

So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3.

Energy: 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E =20E.

So this would be higher than 15E, which is the first excited state. So the second excited state would be 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, let me look again at the options.

Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E.

How do we get 18E?

Wait, 18E would be 18 times E. Let me see what configuration gives 18E.

18E = 18 * (E) where E is the base.

So 18E = (n1^2 + n2^2 + n3^2 + n4^2) E.

But the sum of squares is 18.

Wait, possible combinations:

n1=1, n2=1, n3=2, n4=3.

Sum: 1+1+4+9=15 →15E. That's the first excited state.

Another combination: 1,1,2,2: sum is 1+1+4+4=10 →10E (ground state).

Another: 1,1,2,4: Sum is 1+1+4+16=22 →22E.

Another: 1,2,3,2: Sum is 1+4+9+4=18 →18E.

Ah, so if the configuration is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0). Wait, no, because n=2 can hold two.

Wait, maybe n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0). No, that doesn't sum to 18.

Wait, perhaps another way of distributing the particles.

Wait, perhaps the configuration is:

n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): sum is 1+1+4+9=15 →15E.

But wait, maybe in the second excited state, we have:

n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2): sum is 1+1+9+9=20 →20E.

Hmm, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, making the sum 15E, and the second excited state is when another n=2 particle moves up to n=3, making two particles in n=3, and the sum becomes 20E. But none of the options have 20E.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think about the possible orderings.

Another approach: The ground state is when all four particles are in the lowest possible states, which would be the first two energy levels filled with two each.

Then, the first excited state is when one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making the sum 15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making the sum 20E.

But again, that's not in the options. So perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps each particle's energy is (n^2) E, but the system's total energy is the sum of all four particles' energies.

So for the ground state, two particles in n=1, two in n=2: sum is 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8 =10 →10E.

For first excited state: perhaps one particle in n=3, others in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but how many particles can each n hold? Each n can hold two (spin up and down). So for four particles, possible configurations are:

Ground: 2 in 1, 2 in 2 → 10E.

First excited: 2 in 1, 1 in 2, 1 in 3 →15E.

Second excited: 2 in 1, 0 in 2, 2 in 3 → 2*(9) + 2*(1) =18 + 2=20 →20E.

But again, no option has 20E.

Wait, the options have option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, how can we get 18E?

Let me calculate 18E.

18E = (sum of squares) E = 18 E.

So sum of squares of n's is 18.

So possible n's for four particles could be:

n=1,1,2,4 → sum is 1+1+4+16=22 →22E.

No, too high.

n=1,2,2,3 → sum is 1+4+4 +9=18 →18E.

Ah! So four particles with n's 1,2,2,3.

Wait, but can two particles be in the same n? No, because each (n, spin) must be unique. So if two particles are in n=2, then their spins must be opposite. So that's allowed.

So the configuration is:

n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles), but wait, that's the ground state. That gives sum 10E.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this scenario for 18E, the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But that sums to 15E.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps the configuration is:

n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum is 1+1+4+9 =15 →15E.

But how to get 18E?

Ah! Oh wait, perhaps another configuration where two particles are in n=3, but that would be sum 2*(9) =18, but with two more particles in lower n's.

Wait, but four particles can't be all in higher n's beyond 2. So perhaps four particles are in n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4.

Wait, but that would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0): sum is 1+1+4+9 +16*0 =15.

No.

Wait, perhaps another way: two particles in n=3, and the other two in n=1. So sum is 2*(9) + 2*(1) =18 +2=20 →20E.

But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't when two particles are promoted to n=3, but when one is promoted to n=4.

So configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.

Sum: 1+1 +4 +16 =22 →22E.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would require... Wait, but n=2 can hold two, so if two are promoted, that's not possible because they can't be in the same n without same spin, which is forbidden.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=2, but that can't happen because n=1 is already filled.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D: energies are 10E,15E,18E.

So for the second excited state, 18E.

Sum of squares is 18.

So the possible n's could be 1,2,2,3 → sum is 1+4+4+9=18.

Wait, but that would mean four particles with n's 1,2,2,3.

But that's possible? Wait, n=2 can have two particles with opposite spins. So two in n=2, one in n=1, one in n=3.

Wait, but that would leave n=1 with two particles (ground state), but how does that configuration come about.

Wait, no, because in the configuration where two are in n=2 and two in n=1, that's the ground state. So that's 10E.

Wait, but in the configuration where you have two in n=2 and one in n=1 and one in n=3, that's 15E (sum 1+4+4+9=18? No, wait, no. Wait, n=1 (2 particles): sum 1+1, n=2 (two particles): sum 4+4, n=3 (1 particle): sum 9.

Wait, that adds up to 1+1 +4 +4 +9? No, but there are four particles, so total sum is 1+1 +4 +9=15.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, making the sum 15E. The second excited state is when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3. So sum is 1+1+4 +9 +9? No, four particles: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → sum 15E.

If two are promoted to n=3, then n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → sum 1*2 + 3² *2 = 2 + 18=20E.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but another is promoted to n=4, making the sum 1+1 +4 +16 =22 →22E.

But that's even higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each particle's state as just the principal quantum number n, ignoring spin. But no, the question says spin-1/2, so spin must be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are bosons, but no, spin-1/2 are fermions.

Wait, perhaps the system's total spin is considered, but I don't think that affects the energy levels unless the interaction energy is considered, which it isn't here. So we can ignore spin beyond the exclusion principle.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy levels aren't filled in the way I thought. Maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged in the next possible combination which has the next lowest energy.

Wait, for four particles, the possible filling could be:

n=1 (2), n=3 (2): sum 2*(1) + 2*(9) = 2 + 18=20E.

But that's higher than 15E, so it's a higher excited state.

The first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the sum 15E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, looking at option C: 4E, 10E, 15E.

Hmm, but why would the ground state be 4E?

Wait, that would imply that all four particles are in n=1, but that's impossible because each n can hold only two particles (due to spin). So four particles can't all be in n=1; only two can. So option C's ground state of 4E is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question states four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh, wait, perhaps the potential well isn't three-dimensional but one-dimensional, so each particle has only one quantum number (n), and spin is a separate degree of freedom.

So for each n, two particles can be placed (spin up and down), so for four particles, they fill n=1 and n=2.

So ground state: 2*(1) +2*(4) =2 +8=10 →10E.

So looking at the options, only option D has 10E as the ground state.

Then, first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3.

So particles are in n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1): sum 1+1 +4 +9=15 →15E.

Second excited state: another particle promoted to n=3. Now, n=3 has two particles, so configuration is n=1(2), n=3(2): sum 2*(1) +2*(9)=2 +18=20 →20E.

But again, option D's second excited state is 18E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the possible configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the sum 15E, and the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, which would require four particles in n=1, n=3.

Wait, no, that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, making sum 1+1+4 +16=22 →22E. But that's even higher.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to see which options make sense.

Option D says the energies are 10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

But how to get 18E.

Wait, 18E would be sum of squares 18.

So four n's: 1,1,2,4 → sum 1+1+4+16=22→22E.

No.

Or 1,2,3,2 → sum 1+4+9+4=18. Wait, that's 18.

So four particles have n=1,2,3,2.

Wait, but n=2 can have two particles, so two in n=2 (each with opposite spins), one in n=1, one in n=3.

So the configuration would be n=1 (1 particle), n=2 (2 particles), n=3 (1 particle).

Wait, but that's the same as ground state plus one particle promoted to n=3, which would be 15E.

Hmm, perhaps another way: perhaps the system's energy is (n1² + n2² +n3² +n4²) × E.

So for four particles, what's the ground state, first, and second excited states.

Ground state: 1,1,2,2 → sum 1+1+4+4=10 →10E.

First excited state:1,1,2,3 → sum 1+1+4+9=15 →15E.

Second excited state:1,2,2,3 → sum 1+4+4+9=18 →18E.

Ah! So the configuration for the second excited state is n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1). So sum is 18E.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Which matches option D.

So the correct energies would be 10E,15E,18E.

So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**:  
   For a single particle, the energy levels are quantized as \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \) is the base energy unit.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.

3. **Filling the Energy Levels**:  
   - **Ground State**:  
     The lowest energy configuration is achieved when the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. For four particles, this corresponds to two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \).  
     Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{ground}} = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E
     \]

   - **First Excited State**:  
     The next lowest energy configuration occurs when one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).  
     Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{first excited}} = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
     \]

   - **Second Excited State**:  
     The next lowest energy configuration occurs when another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), zero particles in \( n=2 \), and two particles in \( n=3 \).  
     Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{second excited}} = 2(1^2 E) + 0(2^2 E) + 2(3^2 E) = 2E + 0E + 18E = 20E
     \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated energies \( 10E, 15E, 20E \) do not match any of the provided options. However, reevaluating the configurations, an alternative interpretation suggests the second excited state corresponds to a configuration where the particles are distributed as \( n=1, 2, 2, 3 \). This gives:  
     \[
     E_{\text{second excited}} = 1^2 E + 2^2 E + 2^2 E + 3^2 E = E + 4E + 4E + 9E = 18E
     \]

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E, 15E, 18E \), respectively.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as E = π²ħ² / (2mL²), so each particle's energy levels are multiples of E based on their quantum numbers.

Wait, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. For a single particle, the energy is E_n = (n²) E, where n is the principal quantum number. So for four particles, each in their own state, their energies add up.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. Oh, right, but in a 1D well, each particle has quantum numbers based on their position (n) and spin (up or down). So each energy level can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Wait, so each n level can have 2 particles. So for four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels?

Ground state would be the lowest possible energy, so the first few n's filled up as much as possible. Let's think about the possible states.

Each energy level E_n can hold 2 particles because of spin. So the first level (n=1) can have 2, second (n=2) can have 2, and so on.

So with four particles:

- n=1: 2 particles (each with opposite spins)
- n=2: 2 particles

Wait, that would be four particles total. So the first two energy levels are completely filled.

Wait, but what about the ordering when multiple particles are in higher states?

Wait, but for the system of particles, the total energy is the sum of each individual's energy. So ground state is when as many as possible are in the lowest energy states.

So for four particles, each can take a state with n=1 and n=2, with each n holding two particles.

So the particles would be arranged as two in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but that's the total for the ground state? So ground state energy is 10E?

Wait, but wait. No, wait. Each particle's energy is (n²) E. So two particles in n=1 each contribute E, so 2E. Two in n=2 contribute 4E each: 8E. So total is 2E +8E =10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but the question is about the energies of the system's states, not each particle. So the ground state energy is 10E.

But wait, the options don't have 10E as the first option. Hmm, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E, 15E,18E.

Wait, but the question says "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because for four particles, the ground state isn't 10E. Let me think again.

Wait, wait. Each particle can be in a state with quantum number n, and each n can have two spins. So for four particles, the lowest possible configuration is two in n=1 (each with opposite spins), two in n=2.

So total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

But wait, I think I might be mixing up the way the particles are filled. Because for identical fermions, each must have a unique quantum state. So maybe for four particles, they have to occupy different states, but since each energy level can hold two, perhaps the filling is different.

Wait, maybe I should model it as each particle having a unique combination of n and spin. So for four particles, each must have a unique (n, spin) pair.

So the first two particles go into n=1 with opposite spins. The next two can't go into n=1 because the spins are filled, so they go into n=2 with opposite spins.

So yeah, that gives the same as before: 2 particles in n=1 and 2 in n=2.

So ground state energy is 10E. So looking at the options, option D has 10E as first energy, but the first excited state. Wait, no, in the options, the first number is ground state.

Wait, no, the options are the energies for ground, first excited, and second excited. So if ground is 10E, I don't see that as the first option.

Wait, options:

Option B: 4E, 10E, 50E

Hmm, but that would mean ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, which would suggest that the particles are in a lower configuration.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Wait, four identical spin-1/2 fermions in the well. The lowest possible energy is when they occupy the lowest possible n's with their spins.

So the first two particles (n=1, spin up and down) make two particles. The next two can't go into n=1 because spins are filled, so they go into n=2.

Wait, so the total energy is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state is 10E.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake because in the ground state, perhaps the particles are arranged in a different way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the particles are arranged with their quantum numbers as (n, spin) but in the lowest possible way. So maybe for four particles, each must have a unique n and spin combination.

Ah, wait, no. Because each n can have two particles (spin up and spin down). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two into n=2.

So the ground state energy is 10E.

So looking at the options, option D has ground state as 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E. But I need to see what the first and second excited states would be.

Wait, the next possible state would be when the particles have a higher arrangement. So the first excited state would be when the particles are in the next possible arrangement where one particle's n is increased.

How do the energy levels work when they're not all in the lowest possible n's?

So the ground state is 10E: two in n=1, two in n=2.

The first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to a higher n. But which combination gives the next lowest energy.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3, but wait, that would require more energy.

Wait, but let's think about the possible ways to arrange four particles in the well, beyond the ground state.

Another approach: For four fermions, each must have a unique (n, spin) state.

Wait, perhaps the filling is as follows:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down)

n=2: two particles (spin up and down)

But that's the ground state.

Wait, but how do you get the first excited state? Maybe you promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So then the configuration would be n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (1 particle), n=3 (1 particle).

Wait, but wait, each n can hold two particles. So if in first excited state, you have one n=3 particle, but then you could have another.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state would have the four particles as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Wait, but that would mean the next state up.

Wait, let me think. The total energy for this configuration would be 2*E_1 + 1*E_2 + 1*E_3 = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, so that's 15E.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the first excited state has a different configuration where higher states are filled in a way that the total energy is lower than 15E.

Alternatively, what if one of the particles moves from n=2 to n=3, but another moves from n=2 to n=2 (no, that's not possible because spin is already filled). Or perhaps another way.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state has three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. But that can't be because n=1 can only hold two particles (since they're spin-1/2), so three can't fit. So that's impossible.

Hmm. So perhaps the next possible state after the ground state (10E) is 15E.

Wait, but let me think of the possible energy levels when particles are promoted beyond n=2.

Wait, each particle must have a unique (n, spin). So for four particles, the ground state is all in n=1 and 2.

Now, the first excited state would be when the configuration is n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1). So total energy is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) )= 2 +4 +9 =15 →15E.

Wait, but then the second excited state would be when another particle is promoted. Maybe to n=3 or n=4.

Wait, but let me think. For the second excited state, what's the next possible higher energy.

Another configuration could be n=1(2), n=2(0), n=3(2), but wait, n=2 can hold two, so if all four are in n=3, but no—because two are spin up and down.

Wait, no, four particles can't all be in the same n because each n can hold two. So the next possible step is to have two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3 (as before), but perhaps another configuration.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3. So two in n=3, but each with different spins.

Wait, let me think: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3.

So the energy would be 2*(1) + 2*(9) = 2 +18=20 →20E.

That's higher than 15E, so maybe that's the second excited state.

But wait, what's the order of states? So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E. But looking at the options, option D has second excited as 18E. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and the other n=2 particle moves to n=2. No, that doesn't make sense because each n can hold two.

Wait, maybe I should consider the order in which the particles are filled. Let me think about the energy levels in terms of possible states.

Each particle must have a unique (n, spin) state.

So the ground state is:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down)

n=2: two particles (spin up and down)

Total energy = 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8=10 →10E.

Now, the first excited state: the lowest energy possible higher than 10E, which would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to a higher n.

Wait, but that would require the next possible n, which is 3.

So in the first excited state, we have:

n=1: 2

n=2:1 (since one particle was promoted to n=3)

n=3:1 (the promoted particle)

Wait, but n=2 can hold two, so one spot is left. But how does that affect the energy?

Wait, no, when a particle is promoted from n=2 to n=3, the configuration becomes:

n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

So the energy is 2*(1) +1*(4) +1*(9) = 2 +4 +9=15 →15E.

So that's the first excited state.

Then, the second excited state: the next lowest energy beyond 15E would be when another particle is promoted.

Wait, but where can it go? Let's see. We could promote another n=2 particle to n=3, making:

n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2.

But wait, each n can have two. So n=3 can take two. So the configuration would have 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, and 2 in n=3.

The energy would be 2*(1) + 2*(9) =2 +18=20 →20E.

So the second excited state is 20E.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 20E. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)30E, 39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, none of them have 20E. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the configuration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=1 particles moves up to n=3.

But that would be higher in energy than promoting from n=2, so it's not the first excited state.

Wait, let's calculate the energies again.

Ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

Second excited: perhaps 18E?

Wait, how can that be? Let me think of another configuration.

What if the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4 and others are in lower states?

Wait, but that would be higher in energy than promoting two to n=3.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is at n=3 and another at n=4, but that would make the total energy 2 +4 +9 +16 = but wait, we have four particles.

Wait, no, four particles: two in n=1, one in n=3, one in n=4. The energy would be 2E +9E +16E = 27E. That's higher than 20E, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when we have two particles in n=2 and two in n=3.

Wait, but n=2 can only hold two particles, so if both are filled, then two particles in n=3.

So the configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3.

Energy: 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E =20E.

So this would be higher than 15E, which is the first excited state. So the second excited state would be 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, let me look again at the options.

Option D is 10E, 15E, 18E.

How do we get 18E?

Wait, 18E would be 18 times E. Let me see what configuration gives 18E.

18E = 18 * (E) where E is the base.

So 18E = (n1^2 + n2^2 + n3^2 + n4^2) E.

But the sum of squares is 18.

Wait, possible combinations:

n1=1, n2=1, n3=2, n4=3.

Sum: 1+1+4+9=15 →15E. That's the first excited state.

Another combination: 1,1,2,2: sum is 1+1+4+4=10 →10E (ground state).

Another: 1,1,2,4: Sum is 1+1+4+16=22 →22E.

Another: 1,2,3,2: Sum is 1+4+9+4=18 →18E.

Ah, so if the configuration is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0). Wait, no, because n=2 can hold two.

Wait, maybe n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0). No, that doesn't sum to 18.

Wait, perhaps another way of distributing the particles.

Wait, perhaps the configuration is:

n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): sum is 1+1+4+9=15 →15E.

But wait, maybe in the second excited state, we have:

n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2): sum is 1+1+9+9=20 →20E.

Hmm, but that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves up to n=3, making the sum 15E, and the second excited state is when another n=2 particle moves up to n=3, making two particles in n=3, and the sum becomes 20E. But none of the options have 20E.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think about the possible orderings.

Another approach: The ground state is when all four particles are in the lowest possible states, which would be the first two energy levels filled with two each.

Then, the first excited state is when one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making the sum 15E.

The second excited state would be when another particle from n=2 moves to n=3, making the sum 20E.

But again, that's not in the options. So perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps each particle's energy is (n^2) E, but the system's total energy is the sum of all four particles' energies.

So for the ground state, two particles in n=1, two in n=2: sum is 2*(1) + 2*(4) = 2 +8 =10 →10E.

For first excited state: perhaps one particle in n=3, others in n=1 and n=2.

Wait, but how many particles can each n hold? Each n can hold two (spin up and down). So for four particles, possible configurations are:

Ground: 2 in 1, 2 in 2 → 10E.

First excited: 2 in 1, 1 in 2, 1 in 3 →15E.

Second excited: 2 in 1, 0 in 2, 2 in 3 → 2*(9) + 2*(1) =18 + 2=20 →20E.

But again, no option has 20E.

Wait, the options have option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, how can we get 18E?

Let me calculate 18E.

18E = (sum of squares) E = 18 E.

So sum of squares of n's is 18.

So possible n's for four particles could be:

n=1,1,2,4 → sum is 1+1+4+16=22 →22E.

No, too high.

n=1,2,2,3 → sum is 1+4+4 +9=18 →18E.

Ah! So four particles with n's 1,2,2,3.

Wait, but can two particles be in the same n? No, because each (n, spin) must be unique. So if two particles are in n=2, then their spins must be opposite. So that's allowed.

So the configuration is:

n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles), but wait, that's the ground state. That gives sum 10E.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this scenario for 18E, the configuration would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But that sums to 15E.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps the configuration is:

n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum is 1+1+4+9 =15 →15E.

But how to get 18E?

Ah! Oh wait, perhaps another configuration where two particles are in n=3, but that would be sum 2*(9) =18, but with two more particles in lower n's.

Wait, but four particles can't be all in higher n's beyond 2. So perhaps four particles are in n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4.

Wait, but that would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), n=4 (0): sum is 1+1+4+9 +16*0 =15.

No.

Wait, perhaps another way: two particles in n=3, and the other two in n=1. So sum is 2*(9) + 2*(1) =18 +2=20 →20E.

But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state isn't when two particles are promoted to n=3, but when one is promoted to n=4.

So configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4.

Sum: 1+1 +4 +16 =22 →22E.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are promoted from n=2 to n=3, but that would require... Wait, but n=2 can hold two, so if two are promoted, that's not possible because they can't be in the same n without same spin, which is forbidden.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted from n=1 to n=2, but that can't happen because n=1 is already filled.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option D: energies are 10E,15E,18E.

So for the second excited state, 18E.

Sum of squares is 18.

So the possible n's could be 1,2,2,3 → sum is 1+4+4+9=18.

Wait, but that would mean four particles with n's 1,2,2,3.

But that's possible? Wait, n=2 can have two particles with opposite spins. So two in n=2, one in n=1, one in n=3.

Wait, but that would leave n=1 with two particles (ground state), but how does that configuration come about.

Wait, no, because in the configuration where two are in n=2 and two in n=1, that's the ground state. So that's 10E.

Wait, but in the configuration where you have two in n=2 and one in n=1 and one in n=3, that's 15E (sum 1+4+4+9=18? No, wait, no. Wait, n=1 (2 particles): sum 1+1, n=2 (two particles): sum 4+4, n=3 (1 particle): sum 9.

Wait, that adds up to 1+1 +4 +4 +9? No, but there are four particles, so total sum is 1+1 +4 +9=15.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3, making the sum 15E. The second excited state is when another particle is promoted to n=3, making two in n=3. So sum is 1+1+4 +9 +9? No, four particles: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1) → sum 15E.

If two are promoted to n=3, then n=1 (2), n=3 (2) → sum 1*2 + 3² *2 = 2 + 18=20E.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but another is promoted to n=4, making the sum 1+1 +4 +16 =22 →22E.

But that's even higher.

Hmm. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each particle's state as just the principal quantum number n, ignoring spin. But no, the question says spin-1/2, so spin must be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are bosons, but no, spin-1/2 are fermions.

Wait, perhaps the system's total spin is considered, but I don't think that affects the energy levels unless the interaction energy is considered, which it isn't here. So we can ignore spin beyond the exclusion principle.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the energy levels aren't filled in the way I thought. Maybe the first excited state is when the particles are arranged in the next possible combination which has the next lowest energy.

Wait, for four particles, the possible filling could be:

n=1 (2), n=3 (2): sum 2*(1) + 2*(9) = 2 + 18=20E.

But that's higher than 15E, so it's a higher excited state.

The first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the sum 15E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, looking at option C: 4E, 10E, 15E.

Hmm, but why would the ground state be 4E?

Wait, that would imply that all four particles are in n=1, but that's impossible because each n can hold only two particles (due to spin). So four particles can't all be in n=1; only two can. So option C's ground state of 4E is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The question states four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh, wait, perhaps the potential well isn't three-dimensional but one-dimensional, so each particle has only one quantum number (n), and spin is a separate degree of freedom.

So for each n, two particles can be placed (spin up and down), so for four particles, they fill n=1 and n=2.

So ground state: 2*(1) +2*(4) =2 +8=10 →10E.

So looking at the options, only option D has 10E as the ground state.

Then, first excited state would be when one particle is promoted to n=3.

So particles are in n=1(2), n=2(1), n=3(1): sum 1+1 +4 +9=15 →15E.

Second excited state: another particle promoted to n=3. Now, n=3 has two particles, so configuration is n=1(2), n=3(2): sum 2*(1) +2*(9)=2 +18=20 →20E.

But again, option D's second excited state is 18E.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something about the possible configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the sum 15E, and the second excited state is when two particles are promoted to n=3, which would require four particles in n=1, n=3.

Wait, no, that's not possible because n=1 can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=4, making sum 1+1+4 +16=22 →22E. But that's even higher.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to see which options make sense.

Option D says the energies are 10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

But how to get 18E.

Wait, 18E would be sum of squares 18.

So four n's: 1,1,2,4 → sum 1+1+4+16=22→22E.

No.

Or 1,2,3,2 → sum 1+4+9+4=18. Wait, that's 18.

So four particles have n=1,2,3,2.

Wait, but n=2 can have two particles, so two in n=2 (each with opposite spins), one in n=1, one in n=3.

So the configuration would be n=1 (1 particle), n=2 (2 particles), n=3 (1 particle).

Wait, but that's the same as ground state plus one particle promoted to n=3, which would be 15E.

Hmm, perhaps another way: perhaps the system's energy is (n1² + n2² +n3² +n4²) × E.

So for four particles, what's the ground state, first, and second excited states.

Ground state: 1,1,2,2 → sum 1+1+4+4=10 →10E.

First excited state:1,1,2,3 → sum 1+1+4+9=15 →15E.

Second excited state:1,2,2,3 → sum 1+4+4+9=18 →18E.

Ah! So the configuration for the second excited state is n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1). So sum is 18E.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 18E.

Which matches option D.

So the correct energies would be 10E,15E,18E.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Key Points:
1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**:  
   For a single particle, the energy levels are quantized as \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \) is the base energy unit.

2. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**:  
   Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. Each energy level \( n \) can hold two particles, one with spin-up and one with spin-down.

3. **Filling the Energy Levels**:  
   - **Ground State**:  
     The lowest energy configuration is achieved when the particles fill the lowest available energy levels. For four particles, this corresponds to two particles in \( n=1 \) and two particles in \( n=2 \).  
     Total energy:

     E_{\text{ground}} = 2(1^2 E) + 2(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E = 10E
     \]

   - **First Excited State**:  
     The next lowest energy configuration occurs when one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), one particle in \( n=2 \), and one particle in \( n=3 \).  
     Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{first excited}} = 2(1^2 E) + 1(2^2 E) + 1(3^2 E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
     \]

   - **Second Excited State**:  
     The next lowest energy configuration occurs when another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes two particles in \( n=1 \), zero particles in \( n=2 \), and two particles in \( n=3 \).  
     Total energy:  
     \[
     E_{\text{second excited}} = 2(1^2 E) + 0(2^2 E) + 2(3^2 E) = 2E + 0E + 18E = 20E
     \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   The calculated energies \( 10E, 15E, 20E \) do not match any of the provided options. However, reevaluating the configurations, an alternative interpretation suggests the second excited state corresponds to a configuration where the particles are distributed as \( n=1, 2, 2, 3 \). This gives:  
     \[
     E_{\text{second excited}} = 1^2 E + 2^2 E + 2^2 E + 3^2 E = E + 4E + 4E + 9E = 18E
     \]

Thus, the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state are \( 10E, 15E, 18E \), respectively.
