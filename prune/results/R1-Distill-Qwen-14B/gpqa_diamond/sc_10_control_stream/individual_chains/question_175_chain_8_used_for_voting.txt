Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and the radiation they produce. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says that there's an oscillating charge distribution in the shape of a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it should radiate at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees, along with the possible form of f.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation, and this radiation patterns depend on the angle. The radiation is not isotropic, meaning it's not the same in all directions. For a dipole radiator, for example, the radiation pattern is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis, which in this case is the z-axis.

Oh, right! The dipole radiation pattern has a specific angular dependence. I think the intensity of the radiation (which is power per unit area) in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to (1/(r²)) multiplied by sin²θ or something like that. Or wait, maybe the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity multiplied by the area, so maybe it's just proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, no, let's think again. The power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for a dipole is given by I think I remember that for a dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to (sin²θ) times a constant that includes the frequency and the dipole moment. So the function f(λ, θ) would have a sin²θ dependence.

But wait, the problem is about the fraction of the maximum power A. The maximum power occurs when the intensity is at its peak. Let's think about the maximum of sin²θ. The maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, so sin²θ is 1. So the maximum intensity is when θ is 90 degrees.

But the question is about θ=30 degrees. So the fraction would be [sin²(30)] divided by [maximum sin²θ]. Since the maximum is 1, the fraction is just sin²(30).

Wait, sin(30) is 0.5, so sin² is 0.25. So the fraction is 1/4. So the fraction of A that's radiated at 30 degrees is 1/4. That would be 25% of A.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one has 1/4 as the first part. Options B and C have 1/4 as the first part.

Now, what about the form of f? The function f depends on λ. For an oscillating dipole, the radiated power depends on the frequency, which is related to λ.

Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to the square of the acceleration, but in the far field, the fields depend on 1/r. The power radiated is proportional to the square of the field. So the intensity (power per unit solid angle) would be proportional to (sin²θ) times (1/λ^4), because the field strength for an oscillating dipole is inversely proportional to λ^2 (since c = fλ, so λ is proportional to 1/f, and the field is proportional to 1/f², which is λ^2). Then, the intensity, which is the square of the field times other factors, would be proportional to (1/λ^4) times sin²θ. So f would be proportional to sin²θ multiplied by λ^-4.

Looking at the options, option C says the fraction is 1/4 and f is λ^-4. That matches, I think.

Wait, but wait another thought: the intensity for a dipole is actually proportional to (λ^−4) sin²θ. So the function f would be proportional to λ^−4 * sin²θ.

So the function f is proportional to λ^-4, and the fraction at 30 degrees is 1/4. So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution in the shape of a spheroid, with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. The radiation pattern depends on the angle θ (measured from the z-axis) and the wavelength λ. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), which describes the radiated power per unit solid angle.

For a dipole radiator, the radiation intensity is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \). Therefore, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

The function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) depends on the radiation properties of the oscillating charge distribution. For a dipole, the radiated power is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \), as the field strength decreases with \( \lambda^2 \), and the intensity, being proportional to the square of the field, decreases with \( \lambda^{-4} \). Thus, \( f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \lambda^{-4} \sin^2\theta \).

Among the options, the one that matches the fraction \( 1/4 \) and the form \( \lambda^{-4} \) is **Option C**.
