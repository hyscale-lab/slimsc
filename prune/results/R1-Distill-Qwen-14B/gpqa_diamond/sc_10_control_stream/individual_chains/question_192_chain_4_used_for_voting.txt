Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric fields and conductors. I remember conductors have some properties when it comes to electric fields, especially when they're charged or uncharged.

The problem says we have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. So the cavity is off-center. Got it.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l, L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. Oh, I think that's the angle between the vector pointing from the conductor's center to P and the one pointing from the conductor's center to the cavity's center.

Wait, so the conductor was initially uncharged. When we put a charge inside the cavity, what happens? I remember that in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charges reside on the surface. But if the conductor was neutral initially, and now there's a charge inside the cavity, how does that affect the charges in the conductor?

Oh right, when a charge is placed inside the cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the charge is positive, it induces a negative charge on the cavity's inner surface. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so the total charge on the outer surface must balance it. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged before the charge is placed. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, it will induce -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q, because the inner is -q. So the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the inner surface has -q, and the outer +q. Because the sum is zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0.

But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the net charge is zero. So yes, the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface gets +q. So when we're outside the conductor, the electric field should be due to the charge on the outer surface. But wait, the charge on the outer surface is distributed how? Well, in a spherical shell, the charge would arrange itself uniformly, but in this case, the cavity is off-center.

Wait, but the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the presence of the inner charge. But for the field outside, does the distribution matter? Because for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is as if all the charge is concentrated at the center. But in this case, the outer surface is a sphere, so regardless of the inner charge's position, the outer charge would still produce a field as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor. Right?

Wait, is that correct? Because the outer surface might not be a perfect sphere. Wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere regardless. So the charge distribution on the outer surface of a conducting sphere would be uniform, because the sphere is symmetric, right? But wait, the presence of the inner charge (even if off-center) affects the inner surface's charge distribution but not the outer. Or does it?

Wait, no. The inner charge induces a charge distribution on the inner surface, which is non-uniform if the inner charge is off-center. But the conductor's outer surface, being a separate shell, would still have a uniform distribution because the conductor is neutral overall. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the conductor is a conductor, so it has free electrons. The +q inside the cavity will attract electrons to the inner surface, making it negative (-q), and the remaining conductor (the outer part) will have a charge of +q to balance, because the conductor was initially neutral. So the outer surface is +q, but how is it distributed? Since the conductor is a sphere, the outer charge should arrange uniformly, regardless of where the inner charge is. Because the conductor is a sphere, it's symmetric, so the outer charge distribution is uniform.

If that's the case, then the electric field outside would be as if all the charge is at the center, so the field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_outer)/L². Because for a point outside a sphere, the field is as if the charge is at the center, and the distance is L.

So the outer charge is Q_outer = +q. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). So looking at the options, option B is that.

But wait, let me think again. Because the point P is not just any point; its distance from the cavity's center is l, and it's at an angle theta relative to s. Does that affect anything?

Wait, the electric field is due to the outer charge, which is on the conductor's outer surface. Since the conductor is a sphere, the outer charge's distribution is uniform. So the field outside is the same as if the charge were at the center. So the position of the cavity's charge (i.e., the point where +q is placed in the cavity) doesn't affect the outer field, because the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform.

So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer surface has uniform +q, so the field outside is simply (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me consider another angle. The cavity's position is off-center. So the field inside the conductor would be different, but outside, it's the same as a point charge at the center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing something. Maybe the point P is affected by the position of the cavity's charge. But no, because the outer surface's field depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center. Because the conductor is a sphere, the field outside is spherically symmetric, so it doesn't depend on where the inner charge is located.

So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induction**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge of $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must develop a charge of $+q$ to balance the net charge.

2. **Distribution of Charges**: The outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell. For a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface distribute uniformly, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. This is a consequence of the conductor's symmetry.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a spherical shell of charge is given by Coulomb's law, as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Thus, the electric field at a point $P$ outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface ($+q$) and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to $P$.

4. **Irrelevance of Cavity's Position**: The position of the cavity (and the charge inside it) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field outside is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center. The angle $\theta$ and the distance $l$ from the cavity's center to $P$ are irrelevant in this context.

5. **Final Expression**: Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

6. **Analysis of Options**: Among the given options, only option **B** matches this result.
