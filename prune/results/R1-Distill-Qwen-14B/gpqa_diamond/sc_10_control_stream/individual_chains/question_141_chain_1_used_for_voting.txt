Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out how many possible products form when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think through this.

Wait, first, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, I think that's bromobenzene with a deuterium substitution. Like, the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium adjacent to the bromine.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In aromatic chemistry, what kind of reactions occur with NaNH2 and aromatic rings?

Oh, right! Friedel-Crafts reactions are about alkylation or acylation, but that's with AlCl3 as a catalyst. Wait, no, this is a different setup. Oh, wait, when aromatic rings are dehalogenated under certain conditions. Or maybe it's about elimination.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In some cases, it can cause elimination reactions. But in aromatic substitution, like when you have a directing group.

Wait, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the bromine is at position 1, and deuterium at position 2. So, when treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, perhaps it's going to cause a dehydrohalogenation? Or maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution?

Wait, no. Wait, I remember that with alkyl halides, NaNH2 can abstract a proton to form an alkoxide, leading to elimination (like forming alkenes via E2). But in aromatic systems, maybe it's about elimination of the halide.

Wait, another thought: benzene with a halogen adjacent to a deuterium. So when the base abstracts a proton (deuterium?), perhaps the leaving group (bromide) can leave, forming a new ring structure.

Wait, but wait, benzene rings are pretty stable. Removing a halide adjacent to another substituent could lead to ring contraction or expansion? No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's elimination of HBr, but wait, the bromine is attached to the ring. Oh, wait, maybe the bromide is leaving as Br-, and the ring undergoes some sort of elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the base could abstract a hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine. Let's imagine the structure: the bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. So, if the base takes a proton (but wait, it's a deuterium there), but wait, the deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, so maybe it's less reactive. Hmm, but the base is strong enough to abstract it? Or perhaps not. Maybe the base abstracts a proton from the ring that's not the deuterium.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible reactions of bromobenzene with a strong base like NaNH2. I think NaNH2 is used in the synthesis of benzynes. Oh, right! Benzynes are formed when a dihalobenzene undergoes dehalogenation, but wait, in that case, you have two halogens across the ring. But in this case, we have only one bromine and a deuterium.

Wait, so benzene with Br and D adjacent. If I eliminate HBr, but wait, the D is in position 2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen (not the D) from position 3, for example, then the Br would leave, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2? Or maybe a double bond?

Wait, let's think about the mechanism. If the base (NH2-) abstracts a hydrogen atom from a carbon adjacent to the bromine, that would create a carbanion adjacent to the Br. Then, the bromide would leave, forming a triple bond between the two carbons. Oh, wait, that's how benzynes are formed, typically from o-dihalobenzenes. So in the case of o-dibromobenzene, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a triple bond (benzyne).

But wait, in our case, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So only one Br and one D. Can this molecule form a benzyne-like structure upon treatment with NaNH2?

Hmm. So in our case, the structure is Br at position 1 and D at position 2. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 (meta to D?), but wait, the positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), so the adjacent positions are 2 (deutero) and 4 (ortho to Br and meta to D).

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to the D and adjacent to the Br. So, the base abstracts H from position 3, leading to a negative charge at position 3, but wait, the Br is at position 1.

Wait, perhaps another approach. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, which is para to the Br and adjacent to position 3, which is ortho to the D. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 2, but wait, that's the position with the deuterium. But deuterium is heavier than hydrogen, but the base is strong enough. Or maybe the base can't abstract D because it's a primary isotope effect. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is ortho to Br and meta to the D.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a single elimination. So when the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to bromine, the bromide leaves, forming a triple bond between the adjacent carbons. But in this case, do we have adjacent substituents?

Wait, 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene would have Br at position 1 and D at position 2. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, then the adjacent carbons are 2 and 3. But wait, position 2 has a D, not a hydrogen. So position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (D at 2, H at 3? No, wait, in benzene, position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4, but not 1.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out mentally. Benzene ring. Position 1: Br. Position 2: D. So positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to position 2, but position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and position 4. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, which is para to the Br and adjacent to position 3. So if the base abstracts H from position 4, then the Br would leave, and form a triple bond between C1 and C4? No, that can't be. Because the positions are 1 and 4, which are across the ring. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so 1 and 4 are across from each other, which would make a triple bond, but that's not feasible because benzene is a six-membered ring, and forming a triple bond across would require a four-membered ring, which isn't possible. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (deuterium), but position 3 is also adjacent to position 4. Hmm, but position 3 is meta to the Br, which is at position 1. Alternatively, perhaps it abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is ortho to Br and adjacent to position 5.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the possibility of elimination. The base (NH2-) can abstract a hydrogen from a position adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a triple bond between the adjacent carbons, releasing HBr.

But wait, in this case, the only possible adjacent positions to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has a D, not a H. So, the base can abstract a H from position 6. So position 6 is adjacent to Br (position 1), and the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between C1 and C6? But wait, C1 and C6 are adjacent? Yes, because in benzene, each position is connected to the next. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3, etc., 6 and 1. So C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6.

So, if the base abstracts H from C6, then C1 and C6 would each lose a substituent (Br from C1, H from C6), forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, the ring would then have a triple bond between C1 and C6, which would make the ring a triple bond, but that's impossible in a six-membered ring because triple bonds can't form in a six-membered ring without ring strain.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again. Benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. If we eliminate Br and H from adjacent positions, the ring would form a triple bond there. But that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a diradical or a different structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up things. Benzene rings typically can't form triple bonds between adjacent carbons because that would require a four-membered ring or a smaller structure, which isn't feasible. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed that way.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the deuterium affects the reaction. Since deuterium is a heavier isotope, maybe it's less likely to be abstracted. So the base will abstract a hydrogen from another position, but in this molecule, the only adjacent position to Br that has a hydrogen is position 6 (if position 2 has a D, then position 6 is adjacent to Br and has an H).

So, when NaNH2 is added, it abstracts H from position 6. Then, the Br leaves as Br-, and the adjacent carbons (C1 and C6) lose H and Br, forming a triple bond between them. But since the benzene ring is six-membered, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6 would make a five-membered ring? No, wait, that's not possible. So, perhaps the ring would open up? Or maybe the structure rearranges.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond, but in a six-membered ring, that's not possible. So maybe this reaction isn't feasible, and no product forms. But that can't be, because the question says it's treated with NaNH2, so there must be a reaction.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possibility of elimination. If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D), and then the Br leaves, but position 3 is not adjacent to Br. So that wouldn't lead to a triple bond between Br and H.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to the Br. Then, Br would leave, but that leaves a ring with a triple bond between position 1 and 4, which is three carbons apart. That doesn't make sense because a triple bond can't be that long.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't about elimination but substitution. Could the NH2- act as a nucleophile? But in aromatic substitution, nucleophilic attack is not common unless the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, but I'm not sure if it's enough for nucleophilic aromatic substitution without a strong activating group.

Wait, but in this case, the ring has a Br and a D. So if the NH2- attacks the ring, perhaps at the position para to Br. But that's just a guess, and I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond. But earlier I thought that's not possible.

Wait, another thought. Benzene rings can undergo elimination to form a diene if two adjacent substituents are present. But in this case, we have only one substituent (Br) and a D, which is not a leaving group.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a similar reaction. Oh, right! When you have a benzene ring with two halogens adjacent to each other (like o-dihalobenzene), treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 can lead to the elimination of both halogens, forming a triple bond (benzyne intermediate). But in our case, it's only a Br and a D adjacent. So, can the same thing happen?

Wait, but D isn't a leaving group. So, the base can abstract a hydrogen from the adjacent position, but with a D in position 2, maybe the base can't abstract it. So, perhaps the only available H is in position 6 (ortho to Br), which is adjacent to position 1. So the base would abstract H from position 6, Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6. But wait, in a six-membered ring, that's adjacent, so the ring would have a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, which would make it a triple bond in the ring, creating a triple bond, but that's not possible in a six-membered ring. Wait, but benzene can't have a triple bond because that would require a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the ring would undergo some structural change. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the question implies a product.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: How many products can form? The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction forms only one product, then the answer is B) 1. If it forms two, then C) 2.

Wait, but what if the deuterium affects the reaction in such a way that two different products form? Because the molecule can lose H from position 6, leading to a triple bond, but maybe the deuterium in position 2 could lead to a different outcome. Or maybe the reaction can't proceed, but the question says it's treated with NaNH2, so it must do something.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate but instead leads to a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is meta to Br and adjacent to D. But that's not adjacent to Br; it's meta. So elimination wouldn't happen from there.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the base can't abstract the D, so the only possible elimination is from position 6. So the product would be a ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, but that's a six-membered ring, which can't accommodate a triple bond. So perhaps the ring breaks, but I don't think that's a common pathway.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material. But the question says it's treated with NaNH2, implying a reaction occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, leading to a different elimination. So if the base abstracts H from position 4, which is para to Br, then Br would leave, but that's not adjacent. So that wouldn't form a triple bond.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I need to think about the possible products. If the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, and it undergoes elimination by losing HBr, the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that's adjacent, so the ring would have a triple bond between those two, which would be a five-membered ring? No, that can't be. So perhaps the reaction can't proceed, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the deuterium is a problem. If the base can't abstract the D, then the only H available for elimination is from position 6. So the reaction forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, but that would require the ring to have a triple bond, which isn't possible in a six-membered ring. Therefore, the reaction can't proceed, and no products form. But the question says it's treated with NaNH2, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution. The NH2- acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzene ring. But bromobenzene isn't very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution unless there's a strong activating group. But wait, the ring is deactivated by the Br, making nucleophilic substitution difficult. So perhaps that's not the pathway.

Wait, but sometimes, in the presence of strong bases, elimination can occur. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium in position 2 and a hydrogen in position 6 being abstracted, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a triple bond. But the ring can't have a triple bond, so perhaps the reaction doesn't happen. Or perhaps the ring opens, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction, and the base abstracts a H from position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a triple bond, and thus a benzyne intermediate. But then, the ring would have a triple bond, which is a very reactive species.

Wait, but if the triple bond is formed between C1 and C6, that would be a six-membered ring with a triple bond between adjacent carbons. But that's impossible because benzene rings can't have triple bonds in such positions without breaking the ring. So maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question must have a solution.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products. If the reaction leads to one product, the answer is B) 1. If two, then C) 2.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is causing the molecule to lose HBr, but due to the position of D, the base can abstract H from two different positions, leading to two different products. But I can't see how.

Alternatively, maybe the base can abstract H from either position 6 or position 4, leading to two different elimination products. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, position 6 is adjacent to Br, so elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, but that's adjacent. Position 4 is para to Br, so abstracting H from position 4 would not be adjacent, so elimination wouldn't form a triple bond. So perhaps only one elimination site is possible.

Wait, maybe the base can abstract H from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D) but not Br. So elimination would form a triple bond between 2 and 3, but position 2 has a D, which isn't a leaving group. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate but leads to a substitution. If the NH2- attacks the ring, perhaps at the para position to Br, but I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the reaction leads to only one product. So the answer is B) 1.

Wait, but the deuterium is at position 2. Since D and H are different, maybe the reaction leads to different products based on which H is abstracted. Wait, but in this case, only position 6 has a H adjacent to Br. So the base can only abstract from position 6, leading to one product. So the answer is B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions. In this case, the base can abstract a hydrogen atom from a position adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between the two carbons involved in the elimination.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. The only position adjacent to the bromine that has a hydrogen atom (rather than a deuterium) is position 6. The base (NH₂⁻) can abstract the hydrogen from position 6, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a single product, as the reaction pathway is specific and only one elimination site is possible.

The deuterium at position 2 does not interfere with the reaction because the base cannot abstract deuterium effectively, and the elimination occurs exclusively at position 6. Therefore, only one product is formed in this reaction.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out how many possible products form when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but let me think through this.

Wait, first, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, I think that's bromobenzene with a deuterium substitution. Like, the benzene ring has a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium adjacent to the bromine.

Now, the reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In aromatic chemistry, what kind of reactions occur with NaNH2 and aromatic rings?

Oh, right! Friedel-Crafts reactions are about alkylation or acylation, but that's with AlCl3 as a catalyst. Wait, no, this is a different setup. Oh, wait, when aromatic rings are dehalogenated under certain conditions. Or maybe it's about elimination.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. NaNH2 is a strong base and a good nucleophile. In some cases, it can cause elimination reactions. But in aromatic substitution, like when you have a directing group.

Wait, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the bromine is at position 1, and deuterium at position 2. So, when treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, which is a strong base, perhaps it's going to cause a dehydrohalogenation? Or maybe it's a nucleophilic aromatic substitution?

Wait, no. Wait, I remember that with alkyl halides, NaNH2 can abstract a proton to form an alkoxide, leading to elimination (like forming alkenes via E2). But in aromatic systems, maybe it's about elimination of the halide.

Wait, another thought: benzene with a halogen adjacent to a deuterium. So when the base abstracts a proton (deuterium?), perhaps the leaving group (bromide) can leave, forming a new ring structure.

Wait, but wait, benzene rings are pretty stable. Removing a halide adjacent to another substituent could lead to ring contraction or expansion? No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's elimination of HBr, but wait, the bromine is attached to the ring. Oh, wait, maybe the bromide is leaving as Br-, and the ring undergoes some sort of elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the base could abstract a hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent to the bromine. Let's imagine the structure: the bromine is at position 1, and deuterium is at position 2. So, if the base takes a proton (but wait, it's a deuterium there), but wait, the deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, so maybe it's less reactive. Hmm, but the base is strong enough to abstract it? Or perhaps not. Maybe the base abstracts a proton from the ring that's not the deuterium.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible reactions of bromobenzene with a strong base like NaNH2. I think NaNH2 is used in the synthesis of benzynes. Oh, right! Benzynes are formed when a dihalobenzene undergoes dehalogenation, but wait, in that case, you have two halogens across the ring. But in this case, we have only one bromine and a deuterium.

Wait, so benzene with Br and D adjacent. If I eliminate HBr, but wait, the D is in position 2. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen (not the D) from position 3, for example, then the Br would leave, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2? Or maybe a double bond?

Wait, let's think about the mechanism. If the base (NH2-) abstracts a hydrogen atom from a carbon adjacent to the bromine, that would create a carbanion adjacent to the Br. Then, the bromide would leave, forming a triple bond between the two carbons. Oh, wait, that's how benzynes are formed, typically from o-dihalobenzenes. So in the case of o-dibromobenzene, treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 would eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a triple bond (benzyne).

But wait, in our case, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So only one Br and one D. Can this molecule form a benzyne-like structure upon treatment with NaNH2?

Hmm. So in our case, the structure is Br at position 1 and D at position 2. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 (meta to D?), but wait, the positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), so the adjacent positions are 2 (deutero) and 4 (ortho to Br and meta to D).

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to the D and adjacent to the Br. So, the base abstracts H from position 3, leading to a negative charge at position 3, but wait, the Br is at position 1.

Wait, perhaps another approach. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, which is para to the Br and adjacent to position 3, which is ortho to the D. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base can abstract a hydrogen from position 2, but wait, that's the position with the deuterium. But deuterium is heavier than hydrogen, but the base is strong enough. Or maybe the base can't abstract D because it's a primary isotope effect. So perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is ortho to Br and meta to the D.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a single elimination. So when the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to bromine, the bromide leaves, forming a triple bond between the adjacent carbons. But in this case, do we have adjacent substituents?

Wait, 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene would have Br at position 1 and D at position 2. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, then the adjacent carbons are 2 and 3. But wait, position 2 has a D, not a hydrogen. So position 3 is adjacent to position 2 (D at 2, H at 3? No, wait, in benzene, position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4, but not 1.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out mentally. Benzene ring. Position 1: Br. Position 2: D. So positions 3 and 6 are adjacent to position 2, but position 3 is adjacent to position 2 and position 4. Wait, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, which is para to the Br and adjacent to position 3. So if the base abstracts H from position 4, then the Br would leave, and form a triple bond between C1 and C4? No, that can't be. Because the positions are 1 and 4, which are across the ring. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so 1 and 4 are across from each other, which would make a triple bond, but that's not feasible because benzene is a six-membered ring, and forming a triple bond across would require a four-membered ring, which isn't possible. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (deuterium), but position 3 is also adjacent to position 4. Hmm, but position 3 is meta to the Br, which is at position 1. Alternatively, perhaps it abstracts a hydrogen from position 6, which is ortho to Br and adjacent to position 5.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the possibility of elimination. The base (NH2-) can abstract a hydrogen from a position adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a triple bond between the adjacent carbons, releasing HBr.

But wait, in this case, the only possible adjacent positions to Br (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. But position 2 has a D, not a H. So, the base can abstract a H from position 6. So position 6 is adjacent to Br (position 1), and the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to elimination of Br and forming a triple bond between C1 and C6? But wait, C1 and C6 are adjacent? Yes, because in benzene, each position is connected to the next. So, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3, etc., 6 and 1. So C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6.

So, if the base abstracts H from C6, then C1 and C6 would each lose a substituent (Br from C1, H from C6), forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, the ring would then have a triple bond between C1 and C6, which would make the ring a triple bond, but that's impossible in a six-membered ring because triple bonds can't form in a six-membered ring without ring strain.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again. Benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. If we eliminate Br and H from adjacent positions, the ring would form a triple bond there. But that's not possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a diradical or a different structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up things. Benzene rings typically can't form triple bonds between adjacent carbons because that would require a four-membered ring or a smaller structure, which isn't feasible. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed that way.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the deuterium affects the reaction. Since deuterium is a heavier isotope, maybe it's less likely to be abstracted. So the base will abstract a hydrogen from another position, but in this molecule, the only adjacent position to Br that has a hydrogen is position 6 (if position 2 has a D, then position 6 is adjacent to Br and has an H).

So, when NaNH2 is added, it abstracts H from position 6. Then, the Br leaves as Br-, and the adjacent carbons (C1 and C6) lose H and Br, forming a triple bond between them. But since the benzene ring is six-membered, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6 would make a five-membered ring? No, wait, that's not possible. So, perhaps the ring would open up? Or maybe the structure rearranges.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a triple bond, but in a six-membered ring, that's not possible. So maybe this reaction isn't feasible, and no product forms. But that can't be, because the question says it's treated with NaNH2, so there must be a reaction.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possibility of elimination. If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D), and then the Br leaves, but position 3 is not adjacent to Br. So that wouldn't lead to a triple bond between Br and H.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is para to the Br. Then, Br would leave, but that leaves a ring with a triple bond between position 1 and 4, which is three carbons apart. That doesn't make sense because a triple bond can't be that long.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't about elimination but substitution. Could the NH2- act as a nucleophile? But in aromatic substitution, nucleophilic attack is not common unless the ring is activated towards nucleophilic substitution, which usually requires strong electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, but I'm not sure if it's enough for nucleophilic aromatic substitution without a strong activating group.

Wait, but in this case, the ring has a Br and a D. So if the NH2- attacks the ring, perhaps at the position para to Br. But that's just a guess, and I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond. But earlier I thought that's not possible.

Wait, another thought. Benzene rings can undergo elimination to form a diene if two adjacent substituents are present. But in this case, we have only one substituent (Br) and a D, which is not a leaving group.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a similar reaction. Oh, right! When you have a benzene ring with two halogens adjacent to each other (like o-dihalobenzene), treatment with a strong base like NaNH2 can lead to the elimination of both halogens, forming a triple bond (benzyne intermediate). But in our case, it's only a Br and a D adjacent. So, can the same thing happen?

Wait, but D isn't a leaving group. So, the base can abstract a hydrogen from the adjacent position, but with a D in position 2, maybe the base can't abstract it. So, perhaps the only available H is in position 6 (ortho to Br), which is adjacent to position 1. So the base would abstract H from position 6, Br leaves, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6. But wait, in a six-membered ring, that's adjacent, so the ring would have a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, which would make it a triple bond in the ring, creating a triple bond, but that's not possible in a six-membered ring. Wait, but benzene can't have a triple bond because that would require a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the ring would undergo some structural change. Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's unlikely because the question implies a product.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: How many products can form? The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction forms only one product, then the answer is B) 1. If it forms two, then C) 2.

Wait, but what if the deuterium affects the reaction in such a way that two different products form? Because the molecule can lose H from position 6, leading to a triple bond, but maybe the deuterium in position 2 could lead to a different outcome. Or maybe the reaction can't proceed, but the question says it's treated with NaNH2, so it must do something.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate but instead leads to a substitution. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3, which is meta to Br and adjacent to D. But that's not adjacent to Br; it's meta. So elimination wouldn't happen from there.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the base can't abstract the D, so the only possible elimination is from position 6. So the product would be a ring with a triple bond between C1 and C6, but that's a six-membered ring, which can't accommodate a triple bond. So perhaps the ring breaks, but I don't think that's a common pathway.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and the only product is the starting material. But the question says it's treated with NaNH2, implying a reaction occurs.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 4, leading to a different elimination. So if the base abstracts H from position 4, which is para to Br, then Br would leave, but that's not adjacent. So that wouldn't form a triple bond.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I need to think about the possible products. If the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene, and it undergoes elimination by losing HBr, the product would have a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, that's adjacent, so the ring would have a triple bond between those two, which would be a five-membered ring? No, that can't be. So perhaps the reaction can't proceed, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the deuterium is a problem. If the base can't abstract the D, then the only H available for elimination is from position 6. So the reaction forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, but that would require the ring to have a triple bond, which isn't possible in a six-membered ring. Therefore, the reaction can't proceed, and no products form. But the question says it's treated with NaNH2, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the reaction is a substitution. The NH2- acts as a nucleophile, attacking the benzene ring. But bromobenzene isn't very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution unless there's a strong activating group. But wait, the ring is deactivated by the Br, making nucleophilic substitution difficult. So perhaps that's not the pathway.

Wait, but sometimes, in the presence of strong bases, elimination can occur. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a deuterium in position 2 and a hydrogen in position 6 being abstracted, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a triple bond. But the ring can't have a triple bond, so perhaps the reaction doesn't happen. Or perhaps the ring opens, but that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium doesn't affect the reaction, and the base abstracts a H from position 6, leading to elimination of HBr and forming a triple bond, and thus a benzyne intermediate. But then, the ring would have a triple bond, which is a very reactive species.

Wait, but if the triple bond is formed between C1 and C6, that would be a six-membered ring with a triple bond between adjacent carbons. But that's impossible because benzene rings can't have triple bonds in such positions without breaking the ring. So maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question must have a solution.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 products. If the reaction leads to one product, the answer is B) 1. If two, then C) 2.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is causing the molecule to lose HBr, but due to the position of D, the base can abstract H from two different positions, leading to two different products. But I can't see how.

Alternatively, maybe the base can abstract H from either position 6 or position 4, leading to two different elimination products. But I'm not certain about that.

Wait, position 6 is adjacent to Br, so elimination would form a triple bond between 1 and 6, but that's adjacent. Position 4 is para to Br, so abstracting H from position 4 would not be adjacent, so elimination wouldn't form a triple bond. So perhaps only one elimination site is possible.

Wait, maybe the base can abstract H from position 3, which is adjacent to position 2 (D) but not Br. So elimination would form a triple bond between 2 and 3, but position 2 has a D, which isn't a leaving group. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't eliminate but leads to a substitution. If the NH2- attacks the ring, perhaps at the para position to Br, but I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the reaction leads to only one product. So the answer is B) 1.

Wait, but the deuterium is at position 2. Since D and H are different, maybe the reaction leads to different products based on which H is abstracted. Wait, but in this case, only position 6 has a H adjacent to Br. So the base can only abstract from position 6, leading to one product. So the answer is B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions. In this case, the base can abstract a hydrogen atom from a position adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between the two carbons involved in the elimination.

In 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. The only position adjacent to the bromine that has a hydrogen atom (rather than a deuterium) is position 6. The base (NH₂⁻) can abstract the hydrogen from position 6, leading to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This results in a single product, as the reaction pathway is specific and only one elimination site is possible.

The deuterium at position 2 does not interfere with the reaction because the base cannot abstract deuterium effectively, and the elimination occurs exclusively at position 6. Therefore, only one product is formed in this reaction.

Answer: B
