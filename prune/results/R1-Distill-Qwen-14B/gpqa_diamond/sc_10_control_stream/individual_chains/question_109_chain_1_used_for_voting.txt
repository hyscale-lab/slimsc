Alright, let's try to figure this out. Hmm, okay, so the question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. And we have some Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

The final state of the NN has T(NN) = 0. We need to figure out which partial wave is not allowed based on conservation laws—both angular momentum and parity.

Wait, let me start by understanding what each part means. The initial state is 1S0. So from the term symbol, 1S0 implies (2S+1)L(J). Wait, no, wait. The general term symbol is (2S+1)LJ, right? So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1, so S=0. Because 1 = 2*0 +1. So S=0. The L is S, so L=0. And J is 0. So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. So it's like a decay process: initial state (1S0) → final state (NN) + X. But the problem says that the final NN state has T=0.

Wait, but the Pauli condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Hmm. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system? Or wait, the question says "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)." So T, S, L are quantum numbers of the NN state.

Wait, but wait. The NN system after emission—so the system is in a state with certain T, S, L. The equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So that can be rewritten as T = (S + L) mod 2 + 1, but mod 2, so it's equivalent to T = (S+L +1) mod 2.

Wait, that's (S + L +1) mod 2 equals T mod 2. So T must be equal to (S+L+1) mod 2. Which implies that T and (S+L+1) have the same parity.

Given that T(NN) is 0, substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So (S + L +1) mod 2 =0.

Which means S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd. Because 0 mod 2 is even. So if 0 = (S+L +1) mod 2, then (S+L +1) is even → S+L must be odd.

So S + L is odd. So one of S or L is even, the other odd.

Now, the next part is about conservation of angular momentum and parity. The initial state has L=0, S=0, J=0. So the initial total angular momentum is J=0.

When the system emits a particle, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum of the final state (NN) and X must equal the initial J, which is 0.

So the total angular momentum J_final = J_NN + J_X. But wait, no. Wait, the total angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular momentum carried by each particle. Wait, no, the X is a single particle, so its angular momentum is well-defined as l (orbital) and s (spin). The NN system also has their own orbital and spin angular momentum.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the overall angular momentum conservation. The initial state has J=0, so the sum of the angular momenta of the final state (NN) and X must also add up to 0.

Wait, but the X is a single particle. So the NN system after emission is in a state with L_NN (orbital angular momentum) and S_NN (total spin of the two nucleons), so their total angular momentum is J_NN = L_NN + S_NN. Wait, no, actually, J is the total angular momentum, which combines orbital (L) and spin (S) as vectors. But for two-body systems, the total angular momentum J is the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L) and the total spin (S). So J = L + S.

But in the initial state, L=0 and S=0, so J=0.

After emission, the NN system will have some L_NN, S_NN, and J_NN. And the X will have its own orbital angular momentum l (relative to the NN system, perhaps) and spin s. But I'm not sure how exactly the angular momentum adds up here.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the entire process, the total angular momentum before and after should be conserved. So the initial total angular momentum is J=0.

After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum. But since X is emitted, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is determined by the state of NN.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a decay: 1S0 → NN' + X, but no, wait, the initial state is a system of two nucleons in 1S0, which emit a particle X. So perhaps the two nucleons (after emission) are in some state with quantum numbers L, S, T, and X carries away l and s.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to consider that the NN system (after emission) has its own L and S, and X has its own l and s. The total angular momentum J must be initial J=0, so J_NN + J_X =0. Or wait, perhaps the total angular momentum of the system after emission (NN + X) must equal the initial J=0.

Alternatively, perhaps think about parity conservation. The parity of the initial state is the parity of the 1S0 state. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^{L}. Since 1S0 has L=0, the parity is (-1)^0=1.

When the system emits X, the parity of the final state must equal the initial parity. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X. Because parity is multiplicative.

The parity of the NN system after emission is (-1)^{L_NN}, and the parity of X is given as -1. So, the total parity is (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} } = initial parity (1).

So, (-1)^{L_NN + l_X} } = 1.

Which implies that L_NN + l_X must be even. So L_NN + l_X is even. So L_NN ≡ l_X mod 2.

Now, let's look at the options. Each option gives the final NN state and the particle X.

Wait, the options are given as 1S0 → some state + a particle. For example, option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

Wait, so each option represents the decay process, where the initial state is 1S0 and the final state is NN in some state (like 7D1) and a proton (p) is emitted.

Wait, but wait, the particle X is emitted. So in each option, the NN system is in a state with certain quantum numbers, and X is another particle.

But perhaps it's better to think about each option as the decay 1S0 → (NN state) + X, and X has a certain angular momentum state.

Wait, the problem says that the options' lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. For example, in option A, the X is p, which I think refers to a proton, but the 'p' here is the angular momentum state, not the particle's name. Or wait, maybe the letters are just the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. Wait, the question says, "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." So 'p' would mean l=1 (P state), 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc.

Wait, no. The letters are the spectroscopic notation for l. So s is l=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.

So, for each option, the X is emitted with angular momentum state p, s, etc. So in option A, the X has l=1 (p state).

Wait, but the particle X is given to have intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1. So the X could be a pion, or a neutron, but in any case, its intrinsic parity is -1. But maybe that's not too important for this part, since we're considering the orbital angular momentum (which affects parity via (-1)^l).

Wait, but the parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because parity is multiplicative for independent particles.

The parity of X is determined by its intrinsic parity and its orbital angular momentum. So the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * intrinsic parity. The intrinsic parity is given as -1 for X. So the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) = (-1)^{l_X +1}.

The parity of the NN system after emission is (-1)^{L_NN}.

The total parity after emission should equal the initial parity, which is +1. So:

(-1)^{L_NN} * [ (-1)^{l_X + 1} ] = 1

Simplify this:

(-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = 1.

Which implies that L_NN + l_X + 1 must be even.

So, L_NN + l_X must be odd.

Because if L_NN + l_X +1 is even → L_NN + l_X is odd.

So, now, the first condition is that L_NN + l_X is odd.

The second condition comes from the Pauli statistics condition. Remember, the final NN state has T=0, so according to the condition given, T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

Which implies that S + L must be odd. So S_NN + L_NN is odd.

So, the two conditions we have are:

1. L_NN + l_X is odd.

2. S_NN + L_NN is odd.

Let me rephrase that.

From condition 1: L_NN is odd when l_X is even, and L_NN is even when l_X is odd.

Because L_NN + l_X is odd → their sum is odd → one even, the other odd.

Condition 2: S_NN + L_NN is odd → same logic, S and L must have opposite parity.

So, let's look at each option and see which one violates these conditions.

Each option gives the final NN state in a certain term. The term is (2S+1)LJ.

So for each option, for the final NN state, we can extract S, L, and J.

Once we have S and L, we can check if S + L is odd (condition 2). Also, for each option, we can see the l_X (from the particle's angular momentum state letter), then check condition 1: L_NN + l_X is odd.

If either condition is not met, that option is not allowed.

Let me go through each option.

Option A) 1S0 →7D1 + p.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is J=0, L=0, S=0.

The final NN state is 7D1. So 7D1 implies (2S+1) =7 → S=3 (because 2*3+1=7). L is D, which is l=2. So L=2.

So for the final NN state: S=3, L=2, J=1.

Now, condition 2: S + L =3 +2=5 → odd. So condition 2 is satisfied.

Now, the X is p, which is a P state → l_X=1.

Condition 1: L_NN=2 (from 7D1) plus l_X=1 → 2+1=3, which is odd. So condition 1 is satisfied.

So both conditions are met. So option A is allowed.

Option B) 1S0 →3S1 + p.

The final NN state is 3S1. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S, which is l=0. J=1.

So S=1, L=0.

Condition 2: S + L =1 +0=1 → odd. So condition 2 is satisfied.

X is p → l_X=1.

Condition1: L_NN=0 + l_X=1 → 1, which is odd → condition 1 satisfied.

So both conditions met. Option B is allowed.

Option C) 1S0 →3D3 + f.

The final NN state is 3D3. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D → l=2. J=3.

So S=1, L=2.

Condition 2: S + L =1 +2=3 → odd. Condition 2 is met.

X is f → l_X=3.

Condition 1: L_NN=2 + l_X=3 → 5, which is odd → condition 1 met.

So both conditions satisfied. Option C is allowed.

Option D) 1S0 →3P0 + s.

The final NN state is 3P0. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P → l=1. J=0.

So S=1, L=1.

Condition2: S + L =1 +1=2 → even. Oh, condition 2 requires that S + L is odd. So here, condition 2 is not met.

Wait, but wait, condition 2 says that S + L must be odd because T=0 implies that (S+L+1) mod 2 is 0. So S+L must be odd. In this option, S+L=2, which is even. So condition 2 is violated.

But let me double-check the final NN state. 3P0: so S=1, L=1, J=0.

So condition 2: 1 +1=2 → even. Which is not allowed because it must be odd. So D is not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe I should check condition 1 as well.

X is 's' → l_X=0.

Condition 1: L_NN=1 + l_X=0 → 1, which is odd. So condition 1 is met.

But condition 2 is not. So this option violates condition 2, so it's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps both conditions must be satisfied. Since condition 2 is violated, this option is not permitted.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The problem says that the Pauli condition is on the final NN state which has T=0. So for each case, the final NN state must satisfy the condition.

In option D, the final NN state is 3P0, which has S=1, L=1. Then, as per the given condition, T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T = (1 +1 +1) mod 2 → (3 mod2)=1. So T=1. But the question says the final NN has T=0. So this option's final state would have T=1, which doesn't meet the given condition. So that's a problem.

Wait, wait, maybe I misunderstood the condition. The condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So, for the final state, T = (S + L +1) mod 2. So in this case, S=1, L=1 → T = (1+1 +1) mod2 =3 mod2=1. So T=1. But the problem states that the final state has T=0. So this option is invalid because T=1, not 0. So this option must be invalid regardless of other conditions.

So this is the prohibited option.

Wait, that's another approach. For each option, the final NN state's T must be 0. So we can compute T for each option and see which ones have T=0.

Let me compute T for each option.

Option A: 7D1 → S=3, L=2. T = (3 +2 +1) mod2 → 6 mod2=0. So T=0. So allowed.

Option B:3S1 → S=1, L=0. T = (1 +0 +1) mod2 → 2 mod2=0. So T=0. Allowed.

Option C:3D3 → S=1, L=2. T= (1+2 +1) =4 mod2=0. T=0. Allowed.

Option D:3P0 → S=1, L=1. T= (1+1 +1)=3 mod2=1. So T=1. But the problem says the final state must have T=0. So this option is invalid.

Therefore, option D is the one that is not permitted.

Wait, but the question says, which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X, which is the lowercase letter. So for option D, the X is 's' → l=0, which has s state. But the problem is that the final state can't have T=0 because S=1, L=1 gives T=1. So option D is not allowed because it violates the Pauli condition, hence the partial wave (s state) is not allowed.

So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The system starts in the 1S0 state, which has \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = 1 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting a particle \( X \), the NN system is in a state with quantum numbers \( S_{\text{NN}} \), \( L_{\text{NN}} \), and \( T_{\text{NN}} \). The particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \( -1 \) and an orbital angular momentum \( l_X \). The total parity after emission must conserve the initial parity:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} \cdot (-1)^{l_X + 1} = 1.
   \]
   Simplifying, \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X \) must be odd.

3. **Pauli Condition**: For the final NN state, the isospin \( T_{\text{NN}} \), spin \( S_{\text{NN}} \), and orbital angular momentum \( L_{\text{NN}} \) satisfy:
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Since \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), this implies:
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Therefore, \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \) must be odd.

4. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 3 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \), \( J_{\text{NN}} = 1 \).
     - \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 3 + 2 = 5 \), which is odd (condition 3 satisfied).
     - \( X \) is \( p \), so \( l_X = 1 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is odd (condition 2 satisfied).
     - Both conditions are met; this option is allowed.

   - **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), \( J_{\text{NN}} = 1 \).
     - \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd (condition 3 satisfied).
     - \( X \) is \( p \), so \( l_X = 1 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is odd (condition 2 satisfied).
     - Both conditions are met; this option is allowed.

   - **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \), \( J_{\text{NN}} = 3 \).
     - \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is odd (condition 3 satisfied).
     - \( X \) is \( f \), so \( l_X = 3 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is odd (condition 2 satisfied).
     - Both conditions are met; this option is allowed.

   - **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( J_{\text{NN}} = 0 \).
     - \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even (condition 3 violated).
     - \( X \) is \( s \), so \( l_X = 0 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd (condition 2 satisfied).
     - Since condition 3 is violated, this option is not allowed.

5. **Conclusion**: The partial wave \( s \) in option D is not permitted because the final NN state does not satisfy the Pauli condition (\( T_{\text{NN}} \neq 0 \)).

**Answer: D**

Alright, let's try to figure this out. Hmm, okay, so the question is about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1. And we have some Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

The final state of the NN has T(NN) = 0. We need to figure out which partial wave is not allowed based on conservation laws—both angular momentum and parity.

Wait, let me start by understanding what each part means. The initial state is 1S0. So from the term symbol, 1S0 implies (2S+1)L(J). Wait, no, wait. The general term symbol is (2S+1)LJ, right? So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1, so S=0. Because 1 = 2*0 +1. So S=0. The L is S, so L=0. And J is 0. So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. So it's like a decay process: initial state (1S0) → final state (NN) + X. But the problem says that the final NN state has T=0.

Wait, but the Pauli condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Hmm. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system? Or wait, the question says "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)." So T, S, L are quantum numbers of the NN state.

Wait, but wait. The NN system after emission—so the system is in a state with certain T, S, L. The equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So that can be rewritten as T = (S + L) mod 2 + 1, but mod 2, so it's equivalent to T = (S+L +1) mod 2.

Wait, that's (S + L +1) mod 2 equals T mod 2. So T must be equal to (S+L+1) mod 2. Which implies that T and (S+L+1) have the same parity.

Given that T(NN) is 0, substituting into the equation: 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So (S + L +1) mod 2 =0.

Which means S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd. Because 0 mod 2 is even. So if 0 = (S+L +1) mod 2, then (S+L +1) is even → S+L must be odd.

So S + L is odd. So one of S or L is even, the other odd.

Now, the next part is about conservation of angular momentum and parity. The initial state has L=0, S=0, J=0. So the initial total angular momentum is J=0.

When the system emits a particle, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the total angular momentum of the final state (NN) and X must equal the initial J, which is 0.

So the total angular momentum J_final = J_NN + J_X. But wait, no. Wait, the total angular momentum is the sum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the angular momentum carried by each particle. Wait, no, the X is a single particle, so its angular momentum is well-defined as l (orbital) and s (spin). The NN system also has their own orbital and spin angular momentum.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the overall angular momentum conservation. The initial state has J=0, so the sum of the angular momenta of the final state (NN) and X must also add up to 0.

Wait, but the X is a single particle. So the NN system after emission is in a state with L_NN (orbital angular momentum) and S_NN (total spin of the two nucleons), so their total angular momentum is J_NN = L_NN + S_NN. Wait, no, actually, J is the total angular momentum, which combines orbital (L) and spin (S) as vectors. But for two-body systems, the total angular momentum J is the sum of the orbital angular momentum (L) and the total spin (S). So J = L + S.

But in the initial state, L=0 and S=0, so J=0.

After emission, the NN system will have some L_NN, S_NN, and J_NN. And the X will have its own orbital angular momentum l (relative to the NN system, perhaps) and spin s. But I'm not sure how exactly the angular momentum adds up here.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the entire process, the total angular momentum before and after should be conserved. So the initial total angular momentum is J=0.

After emission, the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum. But since X is emitted, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is determined by the state of NN.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a decay: 1S0 → NN' + X, but no, wait, the initial state is a system of two nucleons in 1S0, which emit a particle X. So perhaps the two nucleons (after emission) are in some state with quantum numbers L, S, T, and X carries away l and s.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to consider that the NN system (after emission) has its own L and S, and X has its own l and s. The total angular momentum J must be initial J=0, so J_NN + J_X =0. Or wait, perhaps the total angular momentum of the system after emission (NN + X) must equal the initial J=0.

Alternatively, perhaps think about parity conservation. The parity of the initial state is the parity of the 1S0 state. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^{L}. Since 1S0 has L=0, the parity is (-1)^0=1.

When the system emits X, the parity of the final state must equal the initial parity. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X. Because parity is multiplicative.

The parity of the NN system after emission is (-1)^{L_NN}, and the parity of X is given as -1. So, the total parity is (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X} } = initial parity (1).

So, (-1)^{L_NN + l_X} } = 1.

Which implies that L_NN + l_X must be even. So L_NN + l_X is even. So L_NN ≡ l_X mod 2.

Now, let's look at the options. Each option gives the final NN state and the particle X.

Wait, the options are given as 1S0 → some state + a particle. For example, option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

Wait, so each option represents the decay process, where the initial state is 1S0 and the final state is NN in some state (like 7D1) and a proton (p) is emitted.

Wait, but wait, the particle X is emitted. So in each option, the NN system is in a state with certain quantum numbers, and X is another particle.

But perhaps it's better to think about each option as the decay 1S0 → (NN state) + X, and X has a certain angular momentum state.

Wait, the problem says that the options' lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. For example, in option A, the X is p, which I think refers to a proton, but the 'p' here is the angular momentum state, not the particle's name. Or wait, maybe the letters are just the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. Wait, the question says, "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X." So 'p' would mean l=1 (P state), 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc.

Wait, no. The letters are the spectroscopic notation for l. So s is l=0, p=1, d=2, f=3, etc.

So, for each option, the X is emitted with angular momentum state p, s, etc. So in option A, the X has l=1 (p state).

Wait, but the particle X is given to have intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1. So the X could be a pion, or a neutron, but in any case, its intrinsic parity is -1. But maybe that's not too important for this part, since we're considering the orbital angular momentum (which affects parity via (-1)^l).

Wait, but the parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because parity is multiplicative for independent particles.

The parity of X is determined by its intrinsic parity and its orbital angular momentum. So the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * intrinsic parity. The intrinsic parity is given as -1 for X. So the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X} * (-1) = (-1)^{l_X +1}.

The parity of the NN system after emission is (-1)^{L_NN}.

The total parity after emission should equal the initial parity, which is +1. So:

(-1)^{L_NN} * [ (-1)^{l_X + 1} ] = 1

Simplify this:

(-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = 1.

Which implies that L_NN + l_X + 1 must be even.

So, L_NN + l_X must be odd.

Because if L_NN + l_X +1 is even → L_NN + l_X is odd.

So, now, the first condition is that L_NN + l_X is odd.

The second condition comes from the Pauli statistics condition. Remember, the final NN state has T=0, so according to the condition given, T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

Which implies that S + L must be odd. So S_NN + L_NN is odd.

So, the two conditions we have are:

1. L_NN + l_X is odd.

2. S_NN + L_NN is odd.

Let me rephrase that.

From condition 1: L_NN is odd when l_X is even, and L_NN is even when l_X is odd.

Because L_NN + l_X is odd → their sum is odd → one even, the other odd.

Condition 2: S_NN + L_NN is odd → same logic, S and L must have opposite parity.

So, let's look at each option and see which one violates these conditions.

Each option gives the final NN state in a certain term. The term is (2S+1)LJ.

So for each option, for the final NN state, we can extract S, L, and J.

Once we have S and L, we can check if S + L is odd (condition 2). Also, for each option, we can see the l_X (from the particle's angular momentum state letter), then check condition 1: L_NN + l_X is odd.

If either condition is not met, that option is not allowed.

Let me go through each option.

Option A) 1S0 →7D1 + p.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is J=0, L=0, S=0.

The final NN state is 7D1. So 7D1 implies (2S+1) =7 → S=3 (because 2*3+1=7). L is D, which is l=2. So L=2.

So for the final NN state: S=3, L=2, J=1.

Now, condition 2: S + L =3 +2=5 → odd. So condition 2 is satisfied.

Now, the X is p, which is a P state → l_X=1.

Condition 1: L_NN=2 (from 7D1) plus l_X=1 → 2+1=3, which is odd. So condition 1 is satisfied.

So both conditions are met. So option A is allowed.

Option B) 1S0 →3S1 + p.

The final NN state is 3S1. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S, which is l=0. J=1.

So S=1, L=0.

Condition 2: S + L =1 +0=1 → odd. So condition 2 is satisfied.

X is p → l_X=1.

Condition1: L_NN=0 + l_X=1 → 1, which is odd → condition 1 satisfied.

So both conditions met. Option B is allowed.

Option C) 1S0 →3D3 + f.

The final NN state is 3D3. (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D → l=2. J=3.

So S=1, L=2.

Condition 2: S + L =1 +2=3 → odd. Condition 2 is met.

X is f → l_X=3.

Condition 1: L_NN=2 + l_X=3 → 5, which is odd → condition 1 met.

So both conditions satisfied. Option C is allowed.

Option D) 1S0 →3P0 + s.

The final NN state is 3P0. So (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P → l=1. J=0.

So S=1, L=1.

Condition2: S + L =1 +1=2 → even. Oh, condition 2 requires that S + L is odd. So here, condition 2 is not met.

Wait, but wait, condition 2 says that S + L must be odd because T=0 implies that (S+L+1) mod 2 is 0. So S+L must be odd. In this option, S+L=2, which is even. So condition 2 is violated.

But let me double-check the final NN state. 3P0: so S=1, L=1, J=0.

So condition 2: 1 +1=2 → even. Which is not allowed because it must be odd. So D is not allowed.

Alternatively, maybe I should check condition 1 as well.

X is 's' → l_X=0.

Condition 1: L_NN=1 + l_X=0 → 1, which is odd. So condition 1 is met.

But condition 2 is not. So this option violates condition 2, so it's not allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps both conditions must be satisfied. Since condition 2 is violated, this option is not permitted.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The problem says that the Pauli condition is on the final NN state which has T=0. So for each case, the final NN state must satisfy the condition.

In option D, the final NN state is 3P0, which has S=1, L=1. Then, as per the given condition, T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T = (1 +1 +1) mod 2 → (3 mod2)=1. So T=1. But the question says the final NN has T=0. So this option's final state would have T=1, which doesn't meet the given condition. So that's a problem.

Wait, wait, maybe I misunderstood the condition. The condition is given as T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So, for the final state, T = (S + L +1) mod 2. So in this case, S=1, L=1 → T = (1+1 +1) mod2 =3 mod2=1. So T=1. But the problem states that the final state has T=0. So this option is invalid because T=1, not 0. So this option must be invalid regardless of other conditions.

So this is the prohibited option.

Wait, that's another approach. For each option, the final NN state's T must be 0. So we can compute T for each option and see which ones have T=0.

Let me compute T for each option.

Option A: 7D1 → S=3, L=2. T = (3 +2 +1) mod2 → 6 mod2=0. So T=0. So allowed.

Option B:3S1 → S=1, L=0. T = (1 +0 +1) mod2 → 2 mod2=0. So T=0. Allowed.

Option C:3D3 → S=1, L=2. T= (1+2 +1) =4 mod2=0. T=0. Allowed.

Option D:3P0 → S=1, L=1. T= (1+1 +1)=3 mod2=1. So T=1. But the problem says the final state must have T=0. So this option is invalid.

Therefore, option D is the one that is not permitted.

Wait, but the question says, which partial wave is not permitted. The partial wave refers to the orbital angular momentum quantum number of X, which is the lowercase letter. So for option D, the X is 's' → l=0, which has s state. But the problem is that the final state can't have T=0 because S=1, L=1 gives T=1. So option D is not allowed because it violates the Pauli condition, hence the partial wave (s state) is not allowed.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The system starts in the 1S0 state, which has \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = 1 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting a particle \( X \), the NN system is in a state with quantum numbers \( S_{\text{NN}} \), \( L_{\text{NN}} \), and \( T_{\text{NN}} \). The particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \( -1 \) and an orbital angular momentum \( l_X \). The total parity after emission must conserve the initial parity:
   \[
   (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} \cdot (-1)^{l_X + 1} = 1.
   \]
   Simplifying, \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X \) must be odd.

3. **Pauli Condition**: For the final NN state, the isospin \( T_{\text{NN}} \), spin \( S_{\text{NN}} \), and orbital angular momentum \( L_{\text{NN}} \) satisfy:
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Since \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), this implies:
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]
   Therefore, \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \) must be odd.

4. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 7D1 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 3 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \), \( J_{\text{NN}} = 1 \).
     - \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 3 + 2 = 5 \), which is odd (condition 3 satisfied).
     - \( X \) is \( p \), so \( l_X = 1 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is odd (condition 2 satisfied).
     - Both conditions are met; this option is allowed.

   - **Option B**: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3S1 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), \( J_{\text{NN}} = 1 \).
     - \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd (condition 3 satisfied).
     - \( X \) is \( p \), so \( l_X = 1 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is odd (condition 2 satisfied).
     - Both conditions are met; this option is allowed.

   - **Option C**: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \), \( J_{\text{NN}} = 3 \).
     - \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is odd (condition 3 satisfied).
     - \( X \) is \( f \), so \( l_X = 3 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 2 + 3 = 5 \), which is odd (condition 2 satisfied).
     - Both conditions are met; this option is allowed.

   - **Option D**: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)
     - Final NN state: \( 3P0 \), so \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \), \( J_{\text{NN}} = 0 \).
     - \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even (condition 3 violated).
     - \( X \) is \( s \), so \( l_X = 0 \). \( L_{\text{NN}} + l_X = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd (condition 2 satisfied).
     - Since condition 3 is violated, this option is not allowed.

5. **Conclusion**: The partial wave \( s \) in option D is not permitted because the final NN state does not satisfy the Pauli condition (\( T_{\text{NN}} \neq 0 \)).
