Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, since p orbitals have l=1. The problem gives a coupled angular momentum state represented as |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, when you couple two angular momenta, the total l is the sum of l1 and l2, right? So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, so the maximum possible l is 2, which matches the state given. So the state is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total angular momentum quantum number, and M is the z-component.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of these operators corresponds to the z-component of the angular momentum for each electron. So L1z has eigenvalues m1 * ħ, and L2z has eigenvalues m2 * ħ, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron.

Wait, but the state given is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the total angular momentum state has M = -1. Now, when you measure L1z and L2z, you're essentially measuring the individual m1 and m2 values.

But wait, in the coupled state, the individual m1 and m2 are not fixed. The state is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 that add up to M = -1. So to find the probability of getting m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because that would give L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ, I think.

Wait, but wait, each electron's spin isn't being considered here, but the problem says to ignore spin, so we're only dealing with orbital angular momentum.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state of maximum L (since l1 and l2 are both 1, maximum L is 2). Now, the coupled state can be written as a combination of the product states |l1 m1> |l2 m2>, such that their sum m1 + m2 equals M = -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of all possible |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but how exactly is that state expressed? Because in the coupled basis, you have to consider all the possible combinations. Let me think about how the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work here. The state |1,1,2,-1> would be a particular combination of the product states.

Wait, another approach: the state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the possible m1 and m2 values that add up to M are m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) but wait, wait, wait, m1 can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron. So for M=-1, the possible pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.

Wait, m1=1 and m2=-2? No, because m2 can't be -2 when l2 is 1. So the only possible m2 is -1, 0, +1. So m1 + m2 = -1 can have m1 = -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=-1. Are there any others?

Wait, m1 could be 1 and m2=-2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So no, that's not possible. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Wait, but then when you have two p orbitals combining, the state |1,1,2,M> would include all possible m1 and m2 that sum to M. So for M=-1, the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states.

Wait, but wait, the state |1,1,2,-1> is expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But how are the coefficients determined? Oh, right, that's where the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come in. But maybe I don't need the exact coefficients because the question is about the probability when both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So each of those would correspond to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, but m1 + m2 must be M = -1. So if m1 is -1, then m2 must be 0. And if m2 is -1, then m1 is 0. So the only product states in this coupled state are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Thus, the pair (m1=-1, m2=-1) is not present in the state |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, because m1=-1 and m2=-1 would sum to -2, which is not equal to M=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include the |m1=-1, m2=-1> component. Therefore, the probability of finding both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). The state can be written as a linear combination of these two. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a sum of a| -1,0> and b|0,-1>, with |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Therefore, when you measure L1z and L2z, you could get either m1=-1, m2=0 or m1=0, m2=-1. The (m1=-1, m2=-1) case is not part of this state, because that would sum to -2, not -1. So the coefficient for the |m1=-1, m2=-1> state is zero in the |1,1,2,-1> state.

Thus, the probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ (which corresponds to m1=-1 and m2=-1) would be zero. So the answer should be D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state represented as $|l_1, l_2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, $l = 2$ is the total angular momentum quantum number, and $m = -1$ is the z-component of the total angular momentum. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, which corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$.

In the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$, the total angular momentum $M = -1$ implies that $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs that satisfy this condition are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$. These pairs correspond to the product states $|m_1, m_2>$ that make up the coupled state. Importantly, the pair $(m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1)$ is not part of this state because $m_1 + m_2 = -2$ in this case, which does not match $M = -1$. Therefore, the coefficient of the $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ state in the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ is zero.

Since the $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1>$ component is absent in the coupled state, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is zero.

So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, so the maximum possible l is 2, which matches the state given. So the state is |l1, l2, L, M>, where L is the total angular momentum quantum number, and M is the z-component.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of these operators corresponds to the z-component of the angular momentum for each electron. So L1z has eigenvalues m1 * ħ, and L2z has eigenvalues m2 * ħ, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron.

Wait, but the state given is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the total angular momentum state has M = -1. Now, when you measure L1z and L2z, you're essentially measuring the individual m1 and m2 values.

But wait, in the coupled state, the individual m1 and m2 are not fixed. The state is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 that add up to M = -1. So to find the probability of getting m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because that would give L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ, I think.

Wait, but wait, each electron's spin isn't being considered here, but the problem says to ignore spin, so we're only dealing with orbital angular momentum.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state of maximum L (since l1 and l2 are both 1, maximum L is 2). Now, the coupled state can be written as a combination of the product states |l1 m1> |l2 m2>, such that their sum m1 + m2 equals M = -1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of all possible |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, but how exactly is that state expressed? Because in the coupled basis, you have to consider all the possible combinations. Let me think about how the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients work here. The state |1,1,2,-1> would be a particular combination of the product states.

Wait, another approach: the state is |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1>. So the possible m1 and m2 values that add up to M are m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) but wait, wait, wait, m1 can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron. So for M=-1, the possible pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.

Wait, m1=1 and m2=-2? No, because m2 can't be -2 when l2 is 1. So the only possible m2 is -1, 0, +1. So m1 + m2 = -1 can have m1 = -1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=-1. Are there any others?

Wait, m1 could be 1 and m2=-2, but m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So no, that's not possible. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1, 0) and (0, -1).

Wait, but then when you have two p orbitals combining, the state |1,1,2,M> would include all possible m1 and m2 that sum to M. So for M=-1, the possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of these two product states.

Wait, but wait, the state |1,1,2,-1> is expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But how are the coefficients determined? Oh, right, that's where the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come in. But maybe I don't need the exact coefficients because the question is about the probability when both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So each of those would correspond to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1.

Wait, but m1 + m2 must be M = -1. So if m1 is -1, then m2 must be 0. And if m2 is -1, then m1 is 0. So the only product states in this coupled state are (-1,0) and (0,-1). Thus, the pair (m1=-1, m2=-1) is not present in the state |1,1,2,-1>.

Wait, because m1=-1 and m2=-1 would sum to -2, which is not equal to M=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> doesn't include the |m1=-1, m2=-1> component. Therefore, the probability of finding both m1 and m2 as -1 is zero.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think again. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible m1 and m2 pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1). The state can be written as a linear combination of these two. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a sum of a| -1,0> and b|0,-1>, with |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Therefore, when you measure L1z and L2z, you could get either m1=-1, m2=0 or m1=0, m2=-1. The (m1=-1, m2=-1) case is not part of this state, because that would sum to -2, not -1. So the coefficient for the |m1=-1, m2=-1> state is zero in the |1,1,2,-1> state.

Thus, the probability of getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ (which corresponds to m1=-1 and m2=-1) would be zero. So the answer should be D) 0.
