Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, so this must be a spin-½ system.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? And σ · n would be the dot product, so it's σx nx + σy ny + σz nz. Since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1.

The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, det(H - λI) = 0. But for a 2x2 matrix, maybe there's a smarter way. I think for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±ℏ/2, but wait, that's for each individual Pauli matrix. But in this problem, H is a combination of them scaled by ε.

Wait, no, in this case, the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices multiplied by ε. Let me think about the general form. The Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1/2 when scaled by ℏ/2. Wait, no, each Pauli matrix, when multiplied by ℏ/2, has eigenvalues ±ℏ/2. Because, for σz, for example, the eigenvalues are ±1, so when multiplied by (ℏ/2), they become ±ℏ/2.

Wait, but in this problem, H is ε times σ · n. Let me write H as ε (σ · n). So, σ · n is a matrix, and when multiplied by ε, it's the Hamiltonian.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. The general form for σ · n is nx σx + ny σy + nz σz. Each σi has eigenvalues ±1, right? Because each σi squared is the identity matrix, so when you diagonalize σ · n, which is a vector in some direction, its eigenvalues are the magnitude. The magnitude of σ · n would be sqrt(n.x^2 + n.y^2 + n.z^2) which is 1, since n is a unit vector.

Wait, wait, for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because (σ · n)^2 = (σ · n)(σ · n) = (n · σ)(n · σ) = (n · σ)^2. Let me compute that: expanding (n · σ)^2 = n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + ... ) etc. But each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), so n_x^2 σ_x^2 = n_x^2 I, same for others. The cross terms: σ_x σ_y = (i σ_z)/2 or something? Hmm, but when n is a unit vector, the sum n_x^2 + n_y^2 +n_z^2 = 1.

Wait, actually, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. That would be n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z).

But each σ_i^2 is I. So the first three terms sum to (n_x² + n_y² +n_z²) I = I, since n is unit. The cross terms: remember that σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k + δ_ij I. So σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, etc. But when you have σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x = 2i σ_z? Wait, no, because σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k + δ_ij I. So the product σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I. So for each cross term in the expansion, like 2 n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, that's 2 n_x n_y (i σ_z), right?

Wait, but when you square σ · n, the cross terms would involve products like σ_x σ_y and σ_y σ_x, which when summed, give 2 δ_xy I. But since n is a unit vector, the cross terms would sum to zero? No, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps to compute (σ · n)^2, I can use the identity that (σ · a)(σ · b) = σ · a σ · b = a · b I + i σ · (a × b). So when a = b = n, then it's (n · n) I + i σ · (n × n). But n × n is zero, so (σ · n)^2 = (n · n) I = I. Because n is a unit vector, so n · n =1. Therefore, (σ · n)^2 = I.

So that's a key point. Therefore, σ · n is a Hermitian matrix (since Pauli matrices are Hermitian and n is real) with eigenvalues ±1, because (σ · n)^2 is I, so its eigenvalues must be either +1 or -1.

So that would mean that the eigenvalues of H = ε (σ · n) are ε * (+1) and ε * (-1), which are ±ε.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm. Because the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so scaling by ε would give eigenvalues ± ε. So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

Looking at the options:

Option B is +ε, -ε.

Option C is ± ε ħ/2. Hmm, why would it have ħ/2? Oh, perhaps the confusion comes from spin operators. The spin operator is S = (ℏ/2) σ. So S · n would have eigenvalues ± ℏ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, which isn't scaled by ℏ/2. So the eigenvalues should be ± ε.

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure. For the spin-½ system, the spin operator is S_i = (ℏ/2) σ_i. So the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field in direction n would be proportional to S · n, which is (ℏ/2) σ · n. Thus, the eigenvalues would be ± (ℏ/2) times some factor. But in our problem, H is ε σ · n, so the eigenvalues are ± ε.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Option B is ± ε. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I've missed something. Let's think about the trace and determinant. The trace of H is zero, since σ · n is traceless (each Pauli matrix is traceless). So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The product is determinant. The determinant of H is determinant(ε σ ·n).

Because σ ·n is (σ ·n), which is a traceless matrix, and its square is I as we found earlier. So (σ ·n)^2 = I, so the determinant of σ ·n is (product of eigenvalues) = (+1)*(-1) = -1. So determinant of σ ·n is -1. Thus, determinant of H is (ε)^2 * (-1) = -ε².

So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ1 + λ2 = 0 (trace) and λ1 λ2 = -ε². So the solutions are λ = ± sqrt( (0/2)^2 + ε² ) *something? Wait, wait:

The characteristic equation is λ^2 - (trace H) λ + det H = 0. Since trace H is zero, it's λ^2 + (-ε^2) = 0. So λ^2 = ε², so λ = ± ε. Right, so the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

So the correct answer is option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant. To determine the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the properties of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, weighted by the components of the unit vector \( \vec{n} \). A key property of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is that it is Hermitian, and its eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), meaning the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \).

When scaled by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \). This can also be confirmed by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(H - \lambda I) = 0 \). The trace of \( H \) is zero (since \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is traceless), and the determinant of \( H \) is \( -\varepsilon^2 \). Solving the characteristic equation \( \lambda^2 = \varepsilon^2 \), the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = \pm \varepsilon \).

Among the given options, the correct eigenvalues are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \), which correspond to **Option B**.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? And σ · n would be the dot product, so it's σx nx + σy ny + σz nz. Since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1.

Because, for σz, for example, the eigenvalues are ±1, so when multiplied by (ℏ/2), they become ±ℏ/2.

Wait, but in this problem, H is ε times σ · n. Let me write H as ε (σ · n). So, σ · n is a matrix, and when multiplied by ε, it's the Hamiltonian.

Because each σi squared is the identity matrix, so when you diagonalize σ · n, which is a vector in some direction, its eigenvalues are the magnitude. The magnitude of σ · n would be sqrt(n.x^2 + n.y^2 + n.z^2) which is 1, since n is a unit vector.

Wait, wait, for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because (σ · n)^2 = (σ · n)(σ · n) = (n · σ)(n · σ) = (n · σ)^2. Let me compute that: expanding (n · σ)^2 = n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + ... ) etc. But each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), so n_x^2 σ_x^2 = n_x^2 I, same for others. The cross terms: σ_x σ_y = (i σ_z)/2 or something? Hmm, but when n is a unit vector, the sum n_x^2 + n_y^2 +n_z^2 = 1.

Wait, actually, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. That would be n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z).

But each σ_i^2 is I. So the first three terms sum to (n_x² + n_y² +n_z²) I = I, since n is unit. The cross terms: remember that σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k + δ_ij I. So σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, etc. But when you have σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x = 2i σ_z? Wait, no, because σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k + δ_ij I. So the product σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I. So for each cross term in the expansion, like 2 n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, that's 2 n_x n_y (i σ_z), right?

Wait, but when you square σ · n, the cross terms would involve products like σ_x σ_y and σ_y σ_x, which when summed, give 2 δ_xy I. But since n is a unit vector, the cross terms would sum to zero? No, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps to compute (σ · n)^2, I can use the identity that (σ · a)(σ · b) = σ · a σ · b = a · b I + i σ · (a × b). So when a = b = n, then it's (n · n) I + i σ · (n × n). But n × n is zero, so (σ · n)^2 = (n · n) I = I. Because n is a unit vector, so n · n =1. Therefore, (σ · n)^2 = I.

So that's a key point. Therefore, σ · n is a Hermitian matrix (since Pauli matrices are Hermitian and n is real) with eigenvalues ±1, because (σ · n)^2 is I, so its eigenvalues must be either +1 or -1.

So that would mean that the eigenvalues of H = ε (σ · n) are ε * (+1) and ε * (-1), which are ±ε.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm. Because the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so scaling by ε would give eigenvalues ± ε. So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

Option B is +ε, -ε.

But in our problem, H is ε σ · n, so the eigenvalues are ± ε.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Option B is ± ε. So that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I've missed something. Let's think about the trace and determinant. The trace of H is zero, since σ · n is traceless (each Pauli matrix is traceless). So the sum of eigenvalues is zero. The product is determinant. The determinant of H is determinant(ε σ ·n).

So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ1 + λ2 = 0 (trace) and λ1 λ2 = -ε². So the solutions are λ = ± sqrt( (0/2)^2 + ε² ) *something? Wait, wait:

The characteristic equation is λ^2 - (trace H) λ + det H = 0. Since trace H is zero, it's λ^2 + (-ε^2) = 0. So λ^2 = ε², so λ = ± ε. Right, so the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε.

So the correct answer is option B.
