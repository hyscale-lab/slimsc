Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and under what conditions it's valid. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me the Mott-Gurney equation: J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I remember that this equation relates the current density J to the voltage V in a semiconductor device. The parameters are ε (dielectric constant), μ (mobility), and L (device length).

The options are four different statements about when this equation applies. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

From what I recall, the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under specific assumptions. The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime implies that the current is limited by the space charge—that is, the electric field is so strong that it's the space charge itself that's limiting the current, not other factors like series resistance or injection barriers.

So, what are the key assumptions here? I think the Mott-Gurney equation assumes a single-carrier device. Because if you have both electrons and holes contributing, that's a different situation, and the equation might not hold. So options D, which mentions two-carrier, might not be right.

Also, I remember that the equation is valid when there's negligible injection, meaning the contacts are Ohmic. Ohmic contacts imply that there's no significant barrier for carriers to cross the contact. So if the contacts are Ohmic, you don't have issues with carrier injection limits. If there's a Schottky contact, there's a barrier which could complicate things, so that might not fit the Mott-Gurney conditions.

Wait, another point: the derivation also assumes that the space charge is such that the electric field is uniform. That probably requires that the space charge is within the bulk of the semiconductor, not near the contacts. So if the contacts are Ohmic, maybe that's a condition where the space charge builds up in the bulk rather than being limited by the contacts.

The equation is also for cases where the current is dominated by drift and not by diffusion. Because in the derivation, I think the assumption is that the current is due to the electric field (drift) rather than the concentration gradient (diffusion). So if the diffusion current is negligible, the equation holds.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, no. The equation is for drift-limited current, so drift is not negligible. So if the statement says drift current is negligible, that can't be right. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. Hmm. So no injection barriers would imply Ohmic contacts, which fits. And negligible diffusion current—yes, because in the SCLC regime, the current is mainly due to drift, so diffusion is negligible. So this seems plausible.

Option C: Single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. Schottky contacts have barriers, which might introduce complications. I think the Mott-Gurney equation assumes the contacts are Ohmic so that the space charge builds up in the bulk. Schottky might not fit, so C is probably wrong.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contacts. No, because the equation is for single-carrier, so D is out.

So between options B and the others. Wait, the equation is for when the current is limited by space charge, which occurs at high voltages. The condition is that the space charge is so much that the electric field is modified, and the current is determined by the space charge. For that, I think you don't have any barriers (Ohmic) so that the carriers can move freely. So B says no carrier injection barrier, which aligns with Ohmic contacts.

So the correct statement is option B: valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.

The Mott-Gurney equation, which describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, is derived under specific assumptions. These include a single-carrier device, negligible diffusion current, and conditions where the current is dominated by drift. Additionally, the equation assumes an Ohmic contact, meaning there is no significant carrier injection barrier, and the space charge builds up in the bulk of the semiconductor rather than being limited by the contacts.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation assumes drift current is significant, not negligible.

- **Option B** states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, as it assumes Ohmic contacts (no injection barrier) and negligible diffusion current.

- **Option C** states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. This is incorrect because Schottky contacts introduce barriers, which complicate the space-charge-limited current regime and are not consistent with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.

- **Option D** states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation is specifically for single-carrier devices.

Thus, the correct statement is **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.
