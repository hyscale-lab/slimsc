Okay, so I've got this question about barley and genetic mutations. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the situation is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this anti-nutritional compound that's making it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible for this compound and it has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the gene sequences. The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The options are Mutant 1 to 4, and each has a slightly different sequence in the first exon area. I need to figure out which mutation is the best candidate.

Wait, the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene's product, right? So if the gene is producing an enzyme or something that makes the compound, a mutation that disrupts the gene's function would stop the compound from being made. So the goal is to find a mutation that likely inactivates the gene.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutants have changes in the first exon. The wild type is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Let me see each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to wild type, seems like the 5th and 6th nucleotides. Wild type is TT, mutant has CT. So the first few bases are different. Let me write them out.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT ... Hmm, wait, let me check each position.

Wait, the sequences start with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me see the first few nucleotides:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So, position 4 is T in wild type, and C in mutant. Then position 5: T in wild, A in mutant. So the first few codons change.

Wait, coding sequence. The first exon is the beginning, so it's part of the coding region. So any changes might affect the amino acids.

Mutant 2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Looking at the first part: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT... So the next few bases. Let me see.

Wild type after ATG is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So in mutant 2, after ATG, it's TTC TAA GCT... So positions 4-6: wild is TCT, mutant is TAA.

So the codons would change. Hmm.

Mutant 3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT... Comparing to wild type: after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So, in mutant 3, the third codon is TAC instead of CTC, and later, in the sequence, perhaps a change in the amino acid.

Mutant 4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Here, the sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG... So the wild type after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So, in mutant 4, the fourth codon is ACT instead of GGT.

Wait, so mutant 4 may have a large deletion or some change in the exons.

Now, the question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. So I'm looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. That could be a nonsense mutation (early stop codon), a frameshift, or a missense mutation in a critical area.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Let's see the amino acids. The first codon is ATG (start), then TTT becomes TTC. TTT is Phe, TTC is also Phe. So no change there. Next codon: CTC (Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr). So Leu to Tyr. Then GCT (Ala) stays the same. So this is a missense mutation. But not a stop codon.

Mutant 2: After ATG, TTC (Ph) is same as before. Then TAA is a stop codon. Oh wait, TAA is a stop codon (amber stop). So in mutant 2, after the first two codons (Met, Phe), the next codon is TAA, which would cause a premature stop. So the protein would be truncated early. That could disrupt the gene's function, perhaps making it nonfunctional. So this would be a nonsense mutation.

Mutant 3: After ATG, TTT remains Phe. Next codon is TAC (Tyr), instead of CTC (Leu). So another missense. Then GCT remains Ala. Then GGT becomes GTC (Val). Wait, but the rest... Hmm, does this affect the function? Maybe, but it's still a functional protein unless it's a critical change.

Mutant 4: The sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), then TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Wait, the third codon: wild type is CTC (Leu), mutant is TAC (Tyr). Then GCT (Ala) becomes ACT (Thr). So, multiple changes. But wait, looking further, perhaps the exons are structured. The wild type has exons, so if there's a mutation in the exon, such as a frameshift, it could cause a truncation or a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but in the given sequences, all the mutations are within the first exon. So does any of them cause a frameshift or a stop codon?

Looking back:

Mutant 2: TAA is a stop codon. So the coding sequence would end early. That would disrupt the protein. If the protein is truncated early, it might not function, leading to the compound not being made.

Mutant 4: Let's see the sequence. Wild type is ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCT... So the exon includes the GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc. Mutant 4's sequence: ...CTCGCTACTTCT... So instead of GGT, it's ACT. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me write the sequences to compare for each mutant, focusing on the first part.

Wild type: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
So positions:

Positions 4-6: TTT -> TTC (no change in amino acid, Phe remains)
Positions 7-9: CTC -> TAC (Leu to Tyr)
So the second amino acid is same, third is different.

Mutant 2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Positions 4-6: TTT -> TTC (same)
Positions 7-9: CTC -> TAA (Leu becomes stop)
So after two amino acids, it stops. That's a strong candidate for loss of function.

Mutant 3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT...
Positions 4-6: same as wild (TTT)
Positions 7-9: CTC -> TAC (Leu to Tyr)
Positions 10-12: GCT same
Positions 13-15: GGT -> GTC (Gly to Val)
So again, missense mutations but no stop.

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...
So the sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), then TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr). In wild, after TTT comes CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), then GGT (Gly). So in mutant4, perhaps a deletion of the GGT codon? Or a substitution.

Wait, the wild type has the sequence: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant4's sequence: ...CTCGCTACTTCT...

So instead of GGT, it's ACT. So the fourth codon is ACT (Thr), instead of GGT (Gly). So again, a missense mutation. But is there a frame shift? Let me count the nucleotides.

Wait, no. Looking at the sequences, all appear to be in the same reading frame. Because the changes are substitutions, not insertions or deletions.

So, in terms of disrupting the gene, a nonsense mutation (like in Mutant 2) would cause the mRNA to be translated until the stop codon, leading to a shorter, possibly nonfunctional protein. Missense mutations could disrupt function if they change a critical amino acid, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

The question is about which mutation would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So the most effective would be a mutation that leads to a nonfunctional gene product. The best way is to introduce a premature stop codon.

So Mutant 2 introduces TAA at the third codon. TAA is a stop codon, so the protein would be truncated. That would likely inactivate the gene, stopping the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

So the correct answer would be option A) Mutant 2.

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This could occur through a nonsense mutation (introducing a premature stop codon) or a frameshift mutation. The question focuses on missense mutations within the first exon, so we analyze each mutant for changes that could inactivate the gene.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild Type Sequence**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   The sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and includes several codons before the stop codon (TGA).

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   `5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - The first codon (ATG) remains unchanged.  
   - The second codon (TTT → TTC) is a synonymous mutation (Phe to Phe).  
   - The third codon (CTC → TAC) changes Leu to Tyr (missense mutation).  
   - No premature stop codon is introduced, so the protein is likely still functional.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   `5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’`  
   - The first codon (ATG) remains unchanged.  
   - The second codon (TTT → TTC) is a synonymous mutation (Phe to Phe).  
   - The third codon (CTC → TAA) introduces a premature stop codon (amber stop).  
   - This truncates the protein early, likely rendering it nonfunctional and eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

4. **Mutant 3**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - The first codon (ATG) remains unchanged.  
   - The second codon (TTT → TTT) is unchanged.  
   - The third codon (CTC → TAC) changes Leu to Tyr (missense mutation).  
   - Subsequent codons (GGT → GTC) change Gly to Val (missense mutation).  
   - No premature stop codon is introduced, so the protein is likely still functional.

5. **Mutant 4**:  
   `5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’`  
   - The first codon (ATG) remains unchanged.  
   - The second codon (TTT → TTT) is unchanged.  
   - The third codon (CTC → TAC) changes Leu to Tyr (missense mutation).  
   - The fourth codon (GGT → ACT) changes Gly to Thr (missense mutation).  
   - No premature stop codon is introduced, so the protein is likely still functional.

### Conclusion:
The most effective way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is to disrupt the gene's function. Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (TAA), which truncates the protein and likely renders it nonfunctional. This makes Mutant 2 the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
