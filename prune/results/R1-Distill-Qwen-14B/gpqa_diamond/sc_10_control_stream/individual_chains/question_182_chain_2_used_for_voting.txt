Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. But wait, what's the exact scenario where it applies?

The equation given is J equals (9/8) epsilon mu V squared over L cubed. Right, so J is the dark current, which means it's under conditions where thermal generation of carriers is negligible, like in the dark. The equation is used in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. Oh, right, this happens when the space charge is so large that the electric field is strong enough to dominate the transport of carriers, causing the space charge to limit the current.

So thinking about the conditions under which Mott-Gurney is valid. I remember that it assumes a single type of carrier, so it's for a single-carrier device. That would eliminate any option that talks about two-carrier devices, which probably points to option D being incorrect.

Now, about the contacts. Ohmic contact means that the device doesn't have any barrier for the carriers. So if the device has an Ohmic contact, then the carriers can move easily across the contact without any significant barrier. Alternatively, a Schottky contact would have a barrier, which would affect the current. But wait, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the injection is not a factor, so the contacts are Ohmic. So that would rule out options that mention Schottky contacts.

Wait, the question is about validity. The equation applies when the current is limited by space charge, and under certain conditions. So the main assumptions are: single-carrier, no traps, and the current is limited by space charge. Also, it might depend on whether drift or diffusion dominates. Oh, right, in SCLC, the current is mainly due to the electric field created by the space charge, so drift current is dominant. But if diffusion is significant, that might change things.

Wait, the Mott-Gurney derivation comes from the case where the space charge (electron cloud) creates a potential barrier. So under what conditions? I think that in the Mott-Gurney regime, the current is limited by the space charge, so it's for when there's a trap-free region. Because traps would complicate the movement of carriers, and perhaps lead to a different current dependence.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Trap-free, single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible drift current. Wait, wait. If the drift current is negligible, that doesn't sound right because SCLC is about drift being significant. Or maybe the question is phrased differently. Hmm, no, the equation itself involves the mobility, which is related to drift. So maybe this option is incorrect because if drift is negligible, the equation wouldn't apply.

Wait, the equation includes mu, which is the drift mobility. So for the equation to be valid, drift must be the dominant process. So if the option says "negligible drift current", that would be wrong because drift is the main thing here.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Mott-Gurney equation is for the space-charge-limited current, which is when the current is dominated by the electric field due to the space charge, and carriers are moving primarily by drift, not diffusion. So diffusion isn't the main factor; drift is. So the equation would be valid when diffusion is negligible. Or does it? Because sometimes in device physics, the movement is a combination of drift and diffusion, but under SCLC, maybe drift is the main thing.

Alternatively, perhaps in the Mott-Gurney derivation, it's assumed that the space charge is such that the electric field is strong, leading to drift being dominant. So in that case, the equation would only be valid when drift is the main contributor, and diffusion is negligible.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic contacts), negligible diffusion current. That seems plausible. Because if the contacts are Ohmic, then no barriers, and the equation holds when diffusion is negligible, which is under drift-dominated conditions.

Option C: Single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. But Schottky has a barrier, which probably isn't compatible with the assumption of Ohmic contacts. So that might not be correct.

Option D: Two carriers, so probably not, as we need single-carrier for Mott-Gurney.

So the options boil down to A, B, or C. Let's think carefully.

Option A says negligible drift current. But Mott-Gurney is about drift. So if drift is negligible, this equation wouldn't apply. So option A is wrong.

Option B says no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic), trap-free, and negligible diffusion. That aligns with the conditions: trap-free, single carrier, no injection barriers (Ohmic), and the current is limited by space charge, so the equation would hold when diffusion is negligible (since it's drift dominant).

Option C: Schottky contact. That would imply a barrier, which would affect the current. The Mott-Gurney derivation assumes that the carriers can move freely into the region, so the contacts are Ohmic. So option C is likely incorrect.

So the correct statement must be option B. Because it's a trap-free, single-carrier device, no injection barrier (so Ohmic contacts), and negligible diffusion current (so drift is dominant, which is in line with Mott-Gurney).

The Mott-Gurney equation, which describes the dark current ($J$) versus voltage ($V$) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime, is given by:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the carrier mobility, and $L$ is the device length. This equation is valid under specific conditions:

1. **Single-carrier device**: The equation assumes a single type of carrier (e.g., electrons or holes) and does not account for two-carrier effects. This eliminates options that describe two-carrier devices.

2. **Trap-free region**: The derivation assumes no traps or scattering mechanisms that would otherwise complicate the current transport.

3. **Ohmic contacts**: The equation assumes negligible carrier injection barriers, which implies Ohmic contacts rather than Schottky contacts. This rules out options involving Schottky contacts.

4. **Drift-dominated current**: The Mott-Gurney equation is valid in the SCLC regime, where the current is dominated by drift rather than diffusion. This means diffusion must be negligible for the equation to hold.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States "negligible drift current," which contradicts the drift-dominated nature of the SCLC regime. This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Describes a trap-free, single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.
- **Option C**: Mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a carrier injection barrier. This is inconsistent with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, making this option incorrect.
- **Option D**: Refers to a two-carrier device, which is incompatible with the single-carrier assumption of the Mott-Gurney equation. This option is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option B**, as it accurately describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.
