Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. They’re in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The planets are numbered 1 through 5. They all have the same albedo, so that shouldn't complicate things. We need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, specifically Planet_4 to Planet_2.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I think is something like Te = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ d²) )^0.5 ) ) * ( (1 - albedo)/ (ε) )^0.25, but wait, I might be mixing a few terms.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the inverse square law for radiation. The equilibrium temperature formula is often given as Te = T_effective_of_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. But wait, another way I think is that the temperature depends on the square root of the ratio of the star's luminosity to the planet's distance, adjusted by the albedo. Oh right, the formula is Te = Te_star * sqrt( (L / (16πσ a²) ) ) but considering albedo as (1 - A)/4, but if all have the same albedo, that term cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, maybe the formula is more accurately: Te is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) / (sigma^(1/4) ), but since A is the same for all, we can ignore that. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the star's luminosity over the distance squared, all to the 1/4 power. So Te is proportional to (L / a² )^0.25. But wait, since we're talking about exoplanets around the same star, the L is the same for all. So when taking the ratio, L cancels out.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets would be (a1/a2)^(-0.5), because Te is proportional to (1/a^2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(0.5). So the ratio Te4/Te2 is (a2/a4)^(0.5), assuming all else equal.

Wait, let me think again. Let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4 )

So, since A is the same for all, and L and sigma are constants, the Te is proportional to (1/a²)^(1/4) = 1/a^(0.5). So Te is inversely proportional to the square root of a. So if planet 4 is at a larger a than planet 2, then Te4 will be smaller.

Wait, no, the formula says Te is proportional to (1/a^2)^(1/4) = 1/a^(0.5). So if a increases, Te decreases. So the ratio of Te4 to Te2 is (a2/a4)^0.5.

Wait, so let me get the ratio Te4/Te2 = ( (a2)^(0.5) ) / (a4)^(0.5) ) = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt( (a2)/(a4) )

But wait, I think I might have mixed up the exponents. Let me re-derive it.

The formula:

Te = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4 )

So, Te ∝ (1 / a² )^(1/4 ) => Te ∝ a^(-1/2 )

So, Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio Te4/Te2 would be (a2/a4)^0.5.

Yes, because Te4 = k * a4^(-0.5), Te2 = k * a2^(-0.5). So Te4/Te2 = (a2/a4)^(0.5).

So to find the ratio, I need to find a4 and a2. But wait, the periods are given in a ratio. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So we can assume that their periods are P1, P2=2P1, P3=2.5P1, P4=3.5P1, P5=5P1.

But Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³. So (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3.

Wait, let me write that. From Kepler’s law: a³ ∝ P².

So a4 / a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So the ratio a4/a2 is (3.5 / 2 )^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3).

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, 2 is 2. So P4/P2 = (7/2)/2 = 7/4. So (7/4) is the ratio of periods, P4/P2.

So (a4/a2) = (7/4)^(2/3). Hmm, that's a number. Let me compute that.

Wait, 7/4 is 1.75. So (1.75)^(2/3). Let me think about that.

Alternatively, 7/4 is 343/64 when raised to the 3rd power. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in logarithms.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of exponents.

Let me compute log(7/4) = log(1.75) ≈ 0.2430.

Multiply by 2/3: 0.2430 * (2/3) ≈ 0.162.

So the exponent is about 0.162. So 10^0.162 is about 1.457. Alternatively, e^0.162 is about 1.176. Wait, but wait, actually, since it's (7/4)^(2/3), perhaps it's easier to calculate as:

First, cube root of (7/4)^2.

Compute (7/4) squared is 49/16 = 3.0625. Then take the cube root of that.

What's the cube root of 3.0625? Let's approximate.

1.44³ = approx 1.44 * 1.44 = 2.0736; 2.0736 * 1.44 ≈ 2.985984. Hmm, that's about 2.986, which is less than 3.0625.

1.45³: 1.45 *1.45=2.1025; 2.1025 *1.45≈3.0486.

1.46³: 1.46²=2.1316; 2.1316 *1.46 ≈ 3.114. So 3.114 is larger than 3.0625.

So the cube root of 3.0625 is between 1.45 and 1.46.

Compute 3.0625-3.0486=0.0139. 3.114-3.0625=0.0515.

So, 0.0139 over 0.0515 is about 0.269. So 1.45 + 0.269*(0.01) = approx 1.45269.

So cube root is about 1.4527.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.4527.

Then Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(1/1.4527) ≈ sqrt(0.6883).

What's sqrt(0.6883)? Well, sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85. 0.6883 is between 0.64 and 0.7225.

0.83^2 = 0.6889, which is very close to 0.6883. So sqrt(0.6883) is approximately 0.83.

Wait, 0.83 squared is 0.6889, which is just a tiny bit more than 0.6883. So the square root would be just a bit less than 0.83.

So the ratio Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83. Let me check the options.

The options are:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So the closest is C) ~0.83.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the formula right? Because I've heard that sometimes the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, Kepler's law: a³ ∝ P². So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4 = (P4/P1) * a1. Similarly, a2 = (P2/P1) a1.

So a4 / a2 = (P4/P2) = (3.5 / 2 ) = 1.75.

Wait wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Because earlier I thought a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). But that's not correct. Because Kepler's law says (a1/a2)^3 = (P1/P2)^2. So a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3). So when we have a4 and a2, a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Because a4 = something proportional to P4^(2/3), a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3).

Wait, no, let me get this right.

Let me write Kepler's third law as (a1 / a2)^3 = (P1 / P2)^2. So a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Ah, yes, I was correct earlier. Because a4 is proportional to P4^(2/3) and a2 to P2^(2/3). So a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So (3.5/2) = 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3) is the same as (7/4)^(2/3). Which I calculated as approximately 1.4527.

So a4 is about 1.4527 times a2.

Then the ratio of Te4 to Te2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.4527) ≈ 0.83.

So that would be option C.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculation for (7/4)^(2/3).

Let me compute it another way. Let's compute ln(7/4) = ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596.

Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * (2/3) ≈ 0.373.

Exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.453. So yes, that's correct. So a4/a2 = 1.453.

So Te4/Te2 = sqrt(1 / 1.453) = sqrt(0.688). As I thought earlier, that's about 0.83.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital semi-major axis. Since all planets orbit the same star, the star's luminosity \(L\) and the constant \(\sigma\) cancel out when taking the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}}
\]

From Kepler's third law, \(a^3 \propto P^2\), or equivalently:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \(1:2:2.5:3.5:5\). For Planet_4 and Planet_2, the period ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_4}{P_2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = (1.75)^{2/3}
\]

Approximating \((1.75)^{2/3}\):

\[
\ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596, \quad 0.5596 \times \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.373, \quad e^{0.373} \approx 1.453
\]

So:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.453
\]

Now, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.453}} \approx \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \(0.83\), corresponding to option C.

But wait, I think I might have mixed up the exponents. Let me re-derive it.

The formula:

Te = [ (L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4 )

So, Te ∝ (1 / a² )^(1/4 ) => Te ∝ a^(-1/2 )

So, Te is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio Te4/Te2 would be (a2/a4)^0.5.

Yes, because Te4 = k * a4^(-0.5), Te2 = k * a2^(-0.5). So Te4/Te2 = (a2/a4)^(0.5).

So to find the ratio, I need to find a4 and a2. But wait, the periods are given in a ratio. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So we can assume that their periods are P1, P2=2P1, P3=2.5P1, P4=3.5P1, P5=5P1.

But Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³. So (P4/P2)^2 = (a4/a2)^3.

Wait, let me write that. From Kepler’s law: a³ ∝ P².

So a4 / a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So the ratio a4/a2 is (3.5 / 2 )^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3).

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, 2 is 2. So P4/P2 = (7/2)/2 = 7/4. So (7/4) is the ratio of periods, P4/P2.

So (a4/a2) = (7/4)^(2/3). Hmm, that's a number. Let me compute that.

Wait, 7/4 is 1.75. So (1.75)^(2/3). Let me think about that.

Alternatively, 7/4 is 343/64 when raised to the 3rd power. Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in logarithms.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of exponents.

Let me compute log(7/4) = log(1.75) ≈ 0.2430.

Multiply by 2/3: 0.2430 * (2/3) ≈ 0.162.

So the exponent is about 0.162. So 10^0.162 is about 1.457. Alternatively, e^0.162 is about 1.176. Wait, but wait, actually, since it's (7/4)^(2/3), perhaps it's easier to calculate as:

First, cube root of (7/4)^2.

Compute (7/4) squared is 49/16 = 3.0625. Then take the cube root of that.

What's the cube root of 3.0625? Let's approximate.

1.44³ = approx 1.44 * 1.44 = 2.0736; 2.0736 * 1.44 ≈ 2.985984. Hmm, that's about 2.986, which is less than 3.0625.

1.45³: 1.45 *1.45=2.1025; 2.1025 *1.45≈3.0486.

1.46³: 1.46²=2.1316; 2.1316 *1.46 ≈ 3.114. So 3.114 is larger than 3.0625.

So the cube root of 3.0625 is between 1.45 and 1.46.

Compute 3.0625-3.0486=0.0139. 3.114-3.0625=0.0515.

So, 0.0139 over 0.0515 is about 0.269. So 1.45 + 0.269*(0.01) = approx 1.45269.

So cube root is about 1.4527.

So a4/a2 ≈ 1.4527.

Then Te4/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a4 ) = sqrt(1/1.4527) ≈ sqrt(0.6883).

What's sqrt(0.6883)? Well, sqrt(0.64) is 0.8, sqrt(0.7225) is 0.85. 0.6883 is between 0.64 and 0.7225.

0.83^2 = 0.6889, which is very close to 0.6883. So sqrt(0.6883) is approximately 0.83.

Wait, 0.83 squared is 0.6889, which is just a tiny bit more than 0.6883. So the square root would be just a bit less than 0.83.

So the ratio Te4/Te2 is approximately 0.83. Let me check the options.

The options are:

A) ~0.57

B) ~0.69

C) ~0.83

D) ~0.75

So the closest is C) ~0.83.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the formula right? Because I've heard that sometimes the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the period, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, Kepler's law: a³ ∝ P². So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So a4 = (P4/P1) * a1. Similarly, a2 = (P2/P1) a1.

So a4 / a2 = (P4/P2) = (3.5 / 2 ) = 1.75.

Wait wait, that's different from what I had earlier. Because earlier I thought a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). But that's not correct. Because Kepler's law says (a1/a2)^3 = (P1/P2)^2. So a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3). So when we have a4 and a2, a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). Because a4 = something proportional to P4^(2/3), a2 is proportional to P2^(2/3).

Wait, no, let me get this right.

Let me write Kepler's third law as (a1 / a2)^3 = (P1 / P2)^2. So a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3). So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Ah, yes, I was correct earlier. Because a4 is proportional to P4^(2/3) and a2 to P2^(2/3). So a4/a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So (3.5/2) = 1.75.

So (1.75)^(2/3) is the same as (7/4)^(2/3). Which I calculated as approximately 1.4527.

So a4 is about 1.4527 times a2.

Then the ratio of Te4 to Te2 is sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(1/1.4527) ≈ 0.83.

So that would be option C.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculation for (7/4)^(2/3).

Let me compute it another way. Let's compute ln(7/4) = ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596.

Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * (2/3) ≈ 0.373.

Exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.453. So yes, that's correct. So a4/a2 = 1.453.

So Te4/Te2 = sqrt(1 / 1.453) = sqrt(0.688). As I thought earlier, that's about 0.83.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_e \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital semi-major axis. Since all planets orbit the same star, the star's luminosity \(L\) and the constant \(\sigma\) cancel out when taking the ratio. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}}
\]

From Kepler's third law, \(a^3 \propto P^2\), or equivalently:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

The orbital periods of the planets are given in the ratio \(1:2:2.5:3.5:5\). For Planet_4 and Planet_2, the period ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_4}{P_2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = (1.75)^{2/3}
\]

Approximating \((1.75)^{2/3}\):

\[
\ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596, \quad 0.5596 \times \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.373, \quad e^{0.373} \approx 1.453
\]

So:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.453
\]

Now, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_{e4}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.453}} \approx \sqrt{0.688} \approx 0.83
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \(0.83\), corresponding to option C.

Answer: C
