Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about two reactions and the products formed. Then, those products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The task is to find out how many peaks appear in each chromatogram.

First, let's look at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It's treated with LAH, which is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. Then there's an acidic workup.

I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent. It reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, right? So, the 3-ketone group in hexan-3-one would become a 3-hydroxyl group. So, the product after Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but when you reduce a ketone, the configurationâ€”wait, the starting material is a chiral center at the 5-position because of the methoxy group. Oh, but wait, the ketone is at C3, so when reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the configuration at C3 depends on the starting material. The starting material is (S) configuration at C5. Wait, but the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol would create a new chiral center. Because the ketone is (R) or (S)? Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Or wait, wait, maybe it's (S) configuration at C5. Let me think. The structure is:

The molecule is hexan-3-one with a methoxy group on C5. So, the structure would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, wait, that can't be right because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's (5-methoxyhexan-3-one) is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO, so positions 1-6: 1, 2, 3 (CO), 4,5,6. So 5-methoxy would be on the 5th carbon. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OMe? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw this:

Carbon chain: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

At C3 is the ketone (O). At C5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, the chain from C3 would be CO connected to C2 and C4. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the molecule: 

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's 6 carbons in total? Let me count: CO is at C3, so carbons are 1,2,3 (CO), 4,5,6. So, 5-methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure is: 

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH3? Wait, no, because hexan-3-one is six carbons with ketone on C3. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait that's seven carbons. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I don't need to know the exact structure. The key point is that the starting material is a ketone with a methoxy group on C5, and it's S configuration.

When LAH reduces the ketone, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a CH-OH group. So, the product will be a secondary alcohol.

So, Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. When we reduce the ketone, a new chiral center is formed at C3. The ketone was (R) or (S) configuration? Wait, the starting material's configuration is S at C5. But the ketone is at C3. So, when we reduce C3, the OH group will be added. Since the ketone is planar, the attack by the hydride could be from either face, but in a chiral environment, will the configuration be determined?

Wait, no, the ketone is transformed into an alcohol, and the configuration at the new center (C3) would depend on the reaction conditions. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to the most stable alcohol. Wait, but in the case of a symmetric ketone, you get a racemic mixture, but in this case, the ketone is asymmetric because C3 is connected to two different groups: a CH2 on one side and a CH2-CH(OCH3) on the other. So the reduction would create a new chiral center.

Wait, the original compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The configuration at C5 is S. So when the ketone at C3 is reduced, the product will have a new chiral center at C3. The configuration of C3 will be determined by the mechanism. LAH is a strong reducing agent, so it's a two-step process: the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen becomes an -OH group after the acidic workup.

Wait, perhaps the configuration of the new OH group depends on where the hydride attack occurred. Since the starting ketone is (S) at C5, would that influence the configuration at C3? Hmm, not directly. The attack of the hydride would be from the less hindered side. But perhaps in this case, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the reduction would lead to a specific configuration at C3. Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a specific configuration based on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting too bogged down. Let's think of the product: After LAH reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is S configuration at C5, and the product will have a new chiral center at C3. So the product will have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So, the product will have two stereocenters. How many stereoisomers are possible here?

At C3, the groups would be: -CH2-OH, -CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, maybe not. Wait, maybe the groups around C3 are:

- CH2CH2 (from C2)

- CO (now CH2OH after reduction)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, and since the starting material was a single enantiomer (S at C5), the product would have a specific configuration at C3. So, the product is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers. Therefore, it would have two stereoisomers possible, but since the reaction is done under specific conditions, perhaps only one is formed.

Wait, but no, the starting material is S configuration at C5. The reduction at C3 would produce a new chiral center. The product will have both C3 and C5 as chiral centers. So, if the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product will have two stereocenters, and thus four possible stereoisomers. But wait, no, because the reduction at C3 would produce a new stereocenter, but perhaps only one stereoisomer is formed. Hmm, I'm not sure, but maybe the product is a racemic mixture? No, because LAH typically leads to the formation of a single enantiomer due to the hydride attack from a specific face, especially in a chiral environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol with a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single stereoisomer. Wait, maybe the product is a single diastereomer, but this is getting complicated. Let me proceed.

Moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH2. So, it's a diketone: O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, let me count. Pentane has five carbons. So 2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would be six carbons. No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think: positions 2 and 4 are ketones. So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's four carbons between the two ketones? No, 2 and 4 on a five-carbon chain.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, that can't be right because that would be four carbons with ketones at 2 and 4. Wait, no. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3

So, the structure is (CH3)2C=O-CH2-C(=O)CH3? Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. But that's five carbons. Wait, maybe it's:

(CH3)CO-CH2-CO-CH3. No, that's five carbons. So, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, that would be five carbons but the ketones are at 2 and 4. So, the structure is:

O
||
CH2-C-O
|    |
CH2  CH2

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons, with ketones on C2 and C4. So, the structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2(CO)CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the structure O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Now, when this is treated with NaBH4, which is a reducing agent. NaBH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Since there are two ketone groups, each will be reduced.

So, each ketone becomes a CH(OH) group. So, the product would be HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait.

Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione: O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Hmm, maybe it's (CH3)C=O-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, that would be four carbons. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, which is five carbons with ketones on C2 and C4.

So, when treated with excess NaBH4, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. So, each O becomes an OH group. So, the product would be HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons, with OH groups on C2 and C4. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione after reduction becomes 2,4-pentanediol. So the structure is HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric. So, each ketone is on C2 and C4. So, when reduced, each becomes an alcohol. So, the product would be (2R,4R), (2S,4S), (2R,4S), and (2S,4R) configurations? Because each reduction leads to a new chiral center. Since the starting material is symmetric, the product would form a racemic mixture. Wait, but it's being treated with excess NaBH4. How does that affect the outcome?

Wait, NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but it's used in a solvent like methanol or THF. The reduction of a diketone with two ketone groups would reduce both to secondary alcohols. So, for each ketone, the NaBH4 would add the hydride. The question is whether the reduction leads to a specific configuration or a racemic mixture.

In the case of a symmetric diketone like pentane-2,4-dione, the two ketone groups are on symmetric positions. So, when each is reduced, the two new OH groups can be either both R, both S, or one R and one S. But wait, if the starting material is symmetric, perhaps the product would form a pair of enantiomers, but in equal amounts. So, the product would be a racemic mixture of 2,4-pentanediol with configurations (2R,4R) and (2S,4S). Wait, because the molecule is symmetric, I think that the product would be a single diastereomer. No, wait. Let me think again.

Each ketone is reduced independently. Each reduction of a ketone with NaBH4 (a non-chiral reducing agent) would typically give a racemic mixture. However, in a symmetric molecule, the two reductions could lead to a single product. For example, if both ketones are reduced to the same configuration, the molecule would be meso. Because the starting material is symmetric, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, the meso compound.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric. So, when each ketone is reduced, the product would have two OH groups. Due to the symmetry, if the two OHs are on the same side, you get (R,R) and (S,S), which are enantiomers. But because the molecule is symmetric, the (R,R) and (S,S) configurations would actually be the same as each other due to a plane of symmetry. No, that's not correct. Wait, the molecule is symmetric, so if both OHs are R, that's one configuration, and both S is another. But the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4, so (R,R) is the same as (S,S) because of the symmetry. So, the product would be a meso compound, a single stereoisomer. Wait, but no, because the molecule is symmetric, the (R,S) configuration would be superimposable on itself, leading to a meso form. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think: the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait. Let me structure it correctly.

The product after reduction is HOCH2-CHOH-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let's properly structure pentane-2,4-dione. It's:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be four carbons with two ketones. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Let me think again. The formula for pentane-2,4-dione is C5H8O2. The structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, that's five carbons, but that would be 2,4-dio in pentane. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, wait, that's four carbons in the chain. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact structure.

In any case, the product of Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which has two OH groups. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product would be a meso compound. So, 2,4-pentanediol would be a single stereoisomer, the meso form. Because the two OHs are on symmetric positions, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, despite having two stereocenters, the compound is meso and thus not chiral. Therefore, Reaction II produces a single product: meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait. How does NaBH4 affect the stereochemistry here? NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, it's not. So, when each ketone is reduced, each would form a racemic mixture. But in the case of a symmetric diketone, the combination of the two would lead to a meso compound as the major product. Because the two new OH groups can be both R, both S, or opposite. But due to the symmetry, the (R,S) and (S,R) configurations are the same as each other, leading to a single meso product.

But wait, when reducing each ketone, since the starting material is symmetrical, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer. So, 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so it's not chiral. Therefore, Reaction II gives a single product, meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Now, after both reactions are complete, the products are combined. So, what are the products?

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a secondary alcohol with two chiral centers: C3 (new) and C5 (original). So, the product has two stereocenters. Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone is reduced, a new chiral center is formed at C3. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with chiral centers at C3 and C5. How many stereoisomers can this have? Well, each center can be R or S, but the starting material is a specific enantiomer. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single stereoisomer because the hydride attack is from a specific face. So, the product is a single diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single compound with a specific configuration at C3 and C5. So, two chiral centers, leading to two stereoisomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but let's think: the starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced, the hydride attack could be from the same face or the opposite face, leading to different configurations at C3. But in a chiral environment, would that lead to a specific configuration?

I think that the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, with two chiral centers. So, it's one stereoisomer.

Reaction II gives a single product (a meso compound), which is not chiral.

So, when the products are combined, what do we have?

Product from Reaction I: one stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Product from Reaction II: one stereoisomer, which is a meso compound, so not chiral.

So, in total, we have two different products: product A (from Reaction I: one stereoisomer) and product B (from Reaction II: one stereoisomer, meso, so no chiral centers).

Now, when running these on an HPLC column, the type of column determines the separation based on the structure. A normal-phase HPLC column separates based on polarity, while a chiral column separates based on the presence and configuration of chiral centers.

So, for the normal-phase HPLC:

Product A is a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group. It's a polar molecule because of the OH and OMe groups. Product B is a diol, which is also polar. But wait, let's think about their structures.

Wait, product A is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It's a six-carbon alcohol with a methoxy group at C5 and an OH at C3. Product B is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a five-carbon molecule with two OH groups.

In normal-phase HPLC, the separation is based on the polarity of the molecules. More polar compounds elute later (retained longer) than less polar ones. So, the two products would have different polarities. Product B is more polar because it has two OH groups compared to product A, which has one OH and a methoxy group. So, in normal-phase HPLC, they would appear as two separate peaks. So, two peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other products? No, because each reaction produces one product each. So, two products in total, leading to two peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Now, the chiral HPLC column. Chiral columns separate enantiomers and diastereomers. So, product A has two chiral centers. How many stereoisomers does it have? For two chiral centers, maximum four stereoisomers (two enantiomeric pairs). But in this case, product A is a single stereoisomer because it's formed from a single enantiomer starting material and a specific reduction. So, product A is a single stereoisomer.

Product B is a meso compound, so it's not chiral. It doesn't have any chiral centers, so it won't interact with the chiral HPLC column in a way that causes separation. So, in the chiral HPLC, product B would elute as a single peak because it's not chiral.

Product A, being a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, would also elute as a single peak because it's not part of a pair of enantiomers? Wait, no. Wait, a single stereoisomer would have a certain configuration, and it would be a single peak. So, product A is a single stereoisomer, so it would give one peak, and product B, being a meso compound, would also give one peak. So, in total, two peaks in the chiral HPLC.

Wait, that would mean two peaks in both HPLC columns, but none of the options match that. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Hmm, none of the options have two peaks in both. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let's reconsider Reaction I. The product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Does this molecule have any other stereocenters? If so, how many?

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So, product A has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. Let's think about whether these are both present and whether they're in a configuration that creates multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. So, the rest of the molecule's configuration is set. When LAH reduces the ketone at C3, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which would have specific configurations at both C3 and C5. So, it's a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Then, Reaction II gives a meso compound, so no chiral centers.

So, when combined, the two products are:

1. A single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

2. A meso compound with two chiral centers (but not chiral overall).

Wait, wait. The meso compound has two chiral centers but is achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry. So, product B is a meso compound and therefore will not show any chiral behavior.

Now, in the normal-phase HPLC, the two products are non-chiral but structurally different. So, they would each elute as separate peaks. So, two peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer, so it would elute as one peak. Product B is a meso compound, which is not chiral, so it would also elute as a single peak. So, two peaks in total in the chiral column.

Wait, but the options don't have two peaks in either. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction I. Maybe the product of Reaction I has more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When the ketone is reduced, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. How many chiral centers are present?

The starting material has a chiral center at C5. After reduction, the product will have a chiral center at C3. So, product A has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Now, how many stereoisomers are possible for product A? For two stereocenters, there are 2^2 =4 possible stereoisomers. But if the molecule has any symmetry, some of these may be identical.

Wait, considering product A: if the molecule is such that swapping C3 and C5 would result in the same molecule, but I don't think so. So, the product would have four possible stereoisomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps only two are formed.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced, the new chiral center at C3 could be R or S. But under the conditions of LAH reduction, which is a strong, bulky reducing agent, the approach of the hydride would determine the configuration at C3.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a specific configuration at C3. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the attack of the hydride would be from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration at C3. So, the product would be a single stereoisomer with configurations at C3 and C5.

So, product A is a single stereoisomer, product B is a meso compound. So, in the combined mixture, there are two compounds: one with two stereocenters (but a single stereoisomer) and one meso.

In the normal-phase HPLC, these would separate into two peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, the first product (with two stereocenters) is a single stereoisomer, so it would elute as one peak. The second product (meso) is not chiral, so it would also elute as one peak. So, two peaks in total.

But none of the options say two peaks in both. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers. How?

If the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3. No, because the starting material is chiral and the reaction is stereoselective. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and it typically leads to the formation of a single enantiomer because the hydride attacks from the less hindered face.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer. So, product A is one stereoisomer. So, in the chiral HPLC, it would be a single peak. Product B is the meso compound, a single peak. So, two peaks in the chiral HPLC.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the products.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, not a single stereoisomer. Let's think again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. On reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The molecule has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

The configuration at C5 is S (from the starting material), and the configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction.

In the reduction, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. So, if the starting material is (S) at C5, the hydride would attack from a specific face, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

So, the product has a specific configuration at C3, leading to a specific stereoisomer. So, product A is a single stereoisomer.

Product B is a meso compound, so no chiral centers, so a single peak.

So, in chiral HPLC, two peaks. In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some products. Let me think again.

Reaction I: Starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After LAH reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, a secondary alcohol. So, that's one product.

Reaction II: Starting with pentane-2,4-dione. After NaBH4 reduction, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So, one product.

Combined, two products. So, in total, two compounds.

In normal-phase HPLC, these two would be separated into two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer (two chiral centers, but a single configuration), so one peak. Product B is a meso compound, so it doesn't have any chiral centers and would elute as a single peak. So, two peaks in total.

But the options don't have two peaks in both. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a mixture of diastereomers. Let me think again about the reduction. If the ketone is at C3 and the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5, could the reduction lead to multiple stereoisomers at C3?

In the case of a cyclic ketone, the reduction could lead to axial vs equatorial attack, but in this case, it's a straight-chain ketone. So, the hydride would attack from the less hindered face. The starting material's configuration at C5 may influence which face is more hindered.

Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So, the groups around C5 are arranged such that the methoxy group is in a specific position. When looking at the ketone at C3, the adjacent groups would influence where the hydride attacks.

So, when the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, it can approach from either the top or bottom face. The configuration of C5 might influence which face is more accessible.

Assuming that the hydride approaches from the less hindered face, the configuration at C3 would be determined, leading to a single stereoisomer.

So, product A is a single stereoisomer, product B is a meso compound.

Thus, in both HPLC columns, two peaks each. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction II. Let me think again.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. So, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol.

The product is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, the question is whether this product is a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

In the case of a symmetric molecule like 2,4-pentanediol, if the two OH groups are on opposite sides due to the reduction, the molecule would be meso.

Wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. After reduction, it becomes HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me structure it properly. The correct structure of pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

No, that's not right. Let me correct this. The correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons, but the ketone groups are at C2 and C4. So, the structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2(CO)CH2CH3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I can proceed.

When NaBH4 reduces each ketone, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. The structure would be HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Now, considering the stereochemistry:

Each OH group can be R or S. Since the starting material is symmetric, the two OH groups can be both R, both S, or opposite.

But when the starting material is symmetric, the product would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, the product is a meso compound, which is not chiral.

So, product B is meso-2,4-pentanediol, a single stereoisomer.

So, the combined products are:

- Product A: a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

- Product B: a single meso compound with two chiral centers but not chiral.

So, in the normal-phase HPLC, two different structures, so two peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer (so one peak), product B is a meso compound (so one peak). So, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is actually a pair of enantiomers. Or maybe more than one product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, it becomes 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

The configuration at C5 is S. The configuration at C3 depends on the reduction. Let's say the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3, making a single stereoisomer, so product A is a single stereoisomer.

Thus, when combined with product B (meso), the mixture has two compounds, leading to two peaks in both HPLC columns.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the number of stereocenters in product A. Let me count again.

Product A: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Chiral centers at C3 and C5.

So, two chiral centers. So, four possible stereoisomers. But if the product is formed from a single enantiomer starting material and the reduction is stereoselective, the product would be a single stereoisomer.

So, product A is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Thus, in chiral HPLC, product A is a single peak, product B is a single peak. Total two peaks.

In normal-phase, two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has more than one stereoisomer. Let me think.

Wait, when the ketone is reduced, the product can form either R or S configuration at C3. But because the starting material is chiral, perhaps the reduction leads to both configurations, but in a specific ratio.

Wait, no. The starting material's configuration at C5 would influence the approach of the hydride. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single stereoisomer.

So, product A is a single stereoisomer.

Thus, I'm confident that in the chiral HPLC, there are two peaks, and in the normal-phase, two peaks. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I. Let me consider the structure again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a new chiral center at C3, but C5 is not a chiral center anymore? Or is it?

Wait, in the starting material, C5 has a methoxy group and two CH2 groups. So, it's a chiral center.

After reduction, C3 becomes a chiral center with OH, and C5 remains a chiral center with OMe.

So, product A has two chiral centers.

Thus, product A is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the normal-phase HPLC would separate based on the structure, but perhaps there's more than two products.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the possibility that Reaction I forms multiple products.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but in Reaction I, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would be a single stereoisomer.

So, product A is one compound, product B is another. Thus, total two compounds. So, two peaks in each HPLC.

But the options don't include this. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the starting material in Reaction I has a different structure. Let me think again.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Upon reduction, becomes CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

So, two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Thus, product A is a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II gives meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound.

Thus, two compounds in total.

So, the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC would be two, and in chiral HPLC, two.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the chiral HPLC. If product A is a diastereomer in some way, maybe it would cause more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps product A is a pair of enantiomers because the two chiral centers could form a pair that is chiral.

But no, product A is a single stereoisomer. So, it would be a single peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options.

Option B says 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Hmm. Where would three peaks come from?

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think again. Maybe the reduction of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one leads to more than one product because of some other factor.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to more than one stereoisomer. For example, if the reduction isn't stereoselective, leading to a mix, but that's unlikely with LAH, which is known for stereoselective reductions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a single enantiomer, but the question states it is (S)-configuration.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the possible answers.

If the answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal.

So, perhaps in the chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer (1 peak), product B is a meso (1 peak), and something else (1 peak). But I don't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, leading to two stereoisomers, each of which would be separated by the chiral column. But I thought that LAH leads to a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the product from Reaction I.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces a pair of enantiomers. Let me think: the starting material is (S) at C5. Upon reduction, the product has a new chiral center at C3. Depending on the configuration, it could lead to four possible stereoisomers. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would be a pair of enantiomers?

Wait, no. Because the starting material is (S) at C5, the configuration at C3 would be determined by the hydride attack. So, the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think of the answer options again.

Option D: 3 peaks in both HPLC.

Wait, perhaps product A has two stereoisomers, product B has one, and something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction II.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione + excess NaBH4.

Wait, NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones, but in the case of a diketone, perhaps it reduces both ketones. So, product is 2,4-pentanediol.

But perhaps the product has four stereoisomers, but because the starting material is symmetric, it's a meso compound.

So, product B is a single compound.

Thus, in the chiral HPLC, product A (single) and product B (single) give two peaks.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product A having two chiral centers.

Wait, product A is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's see if any of the carbons are not chiral.

At C3: attached groups are CH2CH2 (from C2), CH(OH) (C3), CH2 (C4), and CH(OCH3)CH2CH3 (C5). So, four different groups: -CH2-, -OH, -CH2-, and a more complex group. So, C3 is a chiral center.

At C5: attached groups are OMe, two CH2 groups, and a CH2 group from C4. So, wait, the groups at C5 are:

- OCH3,

- CH2CH2 (C4),

- CH2 (from C6),

- and the CH2 group from C4 again?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the structure after reduction is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, maybe it's (CH2)2-CHOH-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons. C1: CH3, C2: CH2, C3: C(OH), C4: CH2, C5: CH(OCH3), C6: CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct the structure.

Wait, the starting material was 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

After reduction, it becomes:

CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

So, at C3: groups are CH2CH2, CH(OH), CH2, and a CH2 group from the next carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The structure after reduction would have:

- C1: CH3,

- C2: CH2,

- C3: CH(OH),

- C4: CH2,

- C5: CH(OCH3),

- C6: CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The structure after reduction would be:

CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3.

So, the molecule is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

So, C3 has the groups:

- CH2CH3 (from C2),

- OH,

- CH2 (from C4),

- and CH(OCH3)CH2CH3 (from C5? No, wait, C5 is the next carbon after C4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but the key point is that C3 and C5 are both chiral centers.

Thus, product A has two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps only two stereoisomers are formed.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction at C3 would create a new chiral center. Depending on the approach of the hydride, the configuration at C3 would be determined. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3 and C5, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Thus, product A is a single stereoisomer.

So, in the chiral HPLC:

- Product A: 1 peak.

- Product B: 1 peak.

Total: 2 peaks.

In normal-phase HPLC:

- Product A and B: 2 peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of peaks in the chiral HPLC. Let me think.

In the chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer, so one peak. Product B is a meso compound, so it doesn't have any chiral centers and would elute as a single peak. So, two peaks.

In the normal-phase HPLC, two different compounds, so two peaks.

Thus, the answer should be two peaks in both, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product B. Let me think again.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione + excess NaBH4.

The product is 2,4-pentanediol. Which is a meso compound, so it's a single stereoisomer.

But wait, NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but perhaps in the presence of excess, it leads to complete reduction, but maybe the stereochemistry is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps the product is a pair of enantiomers. Let me think: if the two OH groups are on the same side, the molecule would be chiral, but if they are opposite, it's meso.

But for a symmetric starting material, the product would be a meso compound.

Thus, product B is a single stereoisomer (meso), so one peak in chiral HPLC.

Product A is a single stereoisomer, one peak.

Thus, in chiral HPLC, two peaks.

In normal-phase, two peaks.

So, again, the answer isn't matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I, and product A has more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, but the starting material's configuration at C5 might influence that.

Wait, no. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Thus, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the product from Reaction I has two stereocenters, and the product from Reaction II has two as well but as a meso, leading to more peaks.

Wait, product B is a meso, so it doesn't contribute to the chiral HPLC peaks. Product A has two chiral centers, so one peak in chiral HPLC. So, two peaks in chiral HPLC.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The closest option that makes sense is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. But I can't see how there would be three peaks.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction I. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Product A: two chiral centers, so four possible stereoisomers. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Thus, product A is one stereoisomer.

Product B: meso, so one stereoisomer.

Thus, in the chiral HPLC, two peaks.

In the normal-phase, two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a single enantiomer but a racemic mixture. But the question states it's (S), so it's a single enantiomer.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

But I can't figure out why. Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC, and product B is a meso, leading to a third peak. But that doesn't make sense because product B isn't chiral.

I'm stuck, but based on my analysis, I think the correct answer is two peaks in both HPLC, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Rechecking the problem statement.

Wait, the question says after 100% completion, the products are combined and run on both columns.

Perhaps the products from each reaction are more than one. Let me think.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione â†’ reduced to 2,4-pentanediol (meso). So, one product.

Thus, two products in total.

In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two stereoisomers. Let me think: perhaps the reduction of the ketone leads to a racemic mixture at C3, but the starting material's configuration at C5 doesn't influence it. But that's unlikely because the starting material is chiral and the reaction is stereoselective.

Thus, I think the correct answer isn't present, but perhaps the intended answer is option B: 3 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps product A is a diastereomer which splits into two peaks in the chiral HPLC, but I can't see why.

I'm going to go with option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC columns.

### Reaction I:
The starting material is **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**, a chiral ketone. When treated with LAH (a strong reducing agent), the ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, forming **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. This product has two chiral centers: C3 (newly formed) and C5 (retained from the starting material). Since the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reduction is stereoselective, the product is a single stereoisomer with specific configurations at both chiral centers.

### Reaction II:
The starting material is **pentane-2,4-dione**, a symmetric diketone. When treated with excess NaBH4, both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming **2,4-pentanediol**. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product is a **meso compound**, which is achiral despite having two chiral centers. Thus, Reaction II produces a single, non-chiral product.

### Combined Products:
After the reactions, the products are combined:
1. **Product A**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single stereoisomer with two chiral centers).
2. **Product B**: meso-2,4-pentanediol (achiral, single compound).

### Analysis of HPLC Results:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**: Separates based on polarity.  
   - Product A is a polar molecule with two chiral centers.  
   - Product B is also polar but achiral.  
   - Since the two products are structurally distinct, they will elute as **two separate peaks**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**: Separates based on chirality.  
   - Product A, being a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, will elute as **one peak**.  
   - Product B, being a meso compound (achiral), will elute as **one peak**.  
   - Total: **two peaks** in the chiral HPLC.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two products are formed, so this is not possible.  

- **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both HPLC columns.  

- **Option C**: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both HPLC columns.  

- **Option D**: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both HPLC columns.  

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the correct answer should be **two peaks in both HPLC columns**. However, none of the provided options match this result. Given the structure of the question and the available options, **Option B** is the closest match, likely due to an oversight in the problem setup or interpretation.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about two reactions and the products formed. Then, those products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The task is to find out how many peaks appear in each chromatogram.

First, let's look at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. It's treated with LAH, which is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. Then there's an acidic workup.

I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent. It reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, right? So, the 3-ketone group in hexan-3-one would become a 3-hydroxyl group. So, the product after Reaction I should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but when you reduce a ketone, the configurationâ€”wait, the starting material is a chiral center at the 5-position because of the methoxy group. Oh, but wait, the ketone is at C3, so when reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the configuration at C3 depends on the starting material. The starting material is (S) configuration at C5. Wait, but the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol would create a new chiral center. Because the ketone is (R) or (S)? Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Or wait, wait, maybe it's (S) configuration at C5. Let me think. The structure is:

The molecule is hexan-3-one with a methoxy group on C5. So, the structure would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, wait, that can't be right because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's (5-methoxyhexan-3-one) is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH(OCH3)CH3? Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO, so positions 1-6: 1, 2, 3 (CO), 4,5,6. So 5-methoxy would be on the 5th carbon. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OMe? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw this:

Carbon chain: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

At C3 is the ketone (O). At C5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, the chain from C3 would be CO connected to C2 and C4. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the molecule: 

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's 6 carbons in total? Let me count: CO is at C3, so carbons are 1,2,3 (CO), 4,5,6. So, 5-methoxy is on carbon 5. So the structure is: 

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: CH2

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)

Carbon 6: CH3? Wait, no, because hexan-3-one is six carbons with ketone on C3. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait that's seven carbons. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I don't need to know the exact structure. The key point is that the starting material is a ketone with a methoxy group on C5, and it's S configuration.

When LAH reduces the ketone, the carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a CH-OH group. So, the product will be a secondary alcohol.

So, Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. When we reduce the ketone, a new chiral center is formed at C3. The ketone was (R) or (S) configuration? Wait, the starting material's configuration is S at C5. But the ketone is at C3. So, when we reduce C3, the OH group will be added. Since the ketone is planar, the attack by the hydride could be from either face, but in a chiral environment, will the configuration be determined?

Wait, no, the ketone is transformed into an alcohol, and the configuration at the new center (C3) would depend on the reaction conditions. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to the most stable alcohol. Wait, but in the case of a symmetric ketone, you get a racemic mixture, but in this case, the ketone is asymmetric because C3 is connected to two different groups: a CH2 on one side and a CH2-CH(OCH3) on the other. So the reduction would create a new chiral center.

Wait, the original compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The configuration at C5 is S. So when the ketone at C3 is reduced, the product will have a new chiral center at C3. The configuration of C3 will be determined by the mechanism. LAH is a strong reducing agent, so it's a two-step process: the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen becomes an -OH group after the acidic workup.

Wait, perhaps the configuration of the new OH group depends on where the hydride attack occurred. Since the starting ketone is (S) at C5, would that influence the configuration at C3? Hmm, not directly. The attack of the hydride would be from the less hindered side. But perhaps in this case, since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the reduction would lead to a specific configuration at C3. Alternatively, perhaps the product would have a specific configuration based on the structure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting too bogged down. Let's think of the product: After LAH reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is S configuration at C5, and the product will have a new chiral center at C3. So the product will have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So, the product will have two stereocenters. How many stereoisomers are possible here?

At C3, the groups would be: -CH2-OH, -CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, maybe not. Wait, maybe the groups around C3 are:

- CH2CH2 (from C2)

- CO (now CH2OH after reduction)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, and since the starting material was a single enantiomer (S at C5), the product would have a specific configuration at C3. So, the product is a single enantiomer with two chiral centers. Therefore, it would have two stereoisomers possible, but since the reaction is done under specific conditions, perhaps only one is formed.

Wait, but no, the starting material is S configuration at C5. The reduction at C3 would produce a new chiral center. The product will have both C3 and C5 as chiral centers. So, if the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product will have two stereocenters, and thus four possible stereoisomers. But wait, no, because the reduction at C3 would produce a new stereocenter, but perhaps only one stereoisomer is formed. Hmm, I'm not sure, but maybe the product is a racemic mixture? No, because LAH typically leads to the formation of a single enantiomer due to the hydride attack from a specific face, especially in a chiral environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol with a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single stereoisomer. Wait, maybe the product is a single diastereomer, but this is getting complicated. Let me proceed.

Moving on to Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3C(O))2CH2. So, it's a diketone: O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, let me count. Pentane has five carbons. So 2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would be six carbons. No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think: positions 2 and 4 are ketones. So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's four carbons between the two ketones? No, 2 and 4 on a five-carbon chain.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, that can't be right because that would be four carbons with ketones at 2 and 4. Wait, no. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3

So, the structure is (CH3)2C=O-CH2-C(=O)CH3? Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. But that's five carbons. Wait, maybe it's:

(CH3)CO-CH2-CO-CH3. No, that's five carbons. So, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, that would be five carbons but the ketones are at 2 and 4. So, the structure is:

O
||
CH2-C-O
|    |
CH2  CH2

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons, with ketones on C2 and C4. So, the structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2(CO)CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the structure O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Now, when this is treated with NaBH4, which is a reducing agent. NaBH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Since there are two ketone groups, each will be reduced.

So, each ketone becomes a CH(OH) group. So, the product would be HOCH2-CHOH-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait.

Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione: O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, wait, that's six carbons. Hmm, maybe it's (CH3)C=O-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, that would be four carbons. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3, which is five carbons with ketones on C2 and C4.

So, when treated with excess NaBH4, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. So, each O becomes an OH group. So, the product would be HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons, with OH groups on C2 and C4. So, the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione after reduction becomes 2,4-pentanediol. So the structure is HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric. So, each ketone is on C2 and C4. So, when reduced, each becomes an alcohol. So, the product would be (2R,4R), (2S,4S), (2R,4S), and (2S,4R) configurations? Because each reduction leads to a new chiral center. Since the starting material is symmetric, the product would form a racemic mixture. Wait, but it's being treated with excess NaBH4. How does that affect the outcome?

Wait, NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but it's used in a solvent like methanol or THF. The reduction of a diketone with two ketone groups would reduce both to secondary alcohols. So, for each ketone, the NaBH4 would add the hydride. The question is whether the reduction leads to a specific configuration or a racemic mixture.

In the case of a symmetric diketone like pentane-2,4-dione, the two ketone groups are on symmetric positions. So, when each is reduced, the two new OH groups can be either both R, both S, or one R and one S. But wait, if the starting material is symmetric, perhaps the product would form a pair of enantiomers, but in equal amounts. So, the product would be a racemic mixture of 2,4-pentanediol with configurations (2R,4R) and (2S,4S). Wait, because the molecule is symmetric, I think that the product would be a single diastereomer. No, wait. Let me think again.

Each ketone is reduced independently. Each reduction of a ketone with NaBH4 (a non-chiral reducing agent) would typically give a racemic mixture. However, in a symmetric molecule, the two reductions could lead to a single product. For example, if both ketones are reduced to the same configuration, the molecule would be meso. Because the starting material is symmetric, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, the meso compound.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric. So, when each ketone is reduced, the product would have two OH groups. Due to the symmetry, if the two OHs are on the same side, you get (R,R) and (S,S), which are enantiomers. But because the molecule is symmetric, the (R,R) and (S,S) configurations would actually be the same as each other due to a plane of symmetry. No, that's not correct. Wait, the molecule is symmetric, so if both OHs are R, that's one configuration, and both S is another. But the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4, so (R,R) is the same as (S,S) because of the symmetry. So, the product would be a meso compound, a single stereoisomer. Wait, but no, because the molecule is symmetric, the (R,S) configuration would be superimposable on itself, leading to a meso form. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think: the molecule is CH2(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, no, wait. Let me structure it correctly.

The product after reduction is HOCH2-CHOH-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let's properly structure pentane-2,4-dione. It's:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be four carbons with two ketones. Wait, maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Let me think again. The formula for pentane-2,4-dione is C5H8O2. The structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3? No, that's five carbons, but that would be 2,4-dio in pentane. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, wait, that's four carbons in the chain. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact structure.

In any case, the product of Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol, which has two OH groups. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product would be a meso compound. So, 2,4-pentanediol would be a single stereoisomer, the meso form. Because the two OHs are on symmetric positions, the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, despite having two stereocenters, the compound is meso and thus not chiral. Therefore, Reaction II produces a single product: meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait. How does NaBH4 affect the stereochemistry here? NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, it's not. So, when each ketone is reduced, each would form a racemic mixture. But in the case of a symmetric diketone, the combination of the two would lead to a meso compound as the major product. Because the two new OH groups can be both R, both S, or opposite. But due to the symmetry, the (R,S) and (S,R) configurations are the same as each other, leading to a single meso product.

But wait, when reducing each ketone, since the starting material is symmetrical, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer. So, 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so it's not chiral. Therefore, Reaction II gives a single product, meso-2,4-pentanediol.

Now, after both reactions are complete, the products are combined. So, what are the products?

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a secondary alcohol with two chiral centers: C3 (new) and C5 (original). So, the product has two stereocenters. Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone is reduced, a new chiral center is formed at C3. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with chiral centers at C3 and C5. How many stereoisomers can this have? Well, each center can be R or S, but the starting material is a specific enantiomer. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single stereoisomer because the hydride attack is from a specific face. So, the product is a single diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single compound with a specific configuration at C3 and C5. So, two chiral centers, leading to two stereoisomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but let's think: the starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced, the hydride attack could be from the same face or the opposite face, leading to different configurations at C3. But in a chiral environment, would that lead to a specific configuration?

I think that the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, with two chiral centers. So, it's one stereoisomer.

Reaction II gives a single product (a meso compound), which is not chiral.

So, when the products are combined, what do we have?

Product from Reaction I: one stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Product from Reaction II: one stereoisomer, which is a meso compound, so not chiral.

So, in total, we have two different products: product A (from Reaction I: one stereoisomer) and product B (from Reaction II: one stereoisomer, meso, so no chiral centers).

Now, when running these on an HPLC column, the type of column determines the separation based on the structure. A normal-phase HPLC column separates based on polarity, while a chiral column separates based on the presence and configuration of chiral centers.

So, for the normal-phase HPLC:

Product A is a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group. It's a polar molecule because of the OH and OMe groups. Product B is a diol, which is also polar. But wait, let's think about their structures.

Wait, product A is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It's a six-carbon alcohol with a methoxy group at C5 and an OH at C3. Product B is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a five-carbon molecule with two OH groups.

In normal-phase HPLC, the separation is based on the polarity of the molecules. More polar compounds elute later (retained longer) than less polar ones. So, the two products would have different polarities. Product B is more polar because it has two OH groups compared to product A, which has one OH and a methoxy group. So, in normal-phase HPLC, they would appear as two separate peaks. So, two peaks in the normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other products? No, because each reaction produces one product each. So, two products in total, leading to two peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Now, the chiral HPLC column. Chiral columns separate enantiomers and diastereomers. So, product A has two chiral centers. How many stereoisomers does it have? For two chiral centers, maximum four stereoisomers (two enantiomeric pairs). But in this case, product A is a single stereoisomer because it's formed from a single enantiomer starting material and a specific reduction. So, product A is a single stereoisomer.

Product B is a meso compound, so it's not chiral. It doesn't have any chiral centers, so it won't interact with the chiral HPLC column in a way that causes separation. So, in the chiral HPLC, product B would elute as a single peak because it's not chiral.

Product A, being a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, would also elute as a single peak because it's not part of a pair of enantiomers? Wait, no. Wait, a single stereoisomer would have a certain configuration, and it would be a single peak. So, product A is a single stereoisomer, so it would give one peak, and product B, being a meso compound, would also give one peak. So, in total, two peaks in the chiral HPLC.

Wait, that would mean two peaks in both HPLC columns, but none of the options match that. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.

Hmm, none of the options have two peaks in both. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let's reconsider Reaction I. The product from Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Does this molecule have any other stereocenters? If so, how many?

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, C3 becomes a new stereocenter. So, product A has two stereocenters: C3 and C5. Let's think about whether these are both present and whether they're in a configuration that creates multiple stereoisomers.

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. So, the rest of the molecule's configuration is set. When LAH reduces the ketone at C3, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which would have specific configurations at both C3 and C5. So, it's a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Then, Reaction II gives a meso compound, so no chiral centers.

So, when combined, the two products are:

1. A single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

2. A meso compound with two chiral centers (but not chiral overall).

Wait, wait. The meso compound has two chiral centers but is achiral because of an internal plane of symmetry. So, product B is a meso compound and therefore will not show any chiral behavior.

Now, in the normal-phase HPLC, the two products are non-chiral but structurally different. So, they would each elute as separate peaks. So, two peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer, so it would elute as one peak. Product B is a meso compound, which is not chiral, so it would also elute as a single peak. So, two peaks in total in the chiral column.

Wait, but the options don't have two peaks in either. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction I. Maybe the product of Reaction I has more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When the ketone is reduced, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. How many chiral centers are present?

The starting material has a chiral center at C5. After reduction, the product will have a chiral center at C3. So, product A has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Now, how many stereoisomers are possible for product A? For two stereocenters, there are 2^2 =4 possible stereoisomers. But if the molecule has any symmetry, some of these may be identical.

Wait, considering product A: if the molecule is such that swapping C3 and C5 would result in the same molecule, but I don't think so. So, the product would have four possible stereoisomers, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps only two are formed.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced, the new chiral center at C3 could be R or S. But under the conditions of LAH reduction, which is a strong, bulky reducing agent, the approach of the hydride would determine the configuration at C3.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a specific configuration at C3. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, the attack of the hydride would be from the less hindered side, leading to a specific configuration at C3. So, the product would be a single stereoisomer with configurations at C3 and C5.

So, product A is a single stereoisomer, product B is a meso compound. So, in the combined mixture, there are two compounds: one with two stereocenters (but a single stereoisomer) and one meso.

In the normal-phase HPLC, these would separate into two peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, the first product (with two stereocenters) is a single stereoisomer, so it would elute as one peak. The second product (meso) is not chiral, so it would also elute as one peak. So, two peaks in total.

But none of the options say two peaks in both. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two stereoisomers. How?

If the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3. No, because the starting material is chiral and the reaction is stereoselective. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and it typically leads to the formation of a single enantiomer because the hydride attacks from the less hindered face.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer. So, product A is one stereoisomer. So, in the chiral HPLC, it would be a single peak. Product B is the meso compound, a single peak. So, two peaks in the chiral HPLC.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the products.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, not a single stereoisomer. Let's think again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. On reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The molecule has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

The configuration at C5 is S (from the starting material), and the configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction.

In the reduction, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side. So, if the starting material is (S) at C5, the hydride would attack from a specific face, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

So, the product has a specific configuration at C3, leading to a specific stereoisomer. So, product A is a single stereoisomer.

Product B is a meso compound, so no chiral centers, so a single peak.

So, in chiral HPLC, two peaks. In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some products. Let me think again.

Reaction I: Starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After LAH reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, a secondary alcohol. So, that's one product.

Reaction II: Starting with pentane-2,4-dione. After NaBH4 reduction, the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So, one product.

Combined, two products. So, in total, two compounds.

In normal-phase HPLC, these two would be separated into two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer (two chiral centers, but a single configuration), so one peak. Product B is a meso compound, so it doesn't have any chiral centers and would elute as a single peak. So, two peaks in total.

But the options don't have two peaks in both. So, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a mixture of diastereomers. Let me think again about the reduction. If the ketone is at C3 and the starting material is a single enantiomer at C5, could the reduction lead to multiple stereoisomers at C3?

In the case of a cyclic ketone, the reduction could lead to axial vs equatorial attack, but in this case, it's a straight-chain ketone. So, the hydride would attack from the less hindered face. The starting material's configuration at C5 may influence which face is more hindered.

Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. So, the groups around C5 are arranged such that the methoxy group is in a specific position. When looking at the ketone at C3, the adjacent groups would influence where the hydride attacks.

So, when the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, it can approach from either the top or bottom face. The configuration of C5 might influence which face is more accessible.

Assuming that the hydride approaches from the less hindered face, the configuration at C3 would be determined, leading to a single stereoisomer.

So, product A is a single stereoisomer, product B is a meso compound.

Thus, in both HPLC columns, two peaks each. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction II. Let me think again.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. So, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol.

The product is 2,4-pentanediol. Now, the question is whether this product is a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

In the case of a symmetric molecule like 2,4-pentanediol, if the two OH groups are on opposite sides due to the reduction, the molecule would be meso.

Wait, the structure is O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. After reduction, it becomes HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me structure it properly. The correct structure of pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

No, that's not right. Let me correct this. The correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons, but the ketone groups are at C2 and C4. So, the structure is:

CH2(CO)CH2(CO)CH2CH3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I can proceed.

When NaBH4 reduces each ketone, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. The structure would be HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Now, considering the stereochemistry:

Each OH group can be R or S. Since the starting material is symmetric, the two OH groups can be both R, both S, or opposite.

But when the starting material is symmetric, the product would have an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, the product is a meso compound, which is not chiral.

So, product B is meso-2,4-pentanediol, a single stereoisomer.

So, the combined products are:

- Product A: a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

- Product B: a single meso compound with two chiral centers but not chiral.

So, in the normal-phase HPLC, two different structures, so two peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer (so one peak), product B is a meso compound (so one peak). So, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is actually a pair of enantiomers. Or maybe more than one product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, it becomes 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

The configuration at C5 is S. The configuration at C3 depends on the reduction. Let's say the reduction leads to a specific configuration at C3, making a single stereoisomer, so product A is a single stereoisomer.

Thus, when combined with product B (meso), the mixture has two compounds, leading to two peaks in both HPLC columns.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the number of stereocenters in product A. Let me count again.

Product A: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Chiral centers at C3 and C5.

So, two chiral centers. So, four possible stereoisomers. But if the product is formed from a single enantiomer starting material and the reduction is stereoselective, the product would be a single stereoisomer.

So, product A is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Thus, in chiral HPLC, product A is a single peak, product B is a single peak. Total two peaks.

In normal-phase, two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has more than one stereoisomer. Let me think.

Wait, when the ketone is reduced, the product can form either R or S configuration at C3. But because the starting material is chiral, perhaps the reduction leads to both configurations, but in a specific ratio.

Wait, no. The starting material's configuration at C5 would influence the approach of the hydride. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single stereoisomer.

So, product A is a single stereoisomer.

Thus, I'm confident that in the chiral HPLC, there are two peaks, and in the normal-phase, two peaks. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I. Let me consider the structure again.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a new chiral center at C3, but C5 is not a chiral center anymore? Or is it?

Wait, in the starting material, C5 has a methoxy group and two CH2 groups. So, it's a chiral center.

After reduction, C3 becomes a chiral center with OH, and C5 remains a chiral center with OMe.

So, product A has two chiral centers.

Thus, product A is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the normal-phase HPLC would separate based on the structure, but perhaps there's more than two products.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think about the possibility that Reaction I forms multiple products.

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, but in Reaction I, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would be a single stereoisomer.

So, product A is one compound, product B is another. Thus, total two compounds. So, two peaks in each HPLC.

But the options don't include this. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the starting material in Reaction I has a different structure. Let me think again.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Upon reduction, becomes CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

So, two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

Thus, product A is a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II gives meso-2,4-pentanediol, which is a single compound.

Thus, two compounds in total.

So, the number of peaks in normal-phase HPLC would be two, and in chiral HPLC, two.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of the chiral HPLC. If product A is a diastereomer in some way, maybe it would cause more peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps product A is a pair of enantiomers because the two chiral centers could form a pair that is chiral.

But no, product A is a single stereoisomer. So, it would be a single peak.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options.

Option B says 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

Hmm. Where would three peaks come from?

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think again. Maybe the reduction of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one leads to more than one product because of some other factor.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to more than one stereoisomer. For example, if the reduction isn't stereoselective, leading to a mix, but that's unlikely with LAH, which is known for stereoselective reductions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material isn't a single enantiomer, but the question states it is (S)-configuration.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the possible answers.

If the answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal.

So, perhaps in the chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer (1 peak), product B is a meso (1 peak), and something else (1 peak). But I don't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, leading to two stereoisomers, each of which would be separated by the chiral column. But I thought that LAH leads to a single stereoisomer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the product from Reaction I.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces a pair of enantiomers. Let me think: the starting material is (S) at C5. Upon reduction, the product has a new chiral center at C3. Depending on the configuration, it could lead to four possible stereoisomers. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would be a pair of enantiomers?

Wait, no. Because the starting material is (S) at C5, the configuration at C3 would be determined by the hydride attack. So, the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me think of the answer options again.

Option D: 3 peaks in both HPLC.

Wait, perhaps product A has two stereoisomers, product B has one, and something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction II.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione + excess NaBH4.

Wait, NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones, but in the case of a diketone, perhaps it reduces both ketones. So, product is 2,4-pentanediol.

But perhaps the product has four stereoisomers, but because the starting material is symmetric, it's a meso compound.

So, product B is a single compound.

Thus, in the chiral HPLC, product A (single) and product B (single) give two peaks.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product A having two chiral centers.

Wait, product A is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's see if any of the carbons are not chiral.

At C3: attached groups are CH2CH2 (from C2), CH(OH) (C3), CH2 (C4), and CH(OCH3)CH2CH3 (C5). So, four different groups: -CH2-, -OH, -CH2-, and a more complex group. So, C3 is a chiral center.

At C5: attached groups are OMe, two CH2 groups, and a CH2 group from C4. So, wait, the groups at C5 are:

- OCH3,

- CH2CH2 (C4),

- CH2 (from C6),

- and the CH2 group from C4 again?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the structure after reduction is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, maybe it's (CH2)2-CHOH-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons. C1: CH3, C2: CH2, C3: C(OH), C4: CH2, C5: CH(OCH3), C6: CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct the structure.

Wait, the starting material was 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

After reduction, it becomes:

CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

So, at C3: groups are CH2CH2, CH(OH), CH2, and a CH2 group from the next carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The structure after reduction would have:

- C1: CH3,

- C2: CH2,

- C3: CH(OH),

- C4: CH2,

- C5: CH(OCH3),

- C6: CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The structure after reduction would be:

CH3CH2CH(OH)CH2CH(OCH3)CH2CH3.

So, the molecule is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3.

So, C3 has the groups:

- CH2CH3 (from C2),

- OH,

- CH2 (from C4),

- and CH(OCH3)CH2CH3 (from C5? No, wait, C5 is the next carbon after C4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong, but the key point is that C3 and C5 are both chiral centers.

Thus, product A has two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps only two stereoisomers are formed.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction at C3 would create a new chiral center. Depending on the approach of the hydride, the configuration at C3 would be determined. So, the product would have a specific configuration at C3 and C5, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Thus, product A is a single stereoisomer.

So, in the chiral HPLC:

- Product A: 1 peak.

- Product B: 1 peak.

Total: 2 peaks.

In normal-phase HPLC:

- Product A and B: 2 peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of peaks in the chiral HPLC. Let me think.

In the chiral HPLC, product A is a single stereoisomer, so one peak. Product B is a meso compound, so it doesn't have any chiral centers and would elute as a single peak. So, two peaks.

In the normal-phase HPLC, two different compounds, so two peaks.

Thus, the answer should be two peaks in both, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about product B. Let me think again.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione + excess NaBH4.

The product is 2,4-pentanediol. Which is a meso compound, so it's a single stereoisomer.

But wait, NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but perhaps in the presence of excess, it leads to complete reduction, but maybe the stereochemistry is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps the product is a pair of enantiomers. Let me think: if the two OH groups are on the same side, the molecule would be chiral, but if they are opposite, it's meso.

But for a symmetric starting material, the product would be a meso compound.

Thus, product B is a single stereoisomer (meso), so one peak in chiral HPLC.

Product A is a single stereoisomer, one peak.

Thus, in chiral HPLC, two peaks.

In normal-phase, two peaks.

So, again, the answer isn't matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Reaction I, and product A has more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, but the starting material's configuration at C5 might influence that.

Wait, no. The starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Thus, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the product from Reaction I has two stereocenters, and the product from Reaction II has two as well but as a meso, leading to more peaks.

Wait, product B is a meso, so it doesn't contribute to the chiral HPLC peaks. Product A has two chiral centers, so one peak in chiral HPLC. So, two peaks in chiral HPLC.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the options again.

The closest option that makes sense is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase. But I can't see how there would be three peaks.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction I. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Product A: two chiral centers, so four possible stereoisomers. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, leading to a single stereoisomer.

Thus, product A is one stereoisomer.

Product B: meso, so one stereoisomer.

Thus, in the chiral HPLC, two peaks.

In the normal-phase, two peaks.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a single enantiomer but a racemic mixture. But the question states it's (S), so it's a single enantiomer.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

But I can't figure out why. Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC, and product B is a meso, leading to a third peak. But that doesn't make sense because product B isn't chiral.

I'm stuck, but based on my analysis, I think the correct answer is two peaks in both HPLC, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Rechecking the problem statement.

Wait, the question says after 100% completion, the products are combined and run on both columns.

Perhaps the products from each reaction are more than one. Let me think.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one â†’ reduced to 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione â†’ reduced to 2,4-pentanediol (meso). So, one product.

Thus, two products in total.

In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two stereoisomers. Let me think: perhaps the reduction of the ketone leads to a racemic mixture at C3, but the starting material's configuration at C5 doesn't influence it. But that's unlikely because the starting material is chiral and the reaction is stereoselective.

Thus, I think the correct answer isn't present, but perhaps the intended answer is option B: 3 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps product A is a diastereomer which splits into two peaks in the chiral HPLC, but I can't see why.

I'm going to go with option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC columns.

### Reaction I:
The starting material is **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**, a chiral ketone. When treated with LAH (a strong reducing agent), the ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, forming **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. This product has two chiral centers: C3 (newly formed) and C5 (retained from the starting material). Since the starting material is a single enantiomer and the reduction is stereoselective, the product is a single stereoisomer with specific configurations at both chiral centers.

### Reaction II:
The starting material is **pentane-2,4-dione**, a symmetric diketone. When treated with excess NaBH4, both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming **2,4-pentanediol**. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product is a **meso compound**, which is achiral despite having two chiral centers. Thus, Reaction II produces a single, non-chiral product.

### Combined Products:
After the reactions, the products are combined:
1. **Product A**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (single stereoisomer with two chiral centers).
2. **Product B**: meso-2,4-pentanediol (achiral, single compound).

### Analysis of HPLC Results:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**: Separates based on polarity.  
   - Product A is a polar molecule with two chiral centers.  
   - Product B is also polar but achiral.  
   - Since the two products are structurally distinct, they will elute as **two separate peaks**.

2. **Chiral HPLC**: Separates based on chirality.  
   - Product A, being a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers, will elute as **one peak**.  
   - Product B, being a meso compound (achiral), will elute as **one peak**.  
   - Total: **two peaks** in the chiral HPLC.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: 5 peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two products are formed, so this is not possible.  

- **Option B**: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both HPLC columns.  

- **Option C**: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both HPLC columns.  

- **Option D**: 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.  
  - Incorrect. Only two peaks are expected in both HPLC columns.  

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the correct answer should be **two peaks in both HPLC columns**. However, none of the provided options match this result. Given the structure of the question and the available options, **Option B** is the closest match, likely due to an oversight in the problem setup or interpretation.
