Okay, so I've got this question about barley and some gene mutation. Hmm. Let's try to figure this out step by step. 

The problem says there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for that compound has five exons and four introns. So, the goal is to eliminate the compound by mutating the gene. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some changes in the first exon.

The question is, which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound? The options are mutants 1 to 4, and the choices are A to D.

Looking at the sequences:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... etc. So the first part is the beginning of the coding sequence, probably the start codon (ATG) followed by some other nucleotides.

Now, let's look at each mutant.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene:
The first part is ATGTTTCTC... but mutant 1 has ATGTTCTAC. Oh wait, so the sixth base in the intact is T (position 6?), let me count. Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT etc. Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT. So the fourth codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant 1 it's TAC. Wait, that's the third codon perhaps.

Wait, let's count the nucleotides. The first 15 nucleotides of the wild type are:
1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGA

In Mutant 1, the sequence is:
1-3: ATG
4-6: TTC
7-9: TAC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT

So the second codon in wild type is TTT (Phe), in mutant 1 it's TTC (also Phe). So that's a silent mutation. The third codon in wild type is CTC (Leu), in mutant 1 it's TAC (which is Tyr). So the third codon changes from Leu to Tyr. So that's a missense mutation.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the beginning:
ATG TTC TAA GCT etc. So first, same as mutant 1, TTC at positions 4-6. Then, TAA at 7-9. TAA is a stop codon. Oh wait, that's a problem. So in position 7-9, the wild type had CTC (Leu), and mutant 2 has TAA, which is a stop. So this would cause a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. But is that helpful? The gene product is the compound, so if the protein is truncated, perhaps it's nonfunctional. So the compound might not be produced. But I need to think about how the compound is synthesized. If the gene is for the enzyme that produces the compound, truncating it could prevent the enzyme from working. So this might be a good mutation to eliminate the anti-nutrient.

Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at the beginning:
ATG TTT TAC GCT etc. So, the first few codons:
1-3: ATG (Met)
4-6: TTT (Phe)
7-9: TAC (Tyr)
10-12: GCT (Ala)
13-15: GGT (Gly)
Wait, in the wild type, the first few codons are ATG TTT CTC GCT GGA...

So, in mutant 3, the third codon after ATG is TTT (Phe), same as wild type? No, wait. Let's see:

In wild type, first exon starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGA ... So, the second codon is TTT. In mutant 3, position 4-6 is TTT, so same as wild type. Then, position 7-9: in wild type it's CTC (Leu), in mutant 3 it's TAC (Tyr). So, same as mutant 1, perhaps. But then, position 13-15 in wild type is GGA (Gly), but in mutant 3, after GCT, it's GGT? Wait, no, let me recount.

Wait, the wild type has ATG TTT CTC GCT GGA etc. So, the third codon is CTC (Leu), fourth is GCT (Ala), fifth is GGA (Gly).

In mutant 3, the sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT ... So, second codon is TTT (same), third is TAC (Tyr), fourth is GCT, fifth is GGT (Gly). So, same as wild type except for the third codon.

But wait, further on, mutant 3 has a change in the next codon too. Wait, the wild type continues as TACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... So, after GGA, it's TACTTCT... which is TAC (Tyr), then TTCTGT (maybe another codon). But in mutant 3, after GGT comes TCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So, after GGT, it's TCA CT... So, that's TCA (Ser), then CTG (Leu), etc. So, in wild type, after GGA, it's TACTTCT... So, the fifth codon in wild type is TAC (Tyr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val). In mutant 3, after GGT, it's TCA (Ser) as fifth, then CT (so the sixth codon is CTT (Leu?), or wait, let me think. Wait, the fifth codon in mutant 3 is TCA, which is Ser, and the next is CTG. So, in wild type, the fifth codon was TAC (Tyr), sixth TCT (Ser), seventh GTG (Val). In mutant 3, fifth is TCA (Ser), sixth is CTG (Leu), seventh is TGG (Trp). So, this introduces multiple changes, leading to an altered amino acid sequence. So, a missense mutation in multiple places.

Mutant 4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at the beginning:
ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG etc. So:

ATG (1-3), TTT (4-6), TAC (7-9), GCT (10-12), ACT (13-15), TCT (16-18), GTG (19-21), etc.

Wild type: after the initial ATG, TTT, then CTC (7-9), GCT, GGA, TAC, TCT, GTG...

So in mutant 4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), and the fifth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGA (Gly). So multiple changes, including a possible frameshift? Wait, no, because the number of nucleotides hasn't changed. Wait, the first part of the mutant 4 is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCT..., which is 15 nucleotides? Let me count:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT... So each codon is 3 nucleotides. So the first five codons are:

1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TAC (Tyr)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: ACT (Thr)
6: TCT (Ser)
7: GTG (Val)
...

In the wild type, it's:

1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGA (Gly)
6: TAC (Tyr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
...

So, in mutant 4, codon 3 is TAC instead of CTC (Leu to Tyr), codon 5 is ACT (Thr) instead of GGA (Gly). So, multiple missense mutations. But wait, does this cause a frameshift? No, because it's substitution, not insertion or deletion.

So, which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound? The gene product is probably an enzyme that synthesizes the compound. So, if the enzyme is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

Looking at the options:

Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon early on. If the gene produces a truncated protein, maybe the enzyme doesn't function. That could eliminate the compound.

Similarly, the other mutants have missense mutations. Whether they disrupt the function depends on which amino acids are changed and their importance in the enzyme's structure.

But the question is which mutation would most probably eliminate the compound. So, a truncation mutation (premature stop) would likely cause a nonfunctional protein. So, mutant 2 might be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the sequences.

Mutant 2's first part: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGA... So, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be truncated after the second amino acid. Because the first codon is Met (1), the second is Phe (2), and the third is stop. So, the protein would be only two amino acids long, which is way too short to have any function. So this would likely eliminate the compound.

Mutant 4 has changes that might not disrupt the reading frame but change several amino acids. If those changes are in critical regions, it could disrupt the enzyme. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

But the question is about 'most probably' eliminating the compound. A frameshift or a premature stop is a strong candidate for rendering the protein nonfunctional.

So, looking at the options:

Option A is Mutant 2. Option D is Mutant 4.

Wait, the options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

So, Mutant 2 is option A.

But wait, I thought mutant 2 introduces a stop. So that would produce a nonfunctional enzyme, which would not produce the compound. So option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about the synthesis of the compound. If the gene is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made. So, I think Mutant 2 would achieve that.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question says, after sequencing, the changes are at the beginning of the first exon. So the mutations are in the first exon.

Does the first exon contain the start codon? Yes, because the start is at the beginning. So, a mutation in the first exon could affect the start or early codons.

Mutant 2's sequence has TAA (stop) at position 7-9. So that would cause the mRNA to be translated until the second amino acid (Phe), then stop. So the resulting protein is way too short to function. So the enzyme wouldn't be made, and the compound wouldn't be synthesized.

So, the correct answer would be Mutant 2, which is option A.

To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the given mutations and their potential effects on the gene's function. The gene responsible for synthesizing the compound consists of five exons, and the mutations occur in the first exon. The goal is to identify the mutation that disrupts the gene's function, thereby preventing the compound's synthesis.

### Analysis of Each Mutation:

1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - The sequence shows a missense mutation at the third codon (CTC in the wild type changes to TAC, altering Leu to Tyr).  
   - This mutation does not introduce a premature stop codon or disrupt the reading frame. The resulting protein may still be functional, depending on the importance of the altered amino acid.

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - The sequence introduces a premature stop codon (TAA) at the third codon.  
   - This results in a truncated protein with only two amino acids (Met and Phe). Such a protein is likely nonfunctional, as it is far too short to perform the enzyme's required function. This would prevent the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - The sequence shows multiple missense mutations, including changes at the third codon (CTC to TAC, altering Leu to Tyr) and subsequent codons.  
   - While these mutations alter the amino acid sequence, they do not introduce a premature stop codon or disrupt the reading frame. The protein may still retain some functionality, depending on the critical regions affected.

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - The sequence shows multiple missense mutations, including changes at the third codon (CTC to TAC, altering Leu to Tyr) and the fifth codon (GGA to ACT, altering Gly to Thr).  
   - These mutations alter the amino acid sequence but do not introduce a premature stop codon or disrupt the reading frame. The protein's functionality depends on the importance of the altered regions.

### Conclusion:
The most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon, resulting in a nonfunctional protein. This would prevent the synthesis of the compound entirely.
